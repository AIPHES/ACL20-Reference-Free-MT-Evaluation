Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on the introduction of administrative responsibility for violation of the deadline and the procedure for paying for goods (works, services) when purchasing for state and municipal needs.
This law is designed to address the very acute problem of non-fulfillment of obligations by customers in the implementation of state and municipal purchases.
Two years ago, the situation when entrepreneurs could not get paid for already executed state and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the Russian president instructed the General Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem for special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who entered into unfunded contracts, tried in every possible way to evade payment commitments and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the whole country.
Since 2015, in the interests of protecting the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment for public orders, the prosecutor's office made 9.7 thousand submissions, 4,500 officials were brought to disciplinary responsibility, 533 were brought to disciplinary responsibility, 533 were brought to disciplinary account, 75 materials were submitted to investigative bodies for the organization of procedural inspections, 46 criminal cases were initiated.
As a result, more than 66 billion rubles in arrears to entrepreneurs were repaid.
And these huge sums accumulated far from the failure to pay multibillion-dollar contracts.
To the fabulous debts led numerous, systematic delays in paying services to entrepreneurs at a much more modest amount.
Here is a characteristic case.
The head of a small company won a tender for the provision of social transportation services for several million rubles.
The man invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled his obligations, but he did not receive the money in time.
The result is a growing financial com- pany of debts on wages, taxes, loans, which would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not seek help from the prosecutor's office.
Now in a number of regions the problem has been maximally leveled.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the aggregate amount of debt on state and municipal contracts, identified by the prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical levels, the prosecutor's office works in the mode of manual crisis management.
The Prosecutor-General personally conducts outreach meetings with representatives of the local authorities, who thoroughly examine all the violations discovered by prosecutors and measures for their immediate elimination.
Such operational meetings have already been held this year in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
The implementation of the Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation in the part of establishing administrative responsibility of the customer's officials for violating the deadline and the procedure for payment for goods (works, services) in procurement for government and municipal needs", which the Russian president signed last week, will improve qualitatively the payment discipline of public customers.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Prosecutor General's Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses with an article that provides for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 rubles for violation by the customer's official of the term and procedure for payment for goods, works and services for state and municipal purchases.
And if the official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offense, he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All the prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative innovations in practice.
Civil Rights Protection Group announced a travel alert in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri, due to discriminatory state policies and attacks on racist grounds.
The group's statement reads: "The warning for travelers of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, valid until August 28, 2017, encourages African-American travelers, guests and citizens of Missouri to be particularly careful and to be extra careful when traveling around the state due to a number of dubious racist incidents that have recently occurred throughout the state and are listed here."
According to the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population, the group announced a movement warning that prompted the recently adopted law in Missouri, which made it harder for people to win discrimination claims, and that state law enforcement bodies disproportionately choose minority representatives for their objects.
"People are subjected to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of their skin, they are beaten and killed, "Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population of Missouri, told Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints often, like never before."
This is the first warning of this kind declared by the organization in relation to the US state.
The group referred to incidents such as the blacking of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gasoline on a state trip, and the Missouri police arrested him without charge of a crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office, according to which the probability of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 percent higher than for whites.
"The purpose of the warning is to ensure that people are aware of the situation and have warned their relatives and friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People should be somehow prepared, whether they will take money for bail or tell their relatives that they are traveling across the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime report, 100 hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, making the state the sixteenth in the state in terms of the number of such violations.
Also, the travel warning is a response to the new Missouri law, after which it will be more difficult to bring a case against a legal entity in connection with housing or labor discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced warnings for travelers to Texas and Arizona after these states adopted new immigration control laws according to which local law enforcement agencies were ordered to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which, according to the ACLU, should have increased the number of racial checks.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Department of State in relation to other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people died as a result of firing at a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown fired a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reports citing the Egyptian Interior Ministry.
During the shootout, two people, including one policeman, were killed, three people were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcers.
One of the attackers was detained, the second managed to escape.
Rosturizm supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-return tickets
Head of Rosturism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with the RBC television channel that he "positively" refers to the adoption of a law on the abolition of free baggage allowance for non-refundable air tickets.
"We need to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has baggage," he stressed (quoted by TASS).
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of citizens, it is not necessary to pay for the transportation of outer clothing and mobile phones in hand luggage.
"It would be right to calm all our citizens and tourists and say about it, to say that it will not have any relation to the outer clothing, the umbrella, the mobile phone, the ipad or even any computer," the head of Rosturizm said.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the provision on free baggage transportation for a non-refundable air ticket.
The point is that airlines themselves can determine the number of seats and the weight of baggage included in the non-refundable tariff.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate the pollution of Lake Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the protection of Lake Baikal said that in recent years, significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to identify sources of funding, plans and executors to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin also instructed to conduct a full reclamation of contaminated areas.
"It is necessary to understand and with the objects that continue to work here, the treatment facilities of most of them are worn out," - quotes RIA Novosti.
He also added that the General Prosecutor's Office of Russia should conduct an audit to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the lake area there are problems associated with the emergence of spontaneous landfills and a number of violations in the field of ecology from the organizers of the rest.
"I want to emphasize this: not everything is tested, it is necessary to know the measure here, but it is - illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General's Office reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of facilities subject to environmental supervision.
Recall, June 15, Vladimir Putin in a straight line said the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural areas of a special regime of protection.
The residents of Olkhon Island, who enters the Baikal natural territory, informed him about problems with conducting economic activities.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources Sergei Donskoi immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but the government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are related to a number of regulatory acts.
Previously, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by changing the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
A new temple will appear in Ugra
In the village of Sosva, members of the community of representatives of the indigenous peoples of the North "Rakhtynya", together with residents of the Berezovsky district, take part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is a river bank, the temple will be well seen from afar, so it will serve as a beacon for fishermen.
According to the representatives of the community, construction work will be completed this year, now there are domes, church bells are available.
The Igrim fleet of the fleet provided transport support.
The temple is named in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, as he is venerated by the Orthodox Church as the patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosva, fishing gives settlers a job, feeds them.
Local residents are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write in school essays about it as a local landmark.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why are laws in Singapore respected?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in the diner in the open air.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, cigarette butts neatly stocked in an iron box, which was tucked away from the office.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - a hundred meters to her - and throws bulls into it.
The penalty for garbage in a public place is 500 local dollars, "Chang says.
You know, I've just developed a reflex from my childhood: you can not throw a candy wrapper from candy to the pavement, instantly fined.
And now there are video cameras everywhere.
And indeed - the sidewalks of Singapore in the city center are clean, as if in a museum.
Chang says: three months ago, an 18-year-old son of his neighbor painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced to flogging.
What ?!
Imagine yourself.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in jail.
In general, corporal punishment is not uncommon.
As in Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly severe laws, the on-the-spot reviewer of AiF understood.
Here, no one thinks to abolish the death penalty, "explains lawyer Viktor Li Hong.
And the government has long been spitting on the views of both the European Union and the US on this matter.
If a person escorts a large consignment of drugs or trades with them - he is hanged.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport: he was carrying 400 grams of cocaine with him.
In his defense, the Australian prime minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights activists and even the Pope of Rome spoke.
However, the guy was eventually hanged.
After this, drug couriers our country diligently go round the side.
The thing is this: in Singapore it is required that laws must be observed ALL in a row, not just modest and poor people.
It does not matter who you are - a millionaire, a vice-premier, a famous artist or an EU resident.
The option in this case is one: if you find a pound of cocaine, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you meet the tablets with a bunch of warnings, it's simply amazing how much in this city-state of prohibitions!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly according to the prescription (!) Of the doctor.
The tourist does not take the cud on arrival, but it is worth sticking an "elastic" in the metro, a fine of 1,000 local dollars will be punished.
For four days I met two people with white plates on their necks: "I littered."
For an abandoned urn, a cigarette butt is often sentenced to a "wake-up call": a week to clean parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles pays "criminal" who forgot to wash the water behind him in the public toilet, and when trying to fix a small need in the elevator of the apartment house a special detector is triggered - doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the very exotic laws - prohibitions on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive watering of the houseplant (!): It is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
To avoid fires smokers can not carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they will fined 5 thousand Singapore bucks.
In general, there is an idea: no matter how hard you try, you must break something.
This is not so, - Mohammed Kabir-Qajariya, the owner of the local travel agency, tries to disassemble me.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and for the last twenty years I have not seen anyone involved in their violation.
Why are they saved?
That citizens do not relax.
The observance of the basic rules is strictly followed.
For example, if a juvenile sells cigarettes in a kiosk, everyone will be punished by the chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the intruder will receive sticks on the "back", and the seller will also be spanked and imprisoned.
It is due to such severe laws that offenses in Singapore are very rare.
Is this justified?
Back in the seventies we were in a state of chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wanted, got drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of fines for the year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having drunk a portion of whiskey, knows: if they stop, the policeman will not let go for a bribe, they will impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and for years will be sent for jail.
To many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems like a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty" - a guest from the United States terrified the general wealth of the inhabitants, "frighteningly clean airport" and "cultivated nature."
Say, these things are unnatural, look artificial, and so in principle should not be.
The first days in Singapore and rightly afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, you'll remember if you went into the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the area of "Little India", and suddenly - a "break of the template": plastic cups lie at the bus stop.
"And how is it?" - you are surprised.
And that's it, - the Singaporeans grin.
Anything can happen.
Not for each such "crime" grabbed on the spot, but you should know: if you are calculated, do not otmazheshsya - because you broke the law.
Most often this is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often snatch smartphones and cameras from the hands of tourists.
In the center of Paris is full of dirty homeless people and beggars.
On our streets, too, not everyone is trying to throw garbage into the urns.
Singapore, on the other hand, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws has become the most calm, clean and safe city on Earth.
You will become thoughtful.
This is human nature: remember, and in Russia no one was buckled behind the wheel until they were fined.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not penalties, but voluntary compliance with laws.
And we have to think, in Russia, people in Russia would also be happy about the clean streets, the lack of garbage in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with a public toilet.
Here are corporal punishment - thanks, do not.
Otherwise, the laws of Singapore at least worth it to look at them.
Nothing sacred?
Now Trump's White House set his sights on the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he begins to fight against the statues.
Americans understand this no worse than all the rest - hence the deliberately theatrical demolition of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of Trump's government, no doubt knew what he was doing when he brought a symbolic ax over the Statue of Liberty during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the president's proposals for a drastic reduction in legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller did not attempt the statue itself.
The hordes of owners of pleasure boats and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried to do it.
But he attempted on its meaning, and especially on the meaning that was attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when poems by Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller grumbled at Acosta: "I do not want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem that you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller correctly stated the facts, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
This is about the current sound of Lazarus' striking words, the only ones in which the state invites not all immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming to breathe freely, / The unfortunate scum of your abundant shores."
Never before had the "unfortunate garbage" been so visible on our screens.
Miller did not study literary criticism - he made it clear that in America Trump these people are not expected.
This debate about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it's really a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who fought to put her words on the socle of the statue after her death - knew very well that they were doing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to indicate the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classic figure - the female image of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she received a completely different name: the Mother of the Exiles.
The combination of the poem and the image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack against American nativism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right though to change it back.
The thunderous Rush Limbo, a kind of John the Baptist who ushered in the advent of Trump, in 2010 argued that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neo-conservative, carrying the flame of America to the world lying in darkness: "Freedom is moving forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to illuminate the way in the United States. "
Against the usual Limbaugh here really hit the mark.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by emaciated, unhappy, but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
It means to literally look at the world through the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue responds to them with the words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And, of course, this is not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to recognize.
Their torch is needed not to light the way, but to kindle hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
World Cup 2017: Neil Blake highly appreciates the Scottish members of the British team.
Eilid Doyle recalls the time when in the British national team there were only two Scotsmen
Neil Blake, the director of the game of the Federation of Athletics of Great Britain, said that the 16-member Scottish part of the team at the World Cup will make "a significant contribution to the team's game."
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for the London championship starting in Friday, 2017.
Blake believes that in Scotland "something special is born" and the Federation of Athletics of Great Britain should take this into account.
"We know this and try to understand and support it, as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
"I talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's related to what they did.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that with what they have done, it is necessary to work.
The British Athletics Federation: with what they did, it is necessary to work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I do not know why it happened, but it's absolutely brilliant. "
Some of the Scottish athletes are claiming medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Buchert - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 m, and Eilid Doyle chose the team as his captain.
"Eilid is modest.
Her captain's speech was great, "Blake says.
"Many athletes, regardless of whether they are Scots or not, and from where they live or train, left this room, feeling pride and a spirit of victory.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eilid put into her were wonderful. "
The holder of the silver medal of the Commonwealth Championship, which at its fifth World Championship will run a distance of 400 m with obstacles, says that 16 Scots in the British national team is "unbelievable."
The previous record for the number of Scots in the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Ahead is Laura Muir, who specializes in running for the middle distance and has beaten five British and two European records last year.
It will run at 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will participate in the 1500 m race, is another Scotsman who should be paid attention to: behind him is a successful season in which there were victories in the qualifying competitions of the British national team and at the Annual competitions.
Doyle recalls her first World Cup, when, in addition to her, the only Scotsman in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots have not only entered the national team, but in some cases will claim the medals and fight for the final.
"The team captain is chosen by the other team members, that is why it was a great honor in any case, but to know that your comrades voted for you and chose you - for me it's a very special thing," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who entered the national team.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all accomplished athletes, who will strive to get on the podium.
And what about my captain's speech?
Yes, I think she was not bad.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from fans and take advantage of the fact that we will once again find ourselves at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go to his arena and take part in competitions, and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful. "
Blocking critics on Facebook: you do not need to be promoted to public office if you are not ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
Americans loved George Washington, but that did not stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Of course, the criticism irritated him.
But he did not shut his mouth to his critics.
Because back in 1783 Washington said: "You can take freedom of speech and we, deaf and dumb, will be led like a sheep to the slaughterhouse."
Now I will go to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And this week the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him for this.
The subordinate governors called this claim insignificant, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "so what?".
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But this is also important.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is a surprisingly popular Republican governor in a predominantly democratic state.
He is in second place in the approval rating among 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He demonstrated a firm hand in managing the state and adherence to his principles.
He also cleverly uses Facebook as the primary way of communicating with his constituents and jokes on his page showing his bald head after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is declared as an official public forum and conducted by the administration's employees with taxpayer money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia Ches defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking comments is simply their moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and hayters who are angry on the Internet.
"The Post" talked to some of the real people Hogan had blocked.
And these are real people, not trolls - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor, who turn to their elected leaders.
All of them say that their comments were respectful, informative and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan is a Catholic.
Lakshmi's lawyer Sarma Ramana from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by the lack of his reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comment section on the article in the Post.
"I also do not like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say that this is a so-called cheating, rather than admit that they are dealing with a large group of dissatisfied citizens."
What the governor's subordinates call a "concentrated spam attack", others, probably, would be called an "active life position."
In the era of Facebook, it's easy to edit your image, simply by blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is much less dusty work than before, when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and muffling protesters.
But this is exactly what is happening now, only in the figure.
Hoheng is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were banned in his Twitter account.
One of the first, pivotal decisions on this topic was taken this week in Virginia.
According to the US District Judge from Alexandria James K. Kesheris, the chairman of the Loudon County Supervisory Board violated the First Amendment by busting the voter in his account in Facecbook.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bavin was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
During the era of Washington, the era of available postage cost has made about the same revolution as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800 the number of newspapers grew fourfold, and the authors of anonymous letters severely brought down its authority.
And even then Washington dealt with anonymous trolls.
People with pseudonyms "Yurikola", "Valerius", "Belizarius" and "Porcius" wrote letters to newspapers mocking Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the online project "Documents of George Washington," his cabinet was filled with petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he did not try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means acceptance.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for convenience in the club "Renaissance"
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes for convenience for the next three days, when the Renaissance club in East Lothian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
A native of Northern Ireland who led the neighborhood at the Archerfield Links club and moved towards the final round last year until he lost to Paul Ilsu, is affixed to the new venue and serves as the tournament's representative on behalf of the club's founder and director Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw how the Renaissance club was being built, and we are watching him come to success with this event," Rafferty said.
"Players will see this field at its best moment, it's in excellent condition.
Jerry did a great job setting up this place.
He is an ardent supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
This is an excellent demonstration for this field. "
The Englishman Ils looks forward to the opportunity to defend the champion's title for the first time, despite the fact that in his 32-year career he won both in the European tournament and in the tournament "European Challenge Tour".
"It's really a special feeling," said the Southport player.
"I did not manage to try again to win the Extremadura Open, because it was removed from the schedule one year after I won it.
Returning to this corner of the world is magical.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back, but for me and my wife Sharon was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time, and we will always remember it. "
Gary Orr, who joined the European tournament for elderly athletes, returns to battle in his native land after he turned 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first appearance in public in Scotland since the tournament "Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open" in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always a little more important," said the resident of Helensboro, Orr.
"You want to perform well, but you feel this additional burden."
I played with great pleasure again, and I showed good golf.
I am pleased with how everything is being achieved so far. "
on the field to this trio will join the former winner of the tournament "Masters" Ian Vousnem and the champions of the major for older athletes Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former captain of the Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the field, the rest are Andrew Aldkorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs 5 pounds per hour, if there is one person in the car, and 10 pounds if the person is two or more.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Specific tunnels above the highways, capable of absorbing the carbon monoxide emitted by cars, are already being tested on the roads of Great Britain.
The country's transport agency, according to the publication of Autocar, reported on the positive results of testing a 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The tunnel is 6 meters high, built of some new polymer materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in automobile exhausts.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the UK authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce the road traffic on the roads, expand the use of commercial vehicles on electric traction and upgrade the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all atmospheric pollution falls on transport, and unsatisfactory air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Moscow City Court changed the punishment for disabled Mamayev to a fine
The Moscow City Court changed the punishment for disabled person Anton Mamaev, sentenced to four and a half years in prison, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office asked the court to replace the sentence with a provisional one, explaining its request to the fact that Mamaev's illness "prevents him from being in prison."
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years of imprisonment with serving a sentence in a general regime colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces fighter.
On July 19, the court at the exit session in the SIZO freed the man from custody.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian "golden land"
While preparing dinner, Bardeen Degei does not use a stove.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniyai County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply places the sweet potatoes, which here is called the "note", right into the hearth.
Half an hour later the charred tuber is removed and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the earthen floor - she has no furniture - and it is here that she does her housework, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket is a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of four wives of her husband, and therefore she was not instructed to work in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and yet there are soldiers.
"No one dares to walk around the village after five in the evening," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, publicly raising their hands before the occupying forces.
The current movement, in favor of independence from the Netherlands, quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights activists.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as remote as the one abandoned, the road here includes an hour and a half flight from Jayapura, the administrative center of the province, in Nabire, and then a five-hour jolt on a rented car.
There is no public transport here.
The city with a population of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, corrugated steel roofs are rusted in a variety of rusty shades.
Here got very few of the Indonesians, not to mention the journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries of the Papuans, the Pago worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"It was unusual for us to wear these clothes," says Degei, pointing to his bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
"Previously, we only wore leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, 28% of its population lives below the poverty line, and the child mortality and literacy among the worst in Asia.
But still it is Indonesian golden land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran company, is only sixty miles from Paniyah, a high-mountain province about the size of New Jersey, home to 153,000 people.
Only in 2015 the company "Freeport" produced gold and copper here by about $ 3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua boasts forest resources, the cost of which is estimated at 78 billion dollars.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for the Papuans, ensuring that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia retain their suffocating presence here.
According to the New York Times investigation in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid almost $ 20 million to local soldiers and units, including up to $ 150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the Papuans threaten the existence of this golden vein and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, since 1969, Indonesian military forces have killed more than 500,000 Papuans, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, massacres in the highlands of Papua inhabited by indigenous people in the seventies can be considered genocide.
Only last year the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We will lose everything," the report, published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture - especially as reported in another report, rape and electric shock - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims, because the incidents take place every week," says Andreas Harsono, who studies in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The nuts dragged on, as Papua's resources attracted an influx of migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
The region's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but demographic indicators change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan shops, "varungi", sell fried chicken and a mixture of vegetables "gado-gado", served with peanut sauce.
Local residents are trying to withstand competition.
"Migrants began to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the indigenous people of Papua," explains Abet You, a twenty-four-year-old Paniyai who moved to Jayapura, the province's administrative center, because of her work.
"Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua - mama-mama (women) of Papua - have lost their market."
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, popularly known as Djokovi, vowed to address inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniyah.
But in Papua almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken, because in 2014 we voted for Djokovi, expecting that he will fulfill our hopes for the restoration of justice," says Yo.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Djokovi Paniay experienced a tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was on the street and sang Christmas carols at the fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers rushed out of the dark on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and after a while returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk, chased children and beat them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Yaimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone lit a nearby government building of the election commission, and the next day the situation escalated.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed a white, dance of Papuan tribe me Pago: they ran around in circles and depicted bird singing.
Some protesters began to throw stones at the police station and the military base.
When the situation became hot, the soldiers were ordered through internal radio communication: "If the crowd protests more than three times, shoot them," as it sounded, according to an official document seen by TIME correspondents, but which was not published in local media.
The fifty-six-year-old Eremias Kayame, the head of the Kego Koto district in Enarotali, sensed the approach of danger and called for calmness, turning to the crowd with a request to disperse to their homes.
Nobody wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned around, a bullet hit me in my left wrist," he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says that the bullet flew from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots," he adds.
The local resident Alfius Jouva was hit three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, tells.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Johannes told TIME magazine, which, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him."
General Yotja Mende, Senior Inspector of the Papua Police, told reporters that his officers merely "defended" their base, because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Commissioner Pujo Sulistio said in 2015, the Papua police spokesman.
"This is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed, and much more was wounded.
The news of the murders reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovy spoke in Jayapur with an ardent speech in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to tackle the issue of the historical abuse of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be settled immediately so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Vieranto, said he would establish an extra-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately went the excuses.
"Most of the violations occurred long ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or at the beginning of the zero ones.
The fact is that we definitely want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be passed, "he said.
Then Wiranto gave up his words, speaking with TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he did not plan to establish an organization to handle complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said: "Everything will be decided through the court."
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people during the bloody vote for the independence of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniyah incident.
Families of victims from Paniyah met similar statements with a grim suspicion.
"Over the past three years, I was questioned four times, but there was absolutely no change," says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid that the military will arrest me, I'm afraid they'll shoot me."
His brother Jakobus also expressed the opinion that the residents of Paniyah are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury the four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came for me," he says.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in the nearby Deyan district of Paniyai.
During the clash between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help take the unconscious man to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 more were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dove, drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested before the office of the construction site owned by the company.
According to the police, villagers threw stones at officers who responded with warning shots.
But local residents claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retribution," - told the magazine TIME twenty-nine-year-old Domingung Badia, who lives near the hospital and saw how hastily the wounded were delivered.
"I was hiding in my house for two days."
Parliament Deyayi demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to account, and the mobile police brigade was recalled from this region.
Paniyai has always been a sore spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development causes dissatisfaction with the tribes of me, moni, tribute and damal scattered throughout the greens of central highland areas of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), an insurgent army that claims to protect the rights of the Papuans by arranging sporadic attacks and raids on kidnapping Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniyai, including Thadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoia.
In retaliation in recent years, thousands of people were arrested in Paniyai and groundlessly detained by the military under the pretext of "protecting national independence".
Some never returned.
Among the population of Papua, Paniyah is considered a "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice, sold in Enarotali, is too expensive for local residents.
Bread is in the same exact degree inaccessible.
People here grow everything they eat: basically, a note, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of which can take care of four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Usually they save most of the crop for the family, and the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten tuber notes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic disparity between indigenous Papuans and new migrants has increased, which came in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nabire airport.
Few existing vacancies usually go to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuans rarely have enough money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village ... because there is no work, no money," says John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council Paniy.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain harsh.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Eskyudi and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for "lack of coordination with relevant organizations" despite the fact that they were given rare permits for video filming.
According to Felima Keene, deputy director for Asia of the organization Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the pre-election campaign of Djokovy to lift restrictions on the work of the media in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebellious eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
Lack of attention from the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is mainly limited to the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including shooting at Paniyay.
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arramanath Nasir, dismissed the group's statement, informing reporters in Jakarta that "There is still a democratic system in Indonesia and there is a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations."
Local residents want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Netherlands Ambassador for Human Rights Kiys Van Baar, visited Jayapur on May 4, the locals broke the silence, praying: "We want freedom," according to a source who was also present at the meeting, but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, in 2019, a new presidential election will be held, but the Papuans say that they are unlikely to vote again for Djokovi.
"Djokovi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting at Paniyai," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Djokovi to know that the inhabitants of Paniyah, in addition to being in the shadow of a threat from the greedy army, are mired in poverty, and education and health care are in a pitiful state.
Gobay says that the inhabitants of Paniyai, like other Papuans, consider their voice given to Djokovi as a duty that he must pay.
"They do not need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Paniyai carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims in a plot of land directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never triumph, they, at least, will not allow the guilty to forget about their crimes.
"They killed a member of our family," says Yakobus, without raising his head.
"What else could we do?"
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper "Torch"
The fire enveloped one of the world's tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to hastily leave the seventy-nine-story structure at 337 meters high.
This is the second fire that swept through the high-rise building - which coincidentally is called "Torch" - for two years.
The building was evacuated, no human casualties were reported, and there were no operational news about the cause of the fire.
"We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "a skyscraper, named George, told Reuters.
According to the Civil Defense Department of the city of Dubai, the fire brigade extinguished the fire at about 4:00 local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government reported that it is working to provide asylum to the victims.
The incident can return to the agenda the safety issues of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
During the investigation by the administration of "Fakela" after the fire there in 2015 it became clear that the most severe damage was the cladding - external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said that they believed that the insulation system and cladding panels of the Grenfell Tower in London could accelerate the spread of the fire that occurred there in June, which killed about 80 people.
The growth of the tourist flow in Ida-Virumaa in June was minimal
As follows from the data received by the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, a total of 20 519 local and foreign tourists used the services of hotel companies in the Northeast, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists decreased, while foreign tourists grew.
Thus, the foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12 944 to 12 525 people.
The most noticeable increase in the region was the number of Russian tourists - by 8.9% or 318 people compared to June 2016.
In total, in June 2017, 3885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed in Ida-Virumaa hotels.

In Afghanistan, the explosion of a car killed five military
At least five servicemen were killed in the explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, RIA Novosti reported.
According to the police, on the eve of the night near the military checkpoint in Girishk district, a car bomb exploded.
It is known about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new state of emergency occurred in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked the exchange office.
The firefight between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver shot a video on his shark
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal (Greg Skomal) captured a video of a shark who bit his action camera GoPro.
The video posted on Facebook the division of the US Marine Fisheries Agency in the state of Massachusetts, whose employee is Skomal.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeastern United States, the Necn portal specifies.
The man during scuba diving tried to remove the shark on the camera, which he kept on a special stick.
Noticing a man, an animal more than three meters long swam to it.
The shark began to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator did likewise to determine if the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that this behavior of the marine animal was a novelty for scientists.
The reason for the mass brawl in the Ural military center became known
A training group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived to investigate the circumstances of the incident at the Elansk training center, where a mass brawl occurred.
Already some of the details of this massacre became known.
According to Mash's public data, which appeared on the "VKontakte" page, the contractors of the Ural military unit number 31612 fought badly because of the unoccupied bed.
It all began with the fact that a private named Sayan defiantly ignored the order of the officer to fill the protruding sheet.
Servicemen from the sixth company rose to the side of the officer.
Sayan was supported by the first company.
For half an hour 140 young guys were defeated in the barracks beds and shells, knocked out the glass.
In the mass brawl, more than ten people were injured.
The Central Organ had denied information about the stabbing.
The study showed that at least one-fifth of passengers in the US are carrying prohibited items on the plane.
The study showed that more than 20 percent of air passengers deliberately or accidentally carried in the baggage on board the plane through the security checkpoints of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent boarded the plane, inadvertently carrying illicit knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 percent reported that later they discovered that they accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The study, conducted by the charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and involving more than 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something that is prohibited by ATB, 19.7 percent were millenial compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X.
Deliberately, ATB employees often bring food and water.
More than 3 percent admitted that they carried sharp objects through inspection, and 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents admitted that they deliberately carried illegal drugs to the plane.
The company said that it had been examining passengers across the country to find out how many of them accidentally smuggled through airport check-in, and how much they consciously did.
It is quite expected that most often - consciously or unconsciously - smuggle smugglers through the inspection of those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the rules of ATB are rather complicated and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry and how many.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of what ATB selects is prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that the ATB might consider books banned for transportation.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Head of EPA Pruitt refuses to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted by Obama on reducing emissions
The day after the lawsuit of 15 states, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency canceled his decision to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted by Obama, designed to reduce emissions of substances that pollute the air and lead to the formation of smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by saying that now his agency is more than in previous administrations, listening to the needs of environmental regulators in individual states.
He did not mention the lawsuit against his previous position, filed with the federal appeals court.
The dispute spun around the October 1 deadline, to which the states must ensure compliance with the 2015 Ozone Standards at ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would defer compliance for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid "inconsistency with local solutions or obstacles to economic growth."
Pruitt, who before being appointed President Trump for his current position, was the Attorney General of Oklahoma, was long known as a consistent opponent of tightening environmental regulations.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of norms that the chemical or gas-oil industry was against.
Unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Pewitt to return to previous standards.
Last month, the federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA exceeded his authority, trying to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, having drastically changed course on ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the EPA's responsibility to cooperate with the states in the complex process of timely implementation of new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often could not meet the deadlines, then waited for claims from activist groups and others and discussed the timing of the settlement," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen claims against the EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We are also serious about our charter and the power that it gives us. "
However, the EPA statement said that Pruitt may at some point again use its "powers to delay and other statutory powers" to make sure that the norms are "jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information."
Republicans in Congress insist on a broader review of the rules relating to ozone.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
Attorney General of New York Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed a lawsuit this week against the EPA, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
"The changes in the EPA course - after our lawsuits - are an important victory in the struggle for health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that covers their cities," Sneijderman said.
The suit of New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ozone at ground level occurs when ordinary pollutants from machinery, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants and other sources enter the atmosphere in response to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health advocates and environmentalists welcomed the unexpected change in Pruitt's course.
"It's sad to think how much pressure was needed to achieve this absolutely logical step from the person who is entrusted to protect the air we breathe," said Laurie Ann Bird from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."
The IAAF Congress extended the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (VFLA).
Thus, the congress supported the IAAF council for the restoration of VFLA, which issued a report on Monday, recommending that the suspension be maintained.
166 people have voted for the extension of the suspension, 21 against, - TASS.
The report of the IAAF Council said that VFLA made significant progress towards meeting the conditions set by the council for the restoration of membership, but these conditions have not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of VFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian athletes were forced to compete under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
VFLA was indefinitely disqualified by the IAAF in 2015.
Then was published the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound, which spoke about numerous violations of WADA regulations, allowed by Russian officials and athletes.
Read more about the latest report of the IAAF council in the material "b" "IAAF has extended sanctions for VFLA."
Insulting defeat
Within the framework of the 3rd round of the Russian Football Championship among the teams of the PFL, Novomoskovsk "Chemist" conducted an away match against FC "Kaluga".
Just over 10 days ago, rivals played among themselves in the Cup of Russia, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"Chemist" in no way inferior to the opponent, but a second relaxed at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat from kaluzhan with a score of 0: 3, many in advance predicted an easy victory for the hosts.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the New Moslems forced themselves to reckon with themselves and acted from the defense, but from a position of strength.
In the 1st half, the kaluga players created more and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was held by Alexei Sirotin, who several times repelled dangerous blows and with his actions gave partners confidence.
Unfortunately, in the attack, "Chemist" lacked the effort and luck to puzzle the defense of "Kaluga" and score the first goal on the road.
After the break, the game began to flow in oncoming courses.
Novomoskivtsy actively played in the attack.
Alarming errors for our team were errors in the defense, which allowed the Kaluga people to create a series of acute moments.
10 minutes before the end of the meeting, "Chemist" intercepted the territorial advantage and conducted several dangerous attacks.
But the Kaluzhan's experience played a role - they were more competent and coolly held the ending, waiting for their moment to score the goal.
After a dangerous attack, "Chemist" moved the ball to the corner, which the hosts gave the hosts without resistance to the gate.
The author of the goal was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, "Chemist" showed a good game, but suffered an insulting defeat.
Ahead of our team is waiting for another exit - August 11 at 19 o'clock in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named after Eduard Streltsov, the New Moslems will compete with the favorite of the "Center" FC "Ararat", which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come and support the "Chemist!"
The place and time of the meeting of the New Muscovites is at 18:30 near the Magnolia store (Vostochnaya, 2, bldg.
The composition of the "Chemist": Sirotin, Manokhin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogia (Oreshkin), Dudaiti, Ryzhov, Svyatov, Belyanin (Adoyevtsev), Andreychenko (Lygin)

According to the published transcripts of the telephone conversations, Trump pressed Mexico on the payment of the wall at the border
The Washington Post has published transcripts of phone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieta, Trump insisted that he stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The US president scolded him for publicly speaking against the wall, and, according to leaked information, told him: "You can not tell this to the press."
Trump began his election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed that he would force Mexico to pay for the project.
The published transcript of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a heated squabble.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the US should accept refugees traveling to Australia was "ridiculous," "disgusting," and "dumb," and insisted that because of the agreement concluded by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot, as he intended to stop the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump concluded the conversation by telling Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant conversation for the whole day."
The bodies of the tourists who died in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane, belonging to the airline "Russia", carrying the bodies of the Russians who died in Abkhazia, flew at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, TASS reported.
On the site of the final destination, the board will be met by the staff of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the mayor's office, Deputy Minister for Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamyr Akhba told journalists.
Previously, the representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic stated that all the expenses related to the delivery of the bodies back to Russia were assumed by the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay compensation to the families of the victims in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Akhba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed readiness to pay for the relatives of the tourists who died as a result of the explosions of tourists and stay in the republic, but relatives sent only powers of attorney to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On August 2, approximately at 16:20 Moscow time, in the village of Primorsky in Gudauta district, two explosions thundered in the stock of rocket and artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic, after which they began to detonate large-caliber projectiles and other ammunition stored there.
As a result, a fire occurred in the storage room, which provoked uncontrolled explosions of projectiles of various modifications.
As a result of the accident, two Russian citizens died - Elena Polyakova, born in 1970 and Elena Timofeeva, born in 1962, who were on holiday near a hydrogen sulphide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were taken to medical facilities of the republic with various degrees of severity.
Currently, seven people remain in the hospital, the rest are discharged.
A big jury will study the Russian influence on the American elections
Special Attorney for Russia Robert Muller convened a grand jury in Washington, which will study the influence of Russia on the election of the US President in 2016, according to The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offenses and have the right to interrogate witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will be examined by the special prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to bring charges.
The convening of a grand jury gives Müller additional authority to collect testimony.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury, which began work several weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son of then presidential candidate Donald Trump with Russian lawyer Natalya Veselnitskaya.
Check details of this meeting, held in June 2016, previously promised and Muller himself.
They have already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. previously said that from the meeting with Veselnitskoy he was waiting for compromising information on the headquarters of the candidate from the Democratic Party Hillary Clinton, but no revealing documents were presented, and it was eventually about adoption.
In early August, a number of media reported that Trump Jr.'s statement about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by Trump-senior.
The White House clarified that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would have done.
Vice-mayor of Penza was detained in the workplace
The deputy head of the Penza administration, Irina Shirshina, was detained for 48 hours on the instructions of the Investigative Committee at her workplace, RIA Novosti reported.
Official reports from law enforcement agencies on this issue have not been received, but the press service of the SU CS assured that they will soon follow.
In the mayor's office of Penza has not commented on what happened.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She oversaw town planning issues and land relations, holding this position since April 2015.
Before that, she had worked for a long time as the head of the Goszhilstroytekhinspektsiya administration in the Penza region.
Irina Shirshina brings up three underage children, it is noteworthy that once again becoming a mother a year ago, she refused a maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, in Mexico there is no cosmodrome, no carrier rockets.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first person who has been in space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are demolished in some countries, the monuments to Gagarin, on the contrary, "walk on the planet".
In 2012, the monument was installed in American Houston near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was installed in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first space flight.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in Erfut, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin, a monument to Yurius Gagarins appeared in Riga.
So the name and surname of the first cosmonaut in Latvian sound, and he looks as if he turned 70 years old.
Murder at Morse Ford: activists lose Lynch courts on stage to call for justice
"Ford Mercury" in 1948 drove past the audience in the village of Monroe in the state of Georgia and rushed to the small bridge Morse Ford.
When the car, in which there were four black passengers and a white driver, drove up to the bridge, a group of white men with guns barred her way.
Chief - a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin strip - tightened a cigar and looked through the windshield.
Those sitting inside trembled with fear.
"We need this nigga, Roger!" The man snapped.
"Get him out of the car!"
Piercing wails broke the silence when a young black man was dragged from the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which took place on July 22, is just a dramatization.
But when the neck of the "Roger" threw a noose, almost all the audience really held their breath.
Since 2005, activists are returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to re-play the night when in 1946 the Kukluklasses lynched two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malk and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's amazing that for all these years no one has been arrested - although we see them side by side, although we know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"This is a blot on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Congress of Georgia, who has struggled for his human rights all his life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the inhabitants of Monroe that injustice has not been corrected.
"We want an investigation, we want to complete, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he says.
"We can not go on to healing and reconciliation until we reach justice."
The coroner covers the body of one of the victims of lynching at Mors Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI materials received by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of involvement in lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects remained free for decades, human rights activists say that in the city they always knew two related motives of lynchers: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the ruling of the Supreme Court for the first time allowed black citizens to vote in the primaries, which were to be held that summer.
Approximately during the same election, according to FBI reports, the black-skinned Roger Malcolm struck in a fight with the knife of Barnett Hester, a white landowner - apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that, according to rumors spreading in the city, Hester was sleeping with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she was to give birth was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $ 600 bail to rescue Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove from prison and drove up to the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of lynchers surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and commanded the killings of Harrison," - such a conclusion is made in one of the reports of the FBI.
"It is also clear that there was a collusion between law enforcement agencies of the state and the city, who not only participated in the murders, but also destroyed the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt on the voting rights," he said.
"They were all killed to send a black signal to the city: if you register and vote, you will be the same."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Green has been directing an annual spectacle that reproduces the lynching at the Morse Ford bridge.
Her performance is obvious, it captures the viewer and narrates about that deep racism, which, as many would like to consider, there is no more in America.
It's hard to watch and even harder to turn away, but Green believes that this is the main thing.
"We do not want to talk about the Lynch courts, because they show us our own ugliness," she says.
"But I can not build a relationship with you if you do not hear me or hear what I experienced."
Rehearsals of this year's performance began in June, and on the first day of almost 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest black ones - gathered in the room and listened to the review of the play polished over the years.
Wade Marbo was a director along with Green.
For several years he played the role of the main member of the clan, but says that the role has not become easier.
"It seems to me that I got dirty, because it's not the kind of person that I am," Marbo says.
"But I believe that it is very important to remember this story, because we do not want to return at that time."
In the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Raskona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
Spectal begins with the fact that Malcolm, furious that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screams and pushes him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!".
Shouts of Raskona in response.
A blow is heard.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Green laughs loudest.
"What is" - asks Ascona.
He is concerned and embarrassed.
I'm overacting?
"No," Green says through his laughter.
"I just do not think that whites then said 'nigga'."
"Yes, yes," one of the black performers laughs.
"You have to make a solid 'r'".
And the energy in the room is changing too: discomfort is replaced by a feeling of comradeship.
All should do everything correctly, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the sake of the memory of four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Raskona speaks the word "n", it turns out to be sharp and sharp.
No man laughs.
The performance ends cruelly and quickly.
Shouts, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of actors and performs a sad song of Billy Holiday "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
A hundred yards from her, fifty spectators are wiping tears and sweat from their eyes.
Among the audience is almost equal number of black and white.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York to see the show, many live very close.
They all endured the heavy stiflingness of Georgia for almost eight hours, while Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until that moment, murders remained only a story, but now, when they are standing in the same place where people lynched, it seems that their ghosts are hovering right there in the air.
When the last note of the song fades, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children bend over to their heads, touch the paint, depicting blood, and motionless bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," one small boy mumbles, as if to remind himself of this.
After a few minutes Green thanks the audience, and suddenly everything ends.
Actors throw the ropes off their necks and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbo, a man in a suit who played the main Kuklukklanovtsa.
Nick Raskona embraces two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the play finally fell upon him.
"It's all right," whispered one of the women.
"We know that your heart is good.
You had a reason for this. "
Later spectators sit down to have supper together with actors.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta is animatedly discussing the play with the black couple they just met.
Deniz Daplinski hardly finds words to describe what she feels after the performance.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, terrible words, and the actions of ... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think that lynching is still happening," she adds, "only now it's called what the police shoots."
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks took over the general attention, who remembers his work as a human rights advocate for food.
He says that he has already begun to plan the next year's performance.
"The production inspires us, because it not only describes the horror of what we experienced, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you do not learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it. "
The court fined Navalnogo for violations on the "agitation cleanout day"
Simonovsky court of Moscow fined Alexey Navalny for 300 thousand rubles for violation of the order of the organization of the rally.
The oppositionist was found guilty of committing an administrative offense under Part 8, Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation "Repeated violation of the procedure for organizing a rally."
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovsky Court of Moscow, Khyzyr Mussakaev, finished considering the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the headquarters of the oppositionist Aleksei Navalny, who was brought to justice under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the "campaign pick-up", which supporters Navalny held in Moscow on July 8-9.
Seeing the propaganda materials that followed the participants of the subbotnik, the police found that the organizers of the event intentionally concealed its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to ask permission from the authorities in Moscow beforehand).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev petitioned for the termination of the administrative proceedings in connection with the absence of the offense and pointed out that the police made some mistakes in drafting the protocol.
Volkov was not detained at the "propaganda work day," but he received a summons obliging him to appear at the police station for an account of the event held with his active participation.
The same agenda was received by Navalny himself and another associate of the oppositionist Nikolai Lyaskin.
In Mordovia, the bride was shot and three guests of the wedding were arrested
A court in Mordovia arrested a local resident who shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported in the republican department of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of 29 July.
During the quarrel 42-year-old resident of Saransk shot several times at the guests of the event who came to the rural pond to swim.
As a result, three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been opened for the "a" part 1 of Article 213 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Hooliganism"), Part 3 of Article 30 and Article 105 §§ 2 (a) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Attempted to kill two or more persons in a generally dangerous manner, out of hooligan motives").
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire due to the fact that the guests of the wedding, having decided to swim, passed through the territory of his site to the pond.
The Ministry of Energy will tighten requirements for suppliers of turbines for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for providing information to suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
When launching gas turbines, hydro power plant turbines, oil pumping facilities and oil production, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share data on access to it from the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft government decree is already ready and submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will only concern "critical energy equipment" supplied to Russia.
Potential threats in the document include such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of the object by foreign special services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
The EU expanded anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
The press service of the European Union on August 4 said that anti-Russian sanctions were expanded due to the scandal surrounding the supply of Siemens turbines to the Crimea.
This was previously reported "Arguments of the Week."
The press service of the Council of the EU stated that sanctions against the Russian Federation had been widened due to the scandal with the turbines produced by Siemens, which allegedly were delivered to the Crimea bypassing the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe considers all possible complaints and proposals by member states to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was reported that the final decision will be made before the end of the day, and now the decision is made, the sanctions against Russia are expanded.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, the British educational group of companies Pearson announced that it will cut another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 percent in connection with the launch of another restructuring program aimed at combating the problems that their business faces.
These job cuts, which, according to the head of the company, John Fallon, will mainly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, occur in addition to 4,000 jobs, reduced in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it plans to cut costs by an additional 300 million pounds ($ 394 million) in May during the third cost-cutting program to try to bring back to life the business that hit a fast transition to digital teaching methods.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner, the Bertelsmann concern, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1 percent increase in primary product sales in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on the escort in Kabul: Nato's soldier was killed in a suicide attack
According to information received from official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, as the NATO report says.
According to unconfirmed reports from local sources, as a result of the incident, three civilians were also killed in the urban district of Garabagh.
This explosion is the last of the bloodshed that struck Afghanistan this month: on Tuesday, as a result of the explosion in the mosque in Herat, more than 30 people were killed.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion that occurred on Thursday evening happened when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with the help of a man-made improvised explosive device.
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and receive treatment in the US military hospital at the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the "Islamic State" (IG) in Karabakh is the main source of concern for NATO forces deployed near Bagram.
According to UN reports, in the first half of 2017 in Afghanistan, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties, and about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, the explosion of a suicide bomber killed at least 30 people in a Shia area in Kabul.
The Taliban stated that they had attacked.
On May 31, as a result of a powerful explosion in the center of the city, more than 150 people died - this is the most serious terrorist attack in the country since the troops led by the United States in 2001 removed the Taliban from power.
Violence accentuates the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump assesses whether it is necessary to increase the number of US military forces that assist the troops and police in the country.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul over the past few weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its line of conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency after the lawsuits revokes the decision to postpone the adoption of the law on air pollution
The US Environmental Protection Agency canceled the decision to postpone adoption of the Obama era law, according to which states should limit air pollutants one day after 15 states sued the agency because of this step.
In the evening on Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called "ozone measurements-2015", stressing that this step shows the Agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in a dialogue with our partners in the states and responsiveness to them," the head of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone measurements of ozone in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced in order to meet more stringent air purity standards for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, together with the Federal District of Columbia filed a lawsuit claiming that this intention was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations introduced by previous President Barack Obama within the framework of a broader program aimed, according to Trump, for brilliant economic growth.
But actions in this direction have provoked resistance from democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
On the website of the Environmental Protection Agency it is written that the use of air containing ozone for breathing can "worsen the function of the lungs and intensify respiratory symptoms", for example, asthma.
Association of European Business Opposed New Anti-Russian Sanctions
The Association of European Businesses expressed disagreement with the US economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to the AEB, such measures can lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB statement says that business is one of the important links between countries and people, therefore it is not possible to restrict the principles of free trade.
European business brings together more than 500 companies from the EU countries and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the US and Russia to work out a new line of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask the police to limit traffic on the embankment in Pskov
Pskov people's deputies sent an appeal to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the city of Sergey Surin about the problem of movement along the embankment of the Velikaya River.
Deputies of the city Duma Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Partyenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their opinion, control over drivers will help make this territory more calm and safe.
The problem is that violators ignore the signs of the "Footpath" and freely skate along the embankment.
It turns out that major repairs and landscaping conducted in vain.
Sports and children's playgrounds become uncomfortable because of cars.
As noted by the Pskov Information Agency, in the evenings the central embankment is patrolled by staff of the PSP motor bike patrol and druzhinniki.
Thanks to them, the number of passing cars is getting smaller, but the traffic does not stop completely.
Putin asked the investigating authorities not to remove the hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed to prohibit investigative bodies from seizing servers and hard disks from working computers in enterprises.
The head of state said this at a meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary "to exclude the application in the interests of the investigation of measures leading to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the removal of hard disks from working computers and servers."
Putin noted that if the investigators have such a need, "it is enough to make copies, assure them and use them during the investigation."
The head of state added that it is impossible "to create conditions that hamper the continuation of the enterprise's activities up to the impossibility of paying taxes."

The Russian Foreign Ministry urged Washington to stop defaming Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted to statements by Mike Pens, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The foreign ministry spread the relevant statement some time ago.
In his comments, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using the stamps of the Cold War, inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the US authorities to stop defaming Russia.
As the "Arguments of the Week" wrote the day before, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organizing an unsuccessful coup d'état in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is talk about the possibility of a decisive match
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seem to be moving steadily towards having the most exciting match in boxing in weight up to 147 pounds in the near future, first met on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the office premises of the ESPN channel in Los Angeles, while Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, did not go down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization champion in the second semi-lightweight division.
After the unanimous victory of Garcia over the former world champion in four weight categories by Erian Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both boxers are among the top five boxers, regardless of weight categories.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said: "How are you, champion?
Good luck to you. "
Lomachenko defends his belt in a duel with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven in the evening on the ESPN channel.
When the boxers posed for the photo, the manager of Lomachenko Egis Klimas noted that a potential decisive battle between them would be just right.
"I used to be light-weight," Garcia reminded.
"I went up in the category for the sake of Brooner [up to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm too small for 140.
I want to go down to semi-easy.
And he needs to climb up to a lighter [up to 135 pounds], and then we'll arrange a duel.
This is what the fans want.
Let's arrange it for them. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the fight should be broadcast via PPV service as part of the strategy that he adheres to Lomachenko held his debut fight in weight later this year to schedule a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 KOs) next summer who is also interested in fighting the winner of the duel between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the lightweight title in the Forum arena on September 23.
"The fight may be on PPV, because all the fans asked for it," Garcia said, after expressing his willingness to fight on the channel that offers the best financial conditions.
"We are the main names.
No other names will not cause such interest.
As soon as they are ready ... "
Garcia said that he considers Lomachenko "a terrific boxer" and, perhaps, will visit his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko did not immediately shower Garcia with praise and said that, in his opinion, the champion in three scales from Riverside looks "very slow, sorry, Mikey ... you were asking for a knockout."
Garcia said that he focused on showing the power of the blow, and then boxing.
They both said that they feel the tension growing before their own duel.
"This fight should take place.
No other fight causes so much interest and talk.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I was waiting for someone from the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great fight. "

In addition, the Russian leader asked to take measures if the facts of violations were revealed.
New test results are published to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new method of medical age evaluation, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons were rated as over 18 years of age, but not all trust the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish national forensic medicine agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment in the asylum procedure more accurate after the Swedish Migrationsverket was criticized for not being able to determine the real age of some refugees who claimed to be underage.
At the moment, Migrationsverket sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of the test subjects were rated as people 18 years of age or older, and for another 25 cases, the forensic agency estimated that the test person is "probably a person of 18 years of age or older".
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "is probably less than 18".
Tests are conducted only in cases when the age of a person is in doubt.
According to Johan Görensson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with the results over the past months.
"We do not see much difference with the statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases "most likely, the age of the tested 18 years or more."
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper "Svenska Dagbladet" found that in 243 cases a person openly declared that he was performing 18 this year.
The method of conducting medical age evaluation, which consists in making an x-ray of wisdom teeth and tomography of the knee joints and giving it to an analysis of dentists and radiologists, also caused criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is the endocrinologist from the Karolinska Institute Claude Marcus, part of whose work is assessing the biological maturity of people to determine if they have gone through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I had reasons to think about this, and I do not think that we need to use the measurement methods that are used now.
The biological age is thus very inaccurately determined.
If we can not define it with confidence, we should not pretend that we can, "he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Görenssen from the Forensic Medicine Agency was in favor of the accuracy of the tests: "In general, we can say that the risk of mistakenly accepting the child as an adult is small.
With the greatest risk, we encounter when a person will soon be 18, in which case it is about 10 percent. "
I think, whether to run for the presidency
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin announced that he was ready to think whether he would run for president of Russia in the elections in 2018, "Interfax" reports.
This statement was a reaction to the request of the residents of the village of Cheryomushki, Buryatia region.
During the videoconference dedicated to the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and the Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election is over, we all ask you to run again for this post."
"Well, I'll think about it, thank you," the president said in response.
On July 28, Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov commented on some media reports that Vladimir Putin's election headquarters will be headed by the head of the presidential administration Anton Vaino.
Peskov called these assumptions "on anything not based, hypothetical reasoning."
"While there are no staffs, before the creation of headquarters far, before the election campaign far," - said Peskov.
"So far it's not on the agenda," Peskov said.
The governor of West Virginia said that he was moving to another party
The governor of West Virginia, the representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday during a rally with President Trump that he is moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I am telling you with many prayers and many reflections ... today I tell you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of use to you, remaining a governor-democrat."
The meeting burst into applause.
"So tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republican," added Justice.
"As a coach, I would tell you that it's time to play differently."
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at the rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia by a margin of 42 percent, and Justice did not support a Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justis, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His condition is estimated at 1.59 billion dollars.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee on Thursday issued a statement that "the transfer of Governor Justice to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which rather hinders, than it is working to make our country great again."
"Considering only 15 governors and controlling the least number of state legislatures in history, the statement of Governor Justice is just another refusal from a party that has no leaders from top to bottom and is not able to find a positive, unifying message," a spokeswoman for the Republican Party's National Committee Ronn McDaniel told CBS News.
Heavyweight cat named Mr. Krasavchik found the house thanks to social networks
The nursery of Pittsboro (North Carolina, USA) has attached a cat named Mr. Pretty Boy weighing more than 14 kilograms after he became famous thanks to the Internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June in the kennel's Facebook account a photo of a cat was published asking to find its owner, because "it was obviously someone who had fed it before."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the muzzle of an animal can become a new meme.
The publication scored more than 3.2 thousand likes and 15 thousand comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to shelter Mr. Krasavchik.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to take up his excess weight.
In an interview on WNCN radio, an American woman told that she already had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now it weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users paid attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
The post with a photograph of the animal collected more than 68,000 views.
Commentators noted that she could well make a career in the modeling business.
Coe praised the "sincere" apology of Russia in connection with the doping scandal
International athletics specialist Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called sincere apologies from Russia in connection with the doping scandal, but repeated that now is not the time to again allow the country to participate in sports competitions.
The Russian representative of the athletics federation Dmitry Shlyakhtin reported at the congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which took place on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all athletes who have stolen gold and silver medals at the competitions".
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on found evidence of the use of doping, funded by the state.
"It seemed to me that today's answer, today's report was very sincere," the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations Coe told reporters.
"The whole council and the entire Congress liked ... that the Russian Federation itself recognizes that it has experienced extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation."
Coe said that he also "liked" that Russia agreed with the criteria for its recovery.
"I think that it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission, according to which now is not the time to restore Russia's rights," Coe said.
"In the next few months, we must do everything to settle this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from a tainted system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations, will participate in the World Athletics Championships under a neutral flag, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations Rune Andersen said on Monday that a number of requirements still need to be fulfilled to restore Russia.
As he told reporters in London after a report made on the advice of the International Association of Athletics Federations, drug testing is still not carried out in sufficient volume, and detached coaches are still doing their job calmly.
Court arrested Ukrainian journalist suspected of state treason
Detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) journalist Vasily Muravitsky sent under arrest for two months, the SBU reported.
An employee of the Internet publication Zhitomir Magazine is suspected of treason by placing his publications on Russian websites and encroaching on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering this a "barbarous policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship "Comandante Borsini" entered the territorial waters of Libya in order to stop the inflow of illegal migrants together with the Navy of this country.
The decision to start the operation was taken by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control much of the country's territory.
Opposing the cabinet and the Libyan parliament based in Tobruk accused Italy of violating the sovereignty of Libya.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, gave his subordinates an order to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they said that they do not believe these threats and intend to send another military ship to the Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the negotiations of the Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the Libyan cabinet recognized by Europe, Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities went to the establishment of a naval mission to combat illegal migration after the statistics on the number of illegal immigrants arrived from Libya in July: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The government said that resources for the reception of migrants have been exhausted.

Users for some time could not receive and send messages.
Two leaders of the Ukrainian national track and field team were suspended from participation in the World Cup
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povkh, specializing in running short distances, are excluded from the national team of Ukraine for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the website of the Athletics Federation of the country (FLAU).
This decision was made by the executive committee of the organization in connection with the initiation by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings against athletes.
From the composition of the Ukrainian delegation is also excluded coach Zemlyak Sergey Basenko.
As reported by Sportarena, IAAF suspects athletes in the use of doping.
Povh - the bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championships, the European Champion 2010 in the relay race 4 to 100 meters, the Countryman is the winner of the European championship in 2012 in the relay 4 to 400 meters.
The World Athletics Championships in London will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football will affect the transfer of Neimar to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending on the part of European football clubs will not prevent the transfer of Neimar from the Spanish "Barcelona" that put the world record to the French Paris Saint-Germain.
Any consequences may follow further on the chain, for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body that controls European football, in whose power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
From the rules of the financial fair play, introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that PSG will eventually have to show that the transfer of Neimar was financed without major losses.
"Barcelona" was paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) just to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of moving Neimar to France.
PSG can definitely fork out to hire Neimar and add it to the galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them at the expense of legitimate sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
"FFP" was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs climbing into huge debts in their pursuit of success, in fact, cheated and risked ruin in the event that banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, "FPP" stopped focusing on the debts of clubs and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with good potential, and then earn a lot in order to improve the team and create a global brand - has become a difficult plan.
During this three-year evaluation period, exciting 2018, clubs can suffer losses of 30 million euros.
And, despite the fact that Platini was shamelessly removed from the presidential post in 2015, his successor in UEFA Alexander Cheferin is still determined to restrain excessive spending.
"Of course," FPP "is alive, and we, moving forward, will tighten the rules," - said last week to the agency "Associated Press" Andrea Traverso, who controls the "FPP" in UEFA.
Although PSG will pay for the purchase of Neimar's contract at a time, he can, for reporting, distribute this amount throughout the term of his contract.
Neimar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer fee can be shown in annual accounts as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of "FPP" sanctions in 2014, "PSG", as well as "Manchester City", owned by Abu Dhabi, were heavily sanctioned.
PSG was fined 60 million euros (at the rate of 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit the composition of his team in the "Champions League" during the season 2014-1015, 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA monitors clubs that can try to outwit its financial inspections, inflating their income at the expense of companies associated with the owners of the club.
Although the Qatari company could sponsor PSG, but if the amount of financing was considered to be higher than the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of funding for "PSG" by the Qatari Tourism Authority was inflated.
It was reported that part of the earnings of Neimar in the "PSG" could come in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
But the "PSG" and Qatar-2022 deny that Neymar will become the ambassador of the World Cup, and such a maneuver could easily be found by the inspectors of UEFA.
Past sanctions imposed on the "PSG" means that UEFA will further closely monitor any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday, people familiar with the situation, UEFA did not conduct preliminary discussions with the "PSG" about the transfer of Neimar.
They communicated with the Associated Press Agency on condition of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest published reports, in 2015-1016, PSG received more than 10 million euros in profits with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Reporting for the last financial year has not yet been published.
PSG expects that the arrival of Neimar will be a fertile ground for sponsorship deals, the sale of paraphernalia and T-shirts with the team logo.
The club suggests that the turnover will increase by at least 30 percent due to hiring a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best players is leaving, the Spanish league tried to prevent the transfer of Neimar, saying that "PSG" would violate the financial "fair play".
"This is an obvious case of" financial doping, "with the club and the state," said Javier Tebas, President of La Liga, to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that the ultimate owner of PSG is Qatar.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's doubts about the club's financing of the club.
"It's all the consequences of equity participation, and it completely changed the landscape of football over the past fifteen years," Wenger said Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to observe the financial fair play, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and places of the oath will be determined by the president
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation, the president will determine - such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law were developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Building.
A week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the order of taking the oath in law.
From the solemn oath, children under the age of 18 will be released, as well as incapacitated, follow the amended text of the amendments to the bill "On Citizenship of the Russian Federation" (available to Izvestia), which the committee will consider on July 11 before the second reading at its meeting.
The idea to introduce the oath when joining the citizenship of the Russian Federation instead of formal signing of documents, President Vladimir Putin supported on June 6 during a meeting with State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies drafted this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading in a bill that would cancel the decision to grant citizenship to those who subsequently were convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public calls for terrorism or for publicly justifying it in the media or on the Internet (Part 2, Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code); and also for hijacking a plane, train or water transport;
According to the draft law, his logic was this: when a person signs a document for citizenship, a person signs under the promise to comply with Russian legislation - embarking on the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
The bill was introduced in April by Duma faction leaders Vladimir Vasiliev (United Russia), Gennady Zyuganov (Communist Party of the Russian Federation), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov (Fair Russia) and State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the State Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but now it has been reworked.
Now it says that the order of taking the oath will be established by the president of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On Citizenship of the Russian Federation," stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn atmosphere before the state emblem and the Russian flag in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - the list of places where the emblem of the Russian Federation may be placed is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of state bodies of subjects, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could have been registrars.
Speaking solemnly, people wishing to obtain Russian citizenship will be after officials verify their documents.
But a Russian passport will be received by a person only after he takes the oath, follows from the revised text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text says that Russia will be sworn with 18 years, not with 14.
A rule has been preserved, according to which legally incapacitated or severally capable persons will be released from taking the oath, as well as those who can not pronounce, read or autographically sign the text of the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to release from this procedure and "other persons",
Also, in the updated draft law, a special procedure for the admission of citizens of Ukraine to Russian citizens is considered, which are considered to be native speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to officially renounce Ukrainian citizenship, having provided for this purpose an appropriate application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
Refusal of "another's" citizenship, as now, will not be required, if it is stipulated by the international agreement or if it is impossible "due to reasons beyond the control of the person".
A corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among whom the first vice speaker of the State Duma Ivan Melnikov (Communist Party of the Russian Federation), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Airat Farrakhov (all - United Russia).
I think that many of you know that it is impossible to obtain a certificate from Ukraine, it is simply impossible.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for the decision of their fate about the citizenship of the Russian Federation, "Pavel Krasheninnikov (EP), head of the Duma committee on state construction and legislation, explained on the eve.
In addition, the text clarified that the restrictions on the employment of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who have written off the "other" citizenship and handed over the former passport to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, but "for reasons beyond his control" he was not considered a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are forbidden to occupy posts in the municipal service, to be hired for facilities and organizations whose activities are related to ensuring Russia's security.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country can not become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force on September 1, 2017, by that time the necessary by-laws must be ready.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in the "Hot American Summer" and "Tovarishche Detective"
The current iteration of history nostalgically resembles both the glorious days of the characters in the 80's, the grunge era in the 90s (around the time when the great masters David Wayne and Michael Shawalter made the comedy of the State sketches for MTV) and about herself-that is, 2001 before her stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd moved on to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is simultaneously the rise and the embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems an anachronism.
"The first day of the camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of absurdist humor (including the original story of a talking can of vegetables, voiced by John John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have just reached adulthood, due to this the inability to return to become part of the joke.
"Ten years later", where adults played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more haphazard and includes riffs from stalker films of the 90s such as "Hands cradling the cradle."
In one episode, the character gets an Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates and a "bunch of other things from 1991".
Many plot moves are the same.
The good-natured Kup (Showalter), now a writer, still has not achieved reciprocity from Cathy (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still did not part with virginity.
And then there's the insane and vile conspiracy in which Ronald Reagan (also Showalter) is involved, now incited by George HW Bush (a proven parody performed by Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the deviation from it.
It's especially funny to see the ever-young Rudd, who sings the song of Matt Dillon from The Loners, whose character, the former big man Andy, now looks like an old man.
To bring this franchise success could be occasional frenzy in the spirit of the type of the recursive series "Seven Up", until it reaches what I think would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American summer: twenty years later", where in the last scene the whole company would go to the cinema for the premiere of the movie "Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon refers to another type of nostalgia: memories of the Cold War from the "Americans", "Blasting Blonde" or even "Shine" with its images of the struggle of East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Riz Thomas, depicts a television movie: the Romanian police drama of the 80s about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist path.
The main roles - who saw the life of Gregor and the idealist Joseph - are performed by Florin Piersik Jr. and Corneliu Ulic, and their dialogues in English were chanted by Channing Tatum (who is also the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levit.
It's a brilliant idea.
But only an idea.
There are several visual jokes (police spend time watching a match in chess, how Americans could watch football).
The team of famous voice-overs - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - allows you to play "guess voice" interestingly.
But "Comrade Detective" is so clinging to the credibility of the awkward propaganda drama - there is even a killer in the mask of Ronald Reagan - that often looks like it.
Six long episodes are tightened, and it's funny not very often.
If it were done shorter, "Comrade Detective" could better cope with his satire in the spirit of agitprop, for example, every time Gregor and Josef come to the American embassy, in the lobby there are two fat people who absorb a bunch of hamburgers.
To the imaginary viewer-communist this image says that Western culture is capable of making obrygalovka from anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: We do this even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The prize fund of the match for the Russian Super Cup on football between Spartak and Lokomotiv will be about 30 million rubles.
This was announced by the president of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergei Pryadkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the Premier League, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, RT reports.
He also added that by the present moment there are almost no tickets for the match.
Match "Spartacus" - "Locomotive" will be held on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
As TASS notes, "Spartak" - the current champion of Russia, and "Locomotive" is the owner of the Cup of the country.
Two young Ufimtsev cleaned the furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
The other day, the police turned 37-year-old Ufa, who has a furniture company.
The man said about the theft of expensive tools from the shop, which caused serious damage to his production.
The production of thieves became tools worth almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, a puncher, hydraulics, a winch.
The guards began to search for the criminals and soon went out to the residents of Blagoveshchensky district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the republic, the accomplices infiltrated the territory of the enterprise, cracked the front door and took out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first car service.
In relation to them, a case has already been filed for theft, and the law enforcement officers managed to return only part of the stolen instruments to the rightful owner.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words about the relations between Russia and the United States
The US and Russia should be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by State Department spokesman Heather Nauert in response to the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on the relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared the Russian Federation a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on these words, Naouert admitted that Russian-American relations are at a "low level", but noted that it is necessary to look for "areas for interaction."
"Look at the truce in the south-west of Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the US and Russia," RIA Novosti quoted the diplomat as saying.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign ministry declined to comment on the Russian Prime Minister's statement that sanctions are tantamount to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea, US President Donald Trump signed on Wednesday.
At the same time, he admitted that the document is unsuccessful and contradicts the American Constitution.
Dior "grew" roses from amethyst and quartz
Jewelry unit of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has replenished the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
Five new rings appeared in them and three choker necklaces on velvet ribbons.
In the Rose Dior Pré Catelan line, two new rings and a pendant made of amethysts, rose quartz and diamonds, made in the technique of glyptic (hand carved in stone) and pavazh and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoire de Castellan was inspired by the roses that the fashion designer Christian Dior cultivated in her estate in Granville, and the Bagatelle and Pre-Catelanes parisian gardens.
Trump found the perpetrators of deteriorating relations with Russia
President of the United States Donald Trump criticized the members of the Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions led to the deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedentedly low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can not even give us medicine," the president wrote on Twitter.
On the eve of Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea.
In particular, they will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House issued a statement by the president, in which he indicated that the law would not allow the US to conclude beneficial deals and further bring Russia, China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian businessman refused to buy Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
An entrepreneur from Belarus Viktor Prokopenya withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC "to concentrate on our other planned investments and projects that we are working on."
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step will be "the best investment of time," despite the investment attractiveness of buying a daughter of Sberbank.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main contender for the purchase of a Russian bank in Ukraine after in July the NBU rejected the bid of the NorvikBank consortium Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Gutseriev.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after in March, President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries.
One of such financial organizations - and in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - was Sberbank.
Novak called the cause of blackout in the Crimea
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation named the cause of blackout in the Crimea.
The head of the department Alexander Novak made explanations about the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity because of the traffic accident on the territory of the Krasnodar Territory.
The truck caught in the road accident touched the transmission lines, as a result, the Kuban and associated Crimean networks disconnected.
Failures in the electricity supply of major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Experts have fixed the problem within a few hours.
It was initially reported that the cause of blackout could be an abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected that the Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation forced the rumors of a possible increase to subside.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain unhurried, and left interest rates unchanged amid growing pressure on household incomes.
The specialists of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank (MPC) voted with a result of 6 versus 2 for keeping rates at 0.25%, while this month a smaller number of committee members supported the rate increase because weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts for a 1.7% increase in interest rates in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes will continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to around 3% in autumn.
However, the bank warned that rate hikes in the next few years will be necessary to control inflation-induced inflation, and said that it is likely that borrowing costs will have to be raised more than expected in the financial markets.
Also, members of the committee voted to abandon part of the huge complex of measures to develop the economy, launched a year ago due to breksite.
Beginning next February, the bank will close the urgent financing plan, which provides banks with cheap loans, although he said that he now has to provide another 15 billion pounds under this plan - up to 115 billion pounds.
In the protocol on making the decision on the rates, the bank said: "According to MPC's main forecasts, the growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the near future remains slow, while the pressure on real household incomes continues to affect consumption."
On the issue of rates, he repeated that in order to stop inflation, it would take "some tightening of the financial policy", in a "somewhat larger" amount than the markets expect.
At the moment, the markets are predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all the increases will be "gradual" and "limited."
The bank's forecasts for an increase in this and the next year are lower than the forecasts made in May, which were 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank left its forecast unchanged at 1.8% in 2018.
After these news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent disappointing growth rates weakened the increased expectation of the increase, while GDP then grew by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth, apparently, will remain at the level of 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's last report on inflation gave little reason for the joy of households, which were hit by high inflation and very insignificant wage increases: according to the bank, the pressure will intensify before falling.
The bank added that the financial policy "can not prevent" a gain on earnings in the next few years, but expects salaries to "significantly" recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of the growing demand for British goods, due to the low pound rate, which compensates for a portion of the reduced consumer spending.
The decision was made one year after last August the rates were reduced to 0.25% after the shocking results of the referendum on the withdrawal from the European Union, which caused the pound to fall.
According to the estimates of the bank, most likely, it will take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last decision on rates, there was a growing buzz about the expected increase in rates, as inflation was increasingly pressured by already-pressure households: three specialists on the committee were asked to raise rates to 0.5% in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although, according to the bank, this fall was expected and in the coming months again compensated.
According to the bank, a higher rate compared to the planned 2% is entirely a consequence of the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Mortgage Brokers Coreco, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, it seems that the mortgage market will again become even more competitive, as lenders require business opportunities and expect a good year's end.
The market looks especially favorable for those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, since refinancing loans, often with the possibility of no commission, and with a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever. "
The public health service will prescribe a controversial drug from HIV 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a "revolutionary" drug for HIV prevention after the Battle of the High Court on funding the drug from the National Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that pre-exposure prevention of HIV (PREP), a tablet taken before sex, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in at-risk individuals by an average of 86 percent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year trial period to approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court ruling last year stating that the National Health Service has the ability to pay the PrEP, despite her statements that it should be funded by local authorities.
This step, which was announced on Thursday, was named "the most important innovation" by the president of the National Health Service of England Simon Stevens, and the National Office for the Control of AIDS Spread (NAT) called it "turning point".
Before the full launch of the program throughout England by April 2018, the venereological dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start registering people, and even more dispensaries will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of drugs from HIV taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
As studies have shown, PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
At reception PrEP before sex in an organism of the person sufficient quantity of the certain preparations to prevent infection with a HIV-infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or not later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible to receive the drug are homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensaries will select suitable participants who agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and those whose partners are not aware whether their HIV status is being held back by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereological dispensary participating in the program.
The program will cost 10 million pounds, and the National Health Service of England this week after an international procurement tender signed a drug security agreement.
The study is designed in such a way as to assess all the possibilities of PrEP by collecting clinical data about who is the target audience of the drug, its digestibility and application on a large scale.
"This major innovation should complement and strengthen large-scale and increasingly successful efforts aimed at preventing HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the biggest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National Office for the Control of AIDS Spending), said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if competently aimed at people who need help and are at risk, makes it possible to change the state of the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at risk for HIV, thanks to this research being conducted in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new means opening a new opportunity, which a person can control himself without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news. "
Jan Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "Now, first and foremost, we need to ensure that the trial quickly unfolds throughout the country, and that none of the risk groups for HIV are forgotten.
Now that we are provided with the experimental preparation of PrEP, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV. "
Shadow Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: "We very much welcome the start of the PrEP trial, it was very late because of months of delays and procrastination on the part of the government."
The data demonstrate how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us a step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that the test be deployed as soon as possible across the country to protect people at risk for HIV and to move us one step further to stop the spread of HIV in society.
The World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution on supporting the Tatarstan-Russian treaty
The Sixth Congress of the World Congress of Tatars (CGT) adopted a resolution in which he noted the importance of maintaining the post of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a positively recommended form of organization of the highest state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people."
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the treaty on the division of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole."
Recall that the July 24, 2007 agreement between Moscow and Kazan was signed for 10 years.
On July 11, the deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and keep the post of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation that has an agreement with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "president".
In Russia, there were difficulties in obtaining international driving licenses
The units of the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate are experiencing a deficit of international driving licenses (IDPs).
To get such rights, we have to wait a few weeks for the queue, which was a real problem for holidaymakers wishing to go abroad for a vacation in their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving permits remains controversial.
The IDP was introduced in order to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what is written in the national identity card, since the information is explained in five languages.
Requirements for international rights are recorded in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, 1968, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized.
However, in reality it all depends on the specific police or rental office: some require the IDP, and someone has enough national rights.
To insure, drivers still get international rights, but it should be taken into account that in countries that have not ratified the convention (for example, the USA, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia), the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or IDPs.
Now there is a problem with forms in almost all units of the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate, Kommersant reports, having conducted a survey in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow in the divisions of UGIBDD, coupons are simply not issued, there are not enough forms for four months already.
You can make an appointment at the website of state services, but there the queue has already stretched to the middle of August.
In Krasnoyarsk, the IDP can not be obtained "for technical reasons", without going into details, in the Samara region it is honestly said that there are no forms, a similar situation develops in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, in social networks, such reports are increasingly appearing:
Irina Burmistrova: "Guess why Moscow can not get international rights?"
That's right, because in all the departments of the traffic police ran out forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "The question to knowledgeable people!"
It is necessary to obtain international rights very urgently.
In Moscow, all the time is scored far ahead, in place of the coupons do not give out (there is a button, but the ticket can not give).
It seems that the portal of state services shows that in St. Petersburg time free to fig.
Did anyone try to get in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for forms of international driving permits have changed, that is why new forms are delivered to the units of the State Automobile Inspection.
With this, and may be associated with a deficit, it is true, it is not clear what changes are being discussed, earlier this was not reported.
Blanks is purchased by the Special Purpose Center in the field of road safety (CSN BDD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then delivers them to the traffic police.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with JSC Goznak: in 2014-2015 almost 200 thousand forms of IDPs were manufactured, in 2016 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with OOO First Printing Yard to produce 70,000 forms.
There is a version that the CSN simply did not have time to hold a tender, because of which there was a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to travel independently to Europe, and to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are taken there, it is not clear until the end, that's why people are reinsured, that's why the demand for international "crusts" arose.
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to take an exam to confirm their qualifications.
The Ministry of Transport came up with this proposal.
International driver's license (IDP) of a new model is valid from May 31, 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
Minister of Justice of Ukraine Pavel Petrenko said that he does not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge to the Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he said this in an interview with Obozrevatel.
No self-respecting international company even puts a bolt or nut on it, because it risks losing its business on the territory of the EU, the US, Japan - in countries that have joined sanctions against Russia regarding the Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, there is practically no prospect for this project," Petrenko said.
He added that he considers Russia incapable of implementing a major infrastructure project independently.
Russia can not normally build smaller facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, entire stadiums have already begun to collapse.
"Therefore, I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that turned out to be so short-sighted to join this project," the official said.
July 31 builders completed the construction of the arch of the automobile arch of the Crimean bridge.
On the Kerch coast, an enlarged assembly of the road bridge of the Crimean bridge is completed: its arch is closed at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"Simultaneously, bridge builders prepared to install a railway arch on the fairways," the information center of the project reported.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport, Maxim Sokolov, informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility is ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean peninsula and the Krasnodar Territory.
In Spain, fired an official who 10 years did not go to work
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to the civil service) was supposed to have the head of the Spanish official Carles Recio?
The permanent absenteeism lasted 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was still fired.
But not his immediate boss.
What does not happen in the world of bureaucrats?
The townsfolk, it seems, have long been accustomed to all the pranks of "servants of the people."
And, nevertheless, officials all the time manage to surprise those, whose taxes they live well.
This time the "sensation" came from Spain.
There an employee of the archives of Valencia Carles Recio has managed for a whole ten years not to go to work.
At the same time, he regularly received a salary.
And all the solid - 50 thousand euros per year.
And the "wonderful times" of Mr. Recio ended.
He was fired by the decision of the legislative assembly of Valencia.
During the investigation it was found out that the malicious junket every business morning came to the office at 07:00 to mark the electronic system.
And then he went home.
Once again he appeared on the workplace at 4:00 pm, to again note in the system that he had left.
And so 10 years.
It also became known that all the free time the junkie devoted to drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia think how to punish the immediate boss of Mr. Recio, who could not help but know how to "actively work" in his workplace, his subordinate.
Judges are offered protection from the chairmen
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes to limit the powers of the chairmen of the courts and introduce their electivity.
For courts of appeal and cassation instances, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also present its proposals within the framework of the presidential mandate.
The HRO has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was conducted by the HRO on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the president gave after meeting with council members.
At a meeting with members of the council on December 8, 2016, some cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens were discussed (see "Kommersant" on December 9).
The result of the work of the HRO was 25 proposals, which concern both issues of ensuring the independence of judges and identifying judicial errors, as well as financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin's human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the chairmen of courts to enhance the independence of the remaining judges.
If the candidate for the position of a judge has successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judiciary, the chairman of the court, according to the HRO, should present him to the appointment, not having the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed to deprive the president of the right to distribute cases between judges.
Do it, experts say, can be a specially written computer program.
The HRC also believes that the chairman has no right "to predetermine the results of the judge's qualification, initiate his involvement in disciplinary proceedings, and make decisions on the establishment of additional material benefits."
At the same time, the presidential council considers it necessary to move to "the election of the chairmen of the courts by the judges themselves" and "grant them powers for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation."
Now all chairmen of courts (from republican to district) are appointed for six years by the president on the proposal of the chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
To protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HRO proposes to organize a new appeal and cassation in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRO says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts."
Experts take as a basis the practice of arbitration courts.
With them, there are "judicial districts" that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guarantee greater independence from regional officials due to this, which makes use of "telephone law" difficult.
The HRO proposes that the world judges be strengthened by people's assessors in order to consider with their participation certain "categories of civil and administrative cases."
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honor and dignity, the deprivation of a driver's license, etc.
"These are only our proposals," the member of the HRO, judge of the Constitutional Court, retired Tamara Morshchakova, explained to Kommersant.
She also recalled that the president's assignment applied not only to the HRO, but also to the Supreme Court (Supreme Court), which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
The time for fulfilling the commission from the Armed Forces (among the co-executors is the Prosecutor General's Office and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation) there is still.
Reporting to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation, Vyacheslav Lebedev, chairman of the Armed Forces, is due before September 1.
To live a high life: a half-story and cunning design techniques turned this little apartment into Earls Court into a spacious dwelling
Joanne Lee, a former banker interested in real estate repairs, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge in 2014 to an apartment in Earls Court.
The apartment is located on the first floor of a nice model house in the style of Queen Anne, and in favor of the new design says that Joan did not pick up her things and moved again.
"I used to live with my ex-Knightsbridge in a much larger area," Joan says.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and here were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered a price on the same day. "
Since the first viewing, an apartment of 1,000 square feet has undergone a complete renovation.
Originally it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a semi-floor to get the most out of the generous height of the ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
Those were my requirements, "she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed, located in Notting Hill, to use 12.5-foot-high ceilings and create a dwelling that would not only be a successful project, but would be suitable for Joan's life.
The ceiling was not high enough to arrange two rooms one above the other, so the architectural task was to create a semi-floor, where you could stand in full growth.
Erfan had to think creatively to cope with the brief.
"Working with steel structures is very difficult," he explains.
"We needed to arrange the rooms so that they were one above the other, and did not have to bend.
It was necessary not just to build a simple platform, but to bend the structures so that they were at the right height and allowed to use the rooms from above and from below. "
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-sized rooms one above the other in the allotted space - and many more interesting.
From the half-story through the vintage copper light window from the "Retrouvius" you can see the chic living room below.
Mirror furniture with golden trim, silver accents and vintage lighting from Serge Mui set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding entertainment, space and light.
A short corridor is framed by mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored security panel seems to be a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirrored cabinets serve to store all the dishes of Joan.
To create a feeling of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can block the kitchen when not in use.
In the folding kitchens there is nothing new.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a sliding door, like in a garage.
"Engineering was involved here," Erfan says of the steel-reinforced wood-panel panel door.
"It's equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the intelligent use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"In the end, the floor area is exactly what you will sell, that is, what your real estate is valued," Erfan says.
"Roughly speaking, a real estate agent will enter and make calculations based on the floor area."
Here they were able to increase the floor area using quality materials that give the space a touch of luxury.
"Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional bond with the house," Erfan says.
"Nobody falls in love with the electrical wiring in the walls.
It is important, but it does not affect the strings of our hearts. "
This is a testament to the fact that due to good design and increased footage, the apartment can turn from something ordinary into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The government approved the creation of a commission on cultural policy
The Russian government approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The relevant resolution is published on the government website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be the development and adjustment of strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The commission will also develop draft strategies for cultural policy, clarify tasks and prepare new programs for its implementation.
The head of the commission was appointed Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in 2016 approved a plan for implementing the strategy of state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 events and provides for measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and it will also help create conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in the G20 countries decreased to an eight-year low
The growth in consumer prices in the G20 countries has fallen to the lowest values over the past eight years, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation in June 2016 was 2% - lower values were observed in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier Rosstat reported a decrease in Russia's consumer price index by 0.1%.
Thus, the agency fixed the first in 2017, a week of deflation.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been reached - according to the agency's version, the figure is 4%.
Putin warned against illegal cutting of the Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against illegal destruction of forests during the meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baikal territory.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoi noted that a draft law had been prepared earlier.
He permits logging during the liquidation of fires, and the government plans to take it in the fall.
In turn, the president said that this project should be monitored so that in the process of cutting down "everything is not cut down".
Donskoy noted that this draft law implies control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and supervisory agencies.
Media: fighters of the Armed Forces secretly agree with the militia of the Donbass
On the line of armed confrontation in the Donbass regular telephone communication is established.
Fighters of the warring parties constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is not known at headquarters.
The fighters of the APU and the militia of the Donbass have established communication on cell phones secretly from their high command.
This August 4, reports "Country." With reference to the participants of the military operation in the Donbass.
According to the newspaper, commanders of the units perfectly know the names of their colleagues from the opposite side of the front and communicate with them on a daily basis by phones.
Communication is not at all common: commanders are trying to achieve certain "tactical agreements".
Often the result of such conversations is a truce on a certain section of the front.
Journalists became aware of the cases when one or another officer received congratulations on his birthday from behind the front line, from his formal enemy.
The soldiers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and militiamen of the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Germany are sitting in the trenches on the line of demarcation since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a military operation against the Donbas.
Foreign Ministry outraged the blocking of UN Security Council statements about attacks on the Russian embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives, who block UN Security Council statements in the press, condemning the terrorist bombardment of the Russian embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The department was reminded that on August 2, the territory of the Russian embassy in Damascus was subjected to mortar fire from terrorist groups of the Heyat Tahrir Ash Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, banned in Russia) and Faylak Ar-Rahman for the third time in a month.
Considering that the international community is unanimous in the qualification of Nusra as a terrorist organization and the UN Security Council resolutions call for counteraction to this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem, it goes without saying that the Nusra acts of terrorism must meet unanimous and decisive condemnation, and there should be no ambiguity in assessing the attacks against diplomatic missions."
However, as stressed in the diplomatic mission, "for the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately, varying the tone of the objections, hiding behind the arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the Russian Federation's proposal to adopt a standard short draft of the Security Council statement for the press, condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital."
Unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us, let them remain on the conscience of these delegations.
"The most disturbing thing is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and acts of terrorism, makes them feel impunity," the Foreign Ministry said and added that "we would not like these barbarians to have the conviction that someone in the Security Council is with them at the same time."
Vladimir Putin spoke in favor of limiting the number of unscheduled inspections of business
Russian President Vladimir Putin said during the meeting on investment projects in the Far East that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the planned number, and also said that it is necessary to limit the period of inspections for ten days.
"Unplanned inspections are carried out, as a rule, without proper coordination with the prosecutor's office, only 2-3% are agreed with the prosecutor's office, everything else goes on their own," the TASS president said.
Vladimir Putin also said that it is necessary to prohibit investigators from seizing servers and hard drives at enterprises.
In addition, according to the president, business associations should get the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"This, I hope, will bring a certain positive to the consideration of cases related to business activities, or related to the violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
As reported by "Kommersant", because of the moratorium on the conduct of planned inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is growing.
In May, according to the request of the business ombudsman under Russian President Boris Titov, a survey was carried out. As a result, it was found out that in fact the planned inspections were replaced by unscheduled inspections (the proportion of those who faced them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raid (from 7.9% to 13.3%), and citizens' applications (from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative investigations (10.8% to 15.5%).
More details about business checks in the "Kommersant" material "To small business came from the other side."
Brothers are fighting for an empire of real estate worth more than $ 500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest in the state of Victoria empires in the real estate trade worth more than $ 500 million - forty years after their Italian ancestors founded a dynasty.
Former director of the Carlton football club and developer Colin de Lutis lives in the palace of Turak three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a lawsuit against him on the division of possessions and assets against the Supreme Court.
Paul wants to leave the family business in 2014, but in the Supreme Court there is still a fierce dispute over the terms of the divorce.
Together with his mother Anna, the brothers own 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars, bought since when in 1973 their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood.
There, the family founded the firm "Westco Jeans", which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million dollars.
The money was invested in real estate, and the list of possessions of the De Lutis family includes today office buildings, plots for building in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mount Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
By agreement with the late father Colin - whom Paul describes as "the main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul - about one-third.
According to the court this means that Kolin's property is 316 million, and Paul's 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings took place in the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - from which, according to Paul, Colin expelled him.
Colin argues that this is not so, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of certain objects.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the trial, he said that he hoped to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me regard the family as the highest priority," he wrote.
Court expenses are growing like a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimonies, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are attached to the case, both sides have attracted the most famous lawyers, including the royal lawyer Allan Myers, and the best solicitors.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy, from the late 1950s they ran dairy bars and grocery stores, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, in which Colin opened the first family store of jeans.
Colin says that he ran Westco when he was "in the last grade at school, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their possessions to their sons without conflict.
"Luigi often told me that he does not want the brothers to understand the court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, Colin says that Mark received 10 million when he left the business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "unhappy with the financial conditions of their office."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to Eddie McGuire's biography published in 2015, is the television star's best friend.
"Fairfax Media" on Friday contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
Colin answered only, with a text message, in which it was said that since the case had not yet been examined in court, "I really have nothing to say."
"I very, very much regret that my brother Paul decided to file a lawsuit against me and beat the name of our family in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in testimony that he was trying to meet the demands of his brother.
"Our father would not like to see how we argue with Paul in court," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution to the conflict."
On Friday, this hope seems to have dissipated.
"The decision on our case will soon be rendered by the court," Colin wrote.
The new head of the Trump office plans to limit the flow of information to the president.
Others tried to do this and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly will really succeed.
In that case, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new head of the White House's administration plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media, hoping to keep the chief in a more relaxed state.
That's what reporter Josh Dowzi says.
"At a meeting held by the new head of the White House staff, John F. Kelly, with the leadership of the apparatus on his first working day, he outlined the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: poor channels of information flow to the president."
Kelly told staff that information should pass through him - in paper form or through briefings - because the president would be better at making decisions if he gets the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is absolutely correct, but others have already failed, trying to pacify Trump by tracking the information he receives.
President Trump's relationship with television emerged decades ago - and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, being a candidate, was indignant at the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he received fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded," Sam Nanberg, a former adviser to the election headquarters, said in February.
Tara Palmeri then wrote to Politico that "in the words of six former members of the electoral headquarters, in order to keep Trump's habit of writing on Twitter, it was necessary to ensure that there is a constant flow of praise in the information that comes to him personally."
Good.
But the idea that Trump's habit of writing to Twitter has ever been "under control" is simply ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the electoral staff know something that we do not know - for example, that if it were not for them, Trump's tweets would have been even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets that Trump did not publish.
If his employees saved him from trouble at least several times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one could always keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to push their agenda by giving Trump a material - reliable or not - that confirms their views.
"Politico" - just in time for this story - wrote in May about the propensity of advisers to constantly poke dubious information on the president.
Here is one example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Trump's current and former employees say that Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous information leaks, and will not rest until he finds out who was behind them.
This happened in late February, when someone slipped the printout of the article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, in which the deputy head of the apparatus Katie Welch was accused of "standing behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
It does not matter that Johnson is forever banned on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he did not submit concrete facts or that in the past he launched false accusations and then refused them.
Trump read the article and began to question the staff about Welch. "
Goldmacher adds that the then head of the apparatus Rines Pribus and the secretary of the staff Rob Porter "tried to build a system to control the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them."
How did it work?
Three months later Kelly tries to do the same.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature, and his assistants still fight with each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen prosecutor's office struggles with HIV-dissident
The prosecutor's office challenged the ruling of the Kalininsky district court of Tyumen, which stopped the criminal case against a local woman who died from HIV from her young daughter.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother is a HIV-dissident and refused to receive treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility in connection with reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecutor's office believes that the crime can not be left unpunished, so as not to set a precedent for other HIV-dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tyumen was initiated under part 1 of Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (causing death by negligence) in April, after her three-year-old daughter died from HIV infection at stage 4.
According to the prosecutor's office, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
"The woman was not treated herself and refused treatment of her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist," the prosecutor's office in the Tyumen region explained.
The criminal case was filed with the Kalininsky District Court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
The petition was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that she "forgave his wife, has no claims to her, she has made amends and apologized."
The prosecutor's office did not agree with the court's decision and appealed, demanding that the decision to terminate the case be canceled and sent to a new trial.
The girl died, and it is impossible to make amends for the damage caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her from a dangerous infection, "the press service of the prosecutor's office said.
According to the supervisory authority, she should be punished, otherwise her example will be followed by other HIV-dissidents.
As reported in the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region, about 12 children with HIV are not receiving medical care because of the parents' refusal.
"And this situation has already improved - during the year of the special group's work, half of parents who categorically refused to treat children from HIV changed their minds - they allowed to diagnose and began taking drugs," said Elena Loseva, spokeswoman for the AIDS Center.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents in a legislative way, and as a result not all HIV-infected children can be found out - mothers do not allow them to examine, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
What is the danger of HIV-dissidents?
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first in Russia study of the so-called movement of HIV-dissidents.
HIV-dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medicine.
Physicians and activists of AIDS service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and in their dissemination see a serious threat.
A terrible photo session that ended in tragedy occurred on Thursday, August 3, at the Greceani railway station in Khmelnitsky.
A cheerful company of drunken young people was walking the bridge over the railway tracks, where just a freight train was standing.
One of the friends had an idea to make a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, told "FACTAM" in the police communications sector in the Khmelnytsky region.
The guy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but because of his imprudence caught on the power line and immediately received an electric shock.
Fortunately, this case was made known to the dispatcher of the station, who immediately called "ambulance".
Before the doctors arrived, the victim was transferred to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of the Khmelnitsky regional clinical hospital.
A man was diagnosed with torso burns of 1-2 degrees.
Now doctors assess his condition as stable.
Law enforcers recall that in recent years, increasing popularity is gaining extreme selfies on the roofs of high-rise buildings, bridges, and moving transport.
The police urges people to be vigilant and prevent such photo shoots, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists admitted the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
On the ancient Venus there could be oceans.
This assumption was made by French scientists.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that on the Venus at the beginning of its history formed the oceans, which had 10% more water than now on Earth.
Earlier, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean 4 billion years ago could have existed on Mars.
Foreign experts in the course of their studies came to the conclusion that the water body was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.

rock band Louna to present new album in Barnaul
Concert of rock band Louna will be held in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album "Brave New World", which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The team is preparing a conceptual show, which will be the brightest in the band's concert history.
"Brave New World" is the fourth album of the Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is associated with the famous anti-utopia novel O. Haxley "Oh Brave New World."
New songs do not retell the book, but talk about a society that lives by the law of anti-utopia, "blindly believing propaganda and imposed values."
The listeners helped to collect money for recording the album: on the site of "Planeta.Ru" the project was supported by more than 1200 people.
His first album "Do it Loud!" Louna released in 2010.
Two years later the musicians presented the record "Time X", and in 2013 they recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, the Louna band performed with the symphony orchestra at the Crocus City Hall with the program Songs of Peace.
As part of the group Lusine Gevorgyan (vocals), Vitaly Demidenko (bass guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergei Ponkratiev (guitar), Leonid Kinzbursky (drums).
The concert will be held in Barnaul club "Pharaoh" on October 17 at 19.00.
The price of tickets: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the most sought-after bands on the Russian rock scene.
The team was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The group won several times in different categories of the hit parade "Fucking Dozen."
Gypsies overcame the moat and returned to the "street of millionaires"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are again in conflict with the determined gypsies who overcame the moat dug by the municipal authorities to re-occupy the field next to their homes.
Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich street of Solihulla, which was jokingly called the "street of millionaires."
Having brought horses, babies and a number of houses on wheels, they returned after they were expelled no further than in May, and they did not interfere with the moat dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactful company found a gap in the defensive structures and squeezed its vehicles through the site, which was left unguarded to leave a place for the path.
Enraged residents attacked the municipality of Solihulla, saying that he was "incapable of solving this problem."
An anonymous local resident reported: "They arrived here on Monday evening, after they were driven out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by."
The municipality should be shamed and forced to act, because they are completely unable to solve this problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were driven away, and they returned again.
Last night came even more gypsies, and today, perhaps even more.
"The Municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they receive long-term judicial orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Streetbrook Road, and I do not like that I continue to pay municipal tax, and the municipality can not even put an end to it. "
One local resident, who asked to remain anonymous, said: "It's funny, we just saw how these gypsies leave the previous time, and, please, this attack continues."
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse grazing on the meadow. "
A spokesman for Solihulla said: "We know about the illegal camp on the ground near Stritsbrook Road and we cooperate with the Solihull police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to get them out as soon as possible."
To help us collect evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible can report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police at 101.
This allows us to get an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we submit our case to them.
Crimea shares the plant of champagne wines "New World"
State Unitary Enterprise of the Republic of Crimea "The plant of champagne wines" New World "" it was decided to share, transforming into OJSC "Champagne Wine Factory" Novy Svet ", follows from the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anyukhina.
100% of the shares of the company will remain in the state property of the Crimea.
The authorized capital of the joint-stock company will be 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5.955 million ordinary shares with a par value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if within the next three years there are no funds for the modernization of the enterprise, then there will be a threat of plant shutdown.
Depreciation of fixed assets in the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion rubles, due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to budget revenue.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"It is difficult to get money from the owner, it's difficult to talk about raising borrowed funds of large credit organizations," said Deputy Head of the Crimean Ministry of Agriculture Sergey Petelin in April this year.
Parliament of Crimea included the enterprise in the forecast plan of privatization for 2017.
It was proposed to conduct its corporatization and put it up for auction.
The source of Interfax in the Crimean authorities estimated the possible cost of selling the enterprise at $ 40 million, investing the investor in modernization - another $ 30 million.
"New World" in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to 2015 - up to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the "New World" intended to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was founded in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn as a factory for the production of sparkling wine in the acquired estate of the New World.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
The Nizhny Novgorod third class defeated more than 40 tombstones
Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Nizhny Novgorod region established the identity of citizens who destroyed 46 tombstones in the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
Attackers were students of the third class.
The first statement that the gravestones were damaged by unknown persons was received by the RF MIA of Russia in the Lyskovsky district on June 27.
In total, 24 people applied to the police.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Destruction, Damage or Desecration of Burial Places".
As a result of the investigation, the police found the suspects, they were two schoolchildren at the age of 8 and 9 years.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested to see how the monuments fall, and this prompted them to hooliganism.
Preventive measures were carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone towards the ships of NGOs that save migrants.
Italy warned NGOs that owned rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue working unless they complied with the new rules governing their activities.
"If the NGO does not submit to the new code of conduct, it's hard to say whether they can continue their activities," Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily Stampa.
Minniti's warning was made the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion that his crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which worked for only a year, declined to comment on the merits of the detailed charges brought against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartozio.
"For us, the salvation of human life is and will remain the highest priority, therefore we are very sorry that we can not continue our activity in the search and rescue zone now," the organization's statement says in social networks.
"We will be able to assess all the charges brought forward now, only after we collect all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities are following the vessel Juventa, owned by Jugend Rettet, since October.
His crew is suspected of taking whole lifeboats aboard migrants whom traffickers sent directly to them, and allowing smugglers to leave with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting is supposed to take place just 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the materials of the prosecution, the contents of which were published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the orders of the Italian coastal authorities, which control the rescue operations in this zone, rather from humanitarian zeal, than for any other reasons.
The code of conduct presupposes, mainly, that the Juventa type ships will have an Italian police officer on board who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to obey the code: "Save the Children", the Maltese MOAS and "Pro-Activa Spread Embrace" from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considers the new rules to be unnecessary, but acceptable, provided that they do not entail any "significant changes or interference" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors bear fruit.
"In recent days we started to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He reported on plans for further talks with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with either side of the conflict"
The authorities of the Russian Federation have recently stepped up their policy in the Libyan direction, while delegations from the opposing Libyan parties were frequenting visits to Moscow.
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Libyan settlement at the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma, an assistant to the head of the Chechen republic, Lev Dengov, told Kommersant what goals Moscow pursues in this region and on whom it stakes.
About the contact group for Libya, which you are heading, almost nothing is known.
Here, for example, the contact group for Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here is the veil of secrecy.
What exactly do you do, what goals do you pursue?
Contact group was established on the initiative of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Duma deputy from Chechnya - "Kommersant").
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the formation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanic Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board - "b").
We thought about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group was created from military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.
And how did it happen that it was you who led it?
Since I've been working for Libya since 2008, I was asked to lead the work of the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from the Chebotarev Mechanics.
We managed to establish contacts with representatives of all the main groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and from Tripoli (where the UN-led government headed by Faiz Saraj is based) and Tobruk (the residence of the parliament, which opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya).
Thanks to the active participation of Akhmed Metig (Deputy Prime Minister of Libya - "Kommersant"), we managed to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, and dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I want to emphasize: in Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict, we are in dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are constantly in Libya?
Now the contact group includes five people.
Among them there are people who have experience in the power structures, including the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to introduce a group of specialists in the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
No one is permanently in Libya from our employees, there is no need for this yet.
Is there now in Libya Russian military advisers, instructors.
And if so, on which side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this do not correspond to reality.
But your contact group includes former military ...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or such closed cities as Misurata (where militia units are based, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and which became noticeably more active in the coming years, are based on "M").
We arrived in Misurata in January this year.
We were frightened, they said that there were all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there ourselves, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why such rumors go, what is really the role of Islamists there.
In Misurata, we met with all the representatives of the detachments that were engaged in the destruction of the IG in Sirte (in December 2016 this city on the Mediterranean coast was repelled from the militants of the banned "Islamic State" in Russia).
We wanted to see them, get to know these people, check the information that they played the decisive role in destroying the IG in Libya, and not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits to himself.
And to what conclusion did you come?
"The Islamic state" in Libya won not Haftar?
It was not he who did it.
Haftar conducted operations on a different front, in Benghazi.
And with the IG in Sirte, the structures that were subordinate to the government in Tripoli were fighting.
And by the way, we invited people to Russia who conducted this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from April 19 to 23 this year, the Libyan delegation was received by the Federation Council, the Duma, the Foreign Ministry and Rosgvardia.
You, as we understand, are in all Libyan regions and probably imagine the mood of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections that Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj achieved in Paris in late July?
Or again, as has happened many times in the past, the agreements will be disrupted, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to seize power solely?
For us, a good signal was the fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to the next meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders have spoken extremely negatively about each other.
And as for the position of Russia ...
Often they write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe it.
We were faced with this situation when we were in Misurata, and Haftar was on this day on board the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurata they did not believe in coincidence.
We were told: "You, probably, are very brave people, that you came to us just today."
But our task is just to show: we do not support only Haftar, we are in dialogue with all the key participants in the conflict in Libya.
You communicate with Haftar.
Does mutual understanding with Russian partners facilitate the fact that he studied twice in the USSR on a human, emotional level?
And, by the way, does Haftar know the Russian language?
Russian, if he does, he is very relative.
But the fact that he studied with us, of course, facilitates a dialogue with him.
And by the way not only with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misurata, we meet generals who studied either in Russia or else in the Soviet Union.
And now they perfectly speak Russian.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent they feel nostalgia for it.
Do you think that the imminent lifting of the arms embargo imposed on Libya is likely?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I said, we do not occupy someone's side in this conflict and do not want to arm one to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be in approximately equal positions.
As for the arms embargo, there are always calls from the Libyans that Russia somehow contribute to its lifting.
Now in Libya, the process of drafting the constitution is actively promoted.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions, achieve an internal consensus.
Then elections must take place, as discussed at the meeting of Saraj and Haftar.
If the elections are held and the legitimate authority is finally elected (and now neither side has such a status), then it is possible to raise the issue of lifting the arms embargo in the UN Security Council.
To raise this issue is now meaningless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees floating from Libya, feels abandoned to the mercy of fate by EU allies.
Can Moscow in this situation help Italian partners, using their connections with the Libyans?
How much, for example, is the realistic option that Haftar detachments will establish control over the coast and put an end to the smuggling business of smuggling immigrants to Europe?
Very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need Russia's support, because Moscow conducts a dialogue simultaneously with Haftar, and with Saraj, and with Misurata and the south of the country.
And in this matter the tribes in the south of Libya play an important role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
We are talking about the fact that the southerners stopped the flows of migrants on distant approaches?
That is, relatively speaking, deployed back buses, in which Nigerian migrants are traveling?
We achieve this.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these streams going.
We hope to help to unite the southerners in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But first we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of Sharia in the country.
How much of a radical opinion does he hold?
Will this not be an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I will express my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But the Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself adheres to the position that Libya should be absolutely normal country - moderately Islamic, open world.
And he is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where did he get such a reputation?
It was created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, there is legislative, executive and judicial power.
There the national oil corporation, the national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in that we did not go there.
And we mixed all the maps and began to actively communicate with Tripoli, and with Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has entered into an agreement on cooperation with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
Director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin made a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I believe that reselling.
And what are the economic interests of Russia in Libya?
The plans to re-sign the contracts concluded under Muammar Gaddafi.
This includes, in particular, previous agreements in the transport sector (construction of railways), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
And the Libyans have something to pay?
Well, they also have oil.
That is, as in the case of Iran, it is a question of the "oil-for-services" scheme?
I do not know what the scheme will be, I do not deal with these issues directly.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We are, in fact, engaged in peacekeeping work.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, help the Libyans to agree among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya ceases to be a conducive environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task - to help the Libyan people and extort terrorists from there.
Do you have information about the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that today there are not a single immigrant from Russia and other countries of the former USSR.
He said that he has about 50 thousand telephone conversations of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya - "Kommersant") and Russian speech does not sound there.
And from what states then these insurgents?
I would not want to go into these details.
Then we formulate the question differently.
How many of the Libyan militant Islamists in Libya?
There are practically no Libyans among them, they are not more than 5%.
The rest are alien.
Can Moscow conduct an intra-Libyan negotiations following the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are conducting active negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and declared their readiness to come again - to Moscow or to Grozny.
And when can such negotiations take place?
Now it's hard to say.
There are still several visits, and then, I hope, there will be clarity about the time and place of the talks.
In the Chekhov Museum philanthropists collected money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Matsola, who has cerebral palsy, brain hydrocephalus and complete blindness, will receive a specialized running track as a gift on August 5 at the Melikhovo Museum Preserve near Moscow.
The Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region Oksana Kosareva and the museum director Konstantin Bobkov will give a useful present to Sasha.
The money for the simulator was collected during the charity marathon "Do not be tired of doing good," which was held in Melikhovo on July 15 on Chekhov's Memorial Day.
On the eve of the marathon in the museum they received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino, Chekhov district, "I have no eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I would very much like to receive a treadmill as a gift, so that my legs will become strong, and I would have learned to walk a little."
And Sasha's dream came true!
After the presentation, the Concert-Postscript will take place in the museum-preserve. A well-known pianist, Honored Artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform a potpourri from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melikhov, the choir of the Ascension Davydova Desert, the bell ringers of the Ilya Drozdikhin workshop, the students of the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory and the Gnesins Russian Academy, the artists of the Melikhovsky Theater "Chekhov Studio" performed.
For visitors auctions were held, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenirs with the marathon logo were organized.
The Museum-Reserve Melikhovo made an initiative to make the Chekhov Memorial Day on July 15 a single day of charity in all the museums of the Moscow region.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk in the Zhytomyr region, near the local football stadium, shot several times toward the adolescents who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, told "FACTAM" in the communication department of the police in Zhytomyr region.
After that, the man went to a cafe, located nearby.
In the building he had a conflict, during which the man used a device for shooting rubber bullets, injuring one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim received the necessary medical assistance, there is no threat to his life.
Police and ambulance arrived at the scene, but the shooter disappeared by this time.
Law enforcers established his identity and detained the same day, on August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He has seized a device for shooting rubber bullets, which is sent for examination.
On this fact, a criminal proceeding under Article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine was launched.
The detainee faces imprisonment for a term of 3 to 7 years.
Recall that in Kiev on Lukyanovka in the area of Tatarskaya Street on the night of July 28 there was an attack with shooting.
The verdict of Michel Carter for the messages that led to the suicide of Conrad Roy
A resident of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for using her text messages and phone calls to encourage the suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michel Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months of his time in jail and another 5 years of probation.
Carter in June was found guilty of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at a hearing on Thursday: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain at large until the appeal.
She threatened a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers said that she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, hands clasped and eyes lowered.
"By her actions, she killed Konrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her.
She did not admit responsibility, "she said.
"She did not show remorse."
But attorney Carter said that it was "a tragic case, of which she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his opinion, her "age, level of maturity or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions."
The prosecutor read the statements of the mother of Roy Lynn Roy, which says: "not a single day passed when I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I manage it - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever, "it says.
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said that she was persistently pursued by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his aunt's children.
"To lose the person who has been with me always since my birth is a pain that will remain with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case is likely to become a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that would provide for the responsibility for counseling a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in the car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case drew the attention of the whole country when it became known that he had been pushed to the suicide of the message of Carter.
"You can hang yourself, jump from the roof, I do not know how to stab myself with a knife, there are many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before suicide she wrote: "You must do this, Conrad" and "You only need to turn on the ignition, and you will be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to get attention with the help of Roy's death, and forbade her to communicate with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The opinions of lawyers on this issue were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for murdering her British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
The 30-year-old Knox published her own opinion in the Los Angeles Times, stating: "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Yevgeny Bogachev: "I dismissed Langford as a high-flying bird"
One of the best basketball players of the VTB United League, 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNICS.
The departure of the American defender to Izvestia was commented on by the president of UNICS Evgeny Bogachev.
Keith took this decision for family reasons, - said Yevgeny Bogachev.
He has a small child, his wife, who did not want to move to Kazan.
Kit wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go to meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved another relationship.
He played three seasons in UNICS and showed a high level in every match, laid out for 100%.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and playing career.

In the season-2016/17 he was awarded the most successful player of the Euroleague season.
He scored 21.75 points on average per match.
This result is the second since 2004, when this award was established.

In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with the Chinese "Shenzhen", informs Eurohoops.
It is expected that the American will conclude a 2-year contract worth $ 5 million.
Langford will be the second in July Euroleague star, which goes to the Chinese championship.

Audi has to modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before the announcement from Audi, BMW said that they would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 cars.
The chairman of BMW said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent ways than restrictions on driving", referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - that have considered the possibility to prohibit or restrict the use of diesel cars.
"Daimler" said on Thursday that it is modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies called their step a recall.
European automakers actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to help comply with the rules for the release of carbon dioxide.
But the oxides of nitrogen that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automakers installing equipment that neutralizes the exhaust gases of diesel vehicles is also increasing, and maintaining a competitive price for cars becomes difficult.
While German automakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of indulging influential automakers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying not to repeat the mistakes of Volkswagen, which concealed the use of so-called "destruction devices", which during the testing could correct the amount of harmful gases being emitted in order to comply with the rules, and under normal driving conditions they were disconnected.
In the United States, several Volkswagen executives were convicted, while the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany, the former head of the department of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development group was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccio Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and can be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi fell under a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing the system to circumvent the European emission rules and expanded the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation can create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of luxury cars is the source of a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen's income.
In Astrakhan, a visitor to a cafe paid off with false money
The police received a message from the employee of the bank's branch about the discovery of suspicious banknotes in denominations of 5 thousand rubles during the recalculation of funds received from the point of public catering.
A study in the Forensic Center showed that it was fake.
As reported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia for the Astrakhan region, one of the visitors of the cafe, who bought shawarma, paid the banknote.
It is worth noting that the cashier was not equipped with a device for determining the authenticity of the notes.
Currently, policemen are identified persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a knowingly counterfeit ticket to the Central Bank of Russia.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs urges residents of the Astrakhan region to be attentive in the performance of financial transactions, it is recommended that employees of trade objects install devices to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found a "hellish" planet on which even iron can melt
First studying the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were much surprised by its temperature, which is able to vaporize iron and other metals.
Specialists drew attention to the fact that the water molecules are so warmed by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope captured the radiance of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the atmosphere of the planet to glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot Jupiters" - gas giants, in size and weight comparable to the largest planet of the solar system, but located tens of times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, the year on the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "Earth" days, and its gas shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It became a symbol of Provence and Southern France, but now there are fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender began to grow worse due to the arid weather and carrying the disease of insects, this caused a constant headache of scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Szes, an expert from the Providencial Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM, says: "Lavender in Provence is really under threat, because in recent years this plant has been affected by climate change: in spring and especially in the fall, the rainfall has become much less.
This affects the life of lavender.
And there are also small cicadas jumping on leaves insects carrying micro-bacteria, in very dry weather there are a lot of them. "
A lot is at stake.
Lavender not only attracts holidaymakers, lavender oil is very in demand in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Szes says: "Instead of very long ears with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or nonexistent.
Therefore, we have fewer parts containing essential oil. "
The solutions that are currently being considered include improving the distribution of water and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding varieties that are more resistant to drought.
Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Two-time world champion in hockey, Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 Alexander Semin met on the eve of the beginning hockey players and gave autographs to fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019 in the framework of the thematic week dedicated to ice hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could skate on a platform with artificial ice.
In addition, relay races, quizzes and games were organized with the drawing of souvenir products of student games, warming up from the federation of aerobics.
50 schoolchildren participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the guys to do as much as possible on sports grounds and stressed that the most important at the initial stage of training is hard work and a huge desire to practice hockey.
"It's great that in Krasnoyarsk there is such a platform as the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019, where novice athletes can directly ask questions to the team coaches," said the champion.
Note that the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019 are helping to promote student sports and a healthy lifestyle among the Krasnoyarsk residents.
The Universiade tent will work throughout the summer season until September 25, the press service of the Directorate of the Winter Universiade-2019 reports.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words
US State Department spokesman Heather Naouert, commenting on the briefing of the Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said it was necessary to find "areas for cooperation" with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found to "improve bilateral interaction."
An example of such a successful cooperation, Nauert called the agreement on Syria about the truce.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other," the diplomat said.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev's statement about a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said this, then, of course, she has the right to speak, but I can not say anything more about this," the State Department spokeswoman said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill toughening sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said that Washington declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that US sanctions will be in effect for decades.
In addition, according to the Prime Minister, the American establishment "has cleanly beat" Trump.
Missed in the Moscow region the bodybuilder was found in a strange dacha who had lost his memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very piquant circumstances: he left the car to go to the toilet.
Seven days he was unsuccessfully sought by friends and locals.
And Shamil was found at a strange dacha in Ramenskoye.
His completely naked found in his closet master.
Dagestan sportsman could not explain how he was here and what happened to him.
He could not even remember his name, and his passport was gone.
Identity helped the announcement of his loss.
Arriving on call physicians recorded a partial loss of memory and a brain injury in Hannetov, according to Mash.
Probably, the sportsman is waiting for other surprises.
The malefactors who kidnapped Shamil probably already visited his apartment, the keys to which he also stole.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
Actually received oil and gas revenues in July 2017 exceeded the estimate of 7.4 billion rubles., The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
Excess, as the agency explains, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar against the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, and also because of the excess of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of export of oil products of the forecast levels.
"The deviation of oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate corresponding to the Federal Law on the 2017-2019 federal budget is forecasted at +40.2 billion rubles in August 2017," the Ministry said.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated to purchase foreign currency in the domestic foreign exchange market during the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017, is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of buying foreign currency will amount to the equivalent of 2.07 billion rubles.
The Ministry of Finance of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Bank of Russia.
Each working day during this period, the Central Bank will conclude transactions for the purchase of foreign currency at the organized trading sessions of the Moscow Stock Exchange on a regular basis during the trading day.
Acquired foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
Murder of the journalist underlines that in Mexico it is becoming more dangerous.
Employees of the weekly newspaper "Riodose" usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the recent violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa associated with organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug dealers.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told that they should change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seems safer: taking children with them to an office in which they already threw a grenade in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote on the board, hanging in the room, three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name the names for each column - evidence is not needed, suspicions and internal sensations will suffice.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being kept by the government or cartels, a whole list of scoundrels, because of which the work on illuminating chaos in Mexico is becoming dangerous.
Violence does not give a respite, and among the corpses that are multiplying in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 people after the attacks and threats are under federal protection, and this year at least seven people were killed in seven states.
Among the latter - their publisher and inspirer, co-founder of "Riyodose" Javier Valdes Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdes wrote in one of his many books on violent drug-related crimes.
His absence is felt very keenly, although his presence is everywhere - a large picture of Valdes showing his middle finger, with the words "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodos building, two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wearing t-shirts that show his smile, face with glasses or his Panama brand.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death, journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although in 2010 the office of the special federal prosecutor was organized to investigate journalistic cases, so far, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been investigated.
As with most of the thousands of homicides committed each year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists' killers are rarely brought to trial.
Journalists "Riodos" insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are heartbroken, although around now it is much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice from talking about security at meetings, there is little benefit, "says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of Riodos in the capital city of Culiacan.
He managed to drive only a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, he was dragged out of the car and fired at him 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name - which means "Twelfth River".
The shooter left in his car and broke it nearby.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He had a wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually disperse quickly in Culiacan.
But about Valdez, almost everyone is silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions are struggling to fill the vacuum that has arisen.
Let's not say that one or more people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa every day, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two-story mausoleums of drug-carrying malls, which are larger than those of many living people.
Let's forget for a moment that the state of "tranquility" is simply when one of the cartels takes control of the seaside state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bokorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riyodos, is crushed by a sense of guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He thinks that the murder was helped by two mistakes.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, which is at war with Guzman's sons.
The publication could anger the sons, people who were supposedly members of the gang, bought up all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdes to leave his country for his own safety after another newspaper was captured that wrote about the same story.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was regarded as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He was so long gone from danger, his friends and colleagues thought that he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroest and in 2003, together with five colleagues founded "Riodos", selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without touching on the subject of drugs," said Bohorkes.
Over time, the newspaper earned the reputation of a bold and honest publication, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to the fact that in this edition they could read about what no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riodos received the prestigious Maria Moores Cabo Prize for reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for courage in investigating drug trafficking in Mexico, wherever he led.
He frankly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ award ceremony.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa - "this is a way of life," he said in October last year in an interview with Rompevento TV.
"You have to accept the tasks that fall on you as a journalist - either way, or you just play the fool."
I do not want to be asked: "What did you do when there were so many deaths around ... why did not you tell me what was going on?"
Employees of "Riodos" miss Valdes, a joker who cursed like a stevedore in the port, a friend, generous with hugs and tips, a teacher who knew how to hang himself alive.
They relied on the order that he had established.
He had to always wear his hat.
He had to go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: did he lose his love for the once-established order?
His death made them also doubt their calculations of how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They do not like it when you understand their wives, children, in their legal business and in underground airfields for the transport of drugs.
"These things were beyond the line," said Bohorkes.
The result, even at the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and a desire for self-preservation.
We must believe our instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says the editor of "Riodos" Andres Villareal, is that "the sense of smell can be deceived ... and then what happens to Javier happens."
The old rules, he says, and others, no longer operate in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In a room where the employees of the "Riodos" gathered for security training, it suddenly turned out to be forbidden to make cell phones: a few days before it became known that spyware programs that are sold exclusively to governments are used in Mexico to monitor journalists and public activists.
Outside, two policemen are hiding in the shade of a tree from the 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were given the task of the state government to guard the office of "Riodos", which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois quarter of Culiacan.
Some journalists half-jokingly asked if these policemen were not included in those 50 percent of the servants of the order, about whom the governor himself said that they can not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to the mountainous terrain, which is de facto under the control of gangs of drug dealers.
In the nearest issue, "Riodos" counted on three main topics.
This is the murder in Sinaloa brother of former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had exposure of government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officially, it was not announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it's time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated all levels of government for almost the entire past century.
Recently, against several governors from PRI, there have been high-profile allegations of corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo Guzmane slipped away from the military raid.
A few months ago, readers would look for a Valdez column with the most reliable information about the abduction.
"Previously, we would already know what happened," says Villareal, 46, for his lean physique nicknamed "El Flaco."
"Today all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdes' office is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers with protests against the murders of journalists, because employees have become what they never thought to become: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went the next morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office, dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in Michoacán in the west of the country three days after Valdes was killed.
They found a burnt body, and the authorities said that it was he, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak out louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On this day, Director Bohorekes was in Washington, trying to secure international support for the demand for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, the day after Valdes' murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
After that, she asked not to give her more tasks to cover the activities of the government, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdes said many times that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, its accomplices in the government and indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by gangs of drug dealers, but by orders of politicians and security services who are in collusion with organized crime.
Press Committee "Articulo 19" believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were committed by order of police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
Of course, murders frighten people.
Everyone remembers the death of the blogger Mary Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A note was written on her body, supposedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some publications preferred to close down, as the newspaper "El Norte" in the northern border state of Chihuahua after in March its correspondent Miroslav Brich was killed.
Others continue to hold on like El Manyana from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, "Diario Ciudad Juarez" publicly appealed to drug cartels through an editorial on the front page, entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists left their native states or even the country.
This is a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find a job, and they still look out for danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as it obviously happened with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fled from Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work, daily balance between risky decisions.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - admits that he is afraid to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was already ready for printing, the publishers of "Riyodos" sat on the sidewalk near the office and drank beer when suddenly their phones rang simultaneously.
A series of skirmishes between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Mazatlan left behind, according to confirmed data, 19 corpses.
The war continued to flare up, as promised in a series of messages from cartels discovered in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they through the mobile phone posted news on the website "Riyodos."
The next day I had to redo the first page.
Nearby, sirens howled - another shootout in the vicinity.
Bohorkes looked to see whether the policemen guarding them were ready for defense.
If they were frightened, they did not show it.
Sitting under the huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was on display for the whole of Sinaloa, the staff of "Riodose" continued his business.
"How can you think about closing," said Bohorkes, "if on the very day when Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the street to do a report?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it seems to be a statue, though horrifying.
Researchers said that the first found remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhinoceros, discovered by a Canadian miner, have survived so well that experts called it "Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they even could determine that the color of its scaly skin was reddish-brown - and say that it had, in some way, a "dark past".
In a report published in the journal "Contemporary Biology", it was described as "the best preserved of the Thyreofor in the history of the finds and one of the best specimens of the dinosaur in the world."
This fossil is a newly discovered specimen of the nodosaur, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good state stunned researchers who call him "really wonderful."
This herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind in the history of the finds, according to articles in the National Geographic journal.
He was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the Millennium Salloc Mill mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, in Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled upon something that seemed to be different from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Palaeontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was carried out on the detection of an animal inside an earthen block weighing 2500 pounds (1100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
"You just have to squint a little, and you can almost believe that he is sleeping," said lead author Caleb Brown, research fellow at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum, where the creation is being shown.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved specimens of dinosaurs - Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
Studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore, despite the fact that it was covered with a shell and resembled a walking tank, appeared to have been exposed to considerable danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This dinosaur covered with a powerful shell used red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators, and applied a protective technique known as protective paint, which is also used by many animals of our day.
This would allow him to quickly merge with the environment and avoid meeting enemies, experts say, suggesting that he was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This 110-million-year-old creature, belonging to the family of the nodosaurs, was widely covered in print in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Palaeontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and gave it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the laboratory assistant Mark Mitchell, one of the group's members, who spent more than 7,000 hours on his painstaking excavation.
The surprising safety of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international group of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor plates on his body.
They discovered a protective coloration, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the creature's upper was darker than its underside.
Although the protective coloration is well distributed, the discovery was a surprise, because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is much larger than the living animals with protective coloring.
It can be assumed that carnivorous dinosaurs were so actively hunting for this dinosaur that evolution preferred to camouflage confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with protective coloring - for example, deer, zebra or battleship - are much smaller and are more accessible prey, which indicates that the nosedosaur had to fight seriously for survival.
"A serious threat from predators for a massive, dinosaur covered with a powerful shell, shows how dangerous were the predatory dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the scales of the dinosaur also indicates that its skin should have been reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, seeking information about his life, including the preserved contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was carried into the sea, where it sank and fell back down to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as now in the south of Florida, and the rivers and oceans, most likely, spread much deeper into the land than now.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, and at the same time completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, now the animal looks almost the same as it looked then, in the Early Cretaceous.
You do not need to resort especially to the imagination to recreate it, you just have to squint slightly, and you can almost believe that he is sleeping. "
The Cretaceous period is an epoch when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, wandered around the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than the Borealopelta, one of his menacing ancestors could hunt the thyroid.
These include acrokantosaurus, a monster 38 feet long (11.5 meters) weighing six tons.
Scientists whose recent discoveries are published in the journal "Contemporary Biology" believe that Borealopelta was after death dumped into the sea and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the Millennium Mill near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, in Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum staff, this is the best-preserved tierophore in the world, along with the skin and armor, and it is intact, from the muzzle to the hip bones.
On average, these creatures reached approximately 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes protruding from their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore practitioner has treaded heavily on what is now Canada, until the flooded river carried him to the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its shell to the smallest detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates along the skull of the dinosaur.
As Michael Grechko wrote in an article for the National Geographic magazine, such a degree of preservation is "rare, like winning the lottery."
The longer I look at him, the more striking he seems.
The fossilized skin remains till now cover the tuberous armor plates, which dot the skull of the animal.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it are turned upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole. "
Mikheil Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia, and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did this without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
On the arrival of Saakashvili informs the Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which posted a video on his YouTube channel with his speech.
Saakashvili spoke at an event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against the Nazi troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to begin his speech in this language, he had to speak in English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician touched upon the topic of Georgia's cooperation with Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived him of his citizenship, the disgraced politician learned while in the United States.
How exactly he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is still unknown.
Earlier, the former governor of the Odessa region, Mikhail Saakashvili, said that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining Ukrainian citizenship was forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
The investigation period in the case of Vainzikher and Olkhovik was prolonged until January
The term of the preliminary investigation on the case of co-owner of the Renova group of companies Evgeny Olkhovik and the head of the T-Plus energy holding Boris Vainzikher was prolonged until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmanny Court is considering extending the accused house arrest.
The representative of the SC at the meeting reported on the decision to extend the period of the preliminary investigation for the last time.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as conduct investigative actions on the territory of several constituent entities of the Russian Federation," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly bribed the Komi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least one billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Vaynzikher, Olkhovik, as well as Mikhail Slobodin, the former head of Integrated Energy Systems CJSC, who headed VimpelCom until September 5th, paid bribes to the highest officials of the Komi Republic for setting the most favorable tariffs for heat and electricity, and creating favorable business conditions.
Vainzikher and Olkhovik were detained, transferred to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin disappeared from the investigation and was declared a federal wanted list.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
August 9, 2014 Brittany Ferrel was shocked to the core.
Just one day after arriving in New York as part of the tourist trip, a Saint Louis native was sitting on a bed in an apartment leased through Airbnb, scanning the Facebook tape on the phone.
She came upon the post of someone from high school.
It said: "The police have just killed an eighteen-year-old child, and he is still lying in the middle of the street."
Paying attention to the fact that no one else from her tape posted this information, puzzled, she closed the facebook and opened the twitter.
In her tape, there were a lot of user posts with the @TheePharoah nickname.
The rapper from the Big St. Louis in real time lit up the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old boy, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of the lifeless body of Brown, spread out in the street, where it will be for four hours.
"It's savagery," Ferrell thought.
But death was not something new for her and her circle.
She put the phone down, and later in the evening returned to the tweets that people are going to Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of the signal tape and screaming people and a man who claimed that he was the father of Brown holding a poster with the words: "A policeman from Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched the live broadcast as a police officer stands in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, "she said," cocked the rifle and yelled, "I'll kill you all ... animals!"
"This is a non-standard situation," according to own memories, Ferrel said then.
"This is not such a murder as those to which we are accustomed and which we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and I cried. "
She took a return flight ticket and flew home the next day.
Having landed at 11 pm, she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson in the next almost three years, was the topic of the new documentary film "Whose streets?", Which will be released on August 11.
This is a story about survival and protest, about love and loss, strength and stamina from the point of view of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrel was traveling to Ferguson with her daughter dressed in a flowered dress and a wreath in color, they remembered the conversation that had been conducted until this morning countless times, "about the experience of black people and their situation."
She remembers saying, "Do you remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now, because the policeman killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and that was wrong. "
"I could not help taking her," Ferrell said later.
"What is happening today is the culmination of ... what happened before.
She should know about it, see it and be brought up on it.
It should not only be well versed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black people's experience and their positions and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she personally does not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel that I would do her a disservice if she were to shield her from it. "
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made the first stop on South Florida Road, on a site across the street from the police station, which had become something of a tent camp, while activists waited for reports of the final non-disclosure of Officer Darren Wilson
There, Ferrel and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who was preparing lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to protesters.
Little by little in his mind, Ferrel acquired a new type of activism.
"My activism has completely changed since August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Medical Students, National Minorities, and was engaged in food fairness and health inequalities among black communities.
"I did not have the experience of the organizer.
It's come by itself. "
A few weeks later at the evening demonstration, Ferrel met Sabaa Folayan, one of her co-directors.
Folayan said that she and her chief cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrel came up with the question: "Do you want to document, or are trying to find a story on which you can play?"
This skepticism was inspired by numerous people, often white, who came to the community in order to benefit from his pain and stamina.
As explained in a recent interview with Folayan, "We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson do not get into the spotlight, and they wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already teamed up with her co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on the issues of those sentenced to death.
His participation aroused sympathy for the project with Ferrel and another six local residents with whom the team of the Whose Street project maintained contact over the years after the murder of Brown.
"In this documentary, not someone speaks for us or with us, it's we who speak," Davis said.
"This was for me the most important, as these people will be represented, because this is how I myself will be represented."
And although the goal of the project was not to focus on Ferrel's experience at all - in an effort to show that the movement "is not about a leader-savior, but about how the community unites," Folayan said - she was the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose streets?" Shows the unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrel's life, for example, the way she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell, laughing at the first time she saw the finished product.
"But I realized that when you do this kind of work and humanize blacks, there must be some level of vulnerability."
In addition, the story of Ferrell again discusses and accentuates the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader context of the movement "Black Life Matters".
Two of the three founders of the movement - those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag in social networks after the murder of a black teenager, Treyvon Martin in 2012 - rank themselves as homosexuals.
"Black homosexual women in leadership positions support this whole movement," says Ferrel. "And that's because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden. "
Folayan agreed with this statement, noting that "the movement, in fact, is supported by black women and a lot of homosexual black women."
Nevertheless, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination", and that Ferrel was not chosen as the central character of the film because of her distinctive characteristics.
"She was the person who awakened this energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that she was in the forefront, because when"
You can feel its energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long no movie cameras, but there are complex racial connections between the community and the police.
Ferrel will be on probation for two and a half years for blocking the highway during the demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of a place that she calls home, simply: "Bardak."
She still holds on to the roving she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson full three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We must win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. "

The emergence of similarities: the artist creates portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the center of the hall in the Friedman Gallery in New York from the ceiling on the wire hang people's faces - white, black and brown, all something subtly similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from the smears from the cheeks and hair trim sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent trimmings from Fort-Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called "The emergence of similarity."
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harbor, whose art unites technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a female transsexual and famous dissident, whom Barack Obama mitigated the verdict just three days before the end of his presidency.
Having analyzed the DNA obtained from Manning with a computer program and used it to create three-dimensional portraits of persons that could be in people with such a genome, Dewey-Harborg created a deep, if not easy-to-comprehend manifesto dedicated not only to the plasticity of DNA data - to various ways of interpreting them and the incoherent determinism of these interpretations - but to the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name of Bradley Edward, but from adolescence openly said that she considers herself a woman, in 2013 she was sentenced to 20 episodes, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photographs in prison were inaccessible, so only one of her photos was known: a grainy black-white selfie, in which Manning in a platinum-tinted wig, clearly uncomfortable, sitting behind the wheel of a car, with this photo and associate her.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed its 2012 project "Visions of Strangers" with great success.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people with the help of forensic evidence like cigarette butts and chewing gum, isolating DNA from this garbage and creating images of how these people might look.
And then she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in jail and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at the preview of the new press exhibition.
At that time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she would like to get a portrait created from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her imprisoned muse became pen pals and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote the comic book "Depressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Canungo, who portrayed how in the future the president will mitigate the punishment of Chelsea and she will be able to visit the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just days after the book was published was a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong in the fact that the exhibition opens right now, when Donald Trump declares war on people disclosing sensitive information in the government, and devises new ways to kindle the feud on Twitter, which he is called upon to mitigate.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of this all in time, she said that "by chance nothing happens."
In the artist's statement, written on the wall of the gallery, Manning's huge signature downstairs (with a heart instead of a dot over the "i" in her surname) calls for an end to "automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar of C, G, and A penciled out.
Including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as artistically exquisitely expressed artist), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how we are all remarkably similar, at least in terms of their biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open the genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Harbor, her 2007 video work "False Memories" is also exhibited here.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition, which fits in one room, is the above-mentioned novel in comic books.
On it, Manning in the style of King Kong appears above the US Correctional Barracks building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," is written there.
"Therefore, never stop."
"This is a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me," says the artist, who greets us from Philadelphia.
"I still have goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning had not yet seen the exhibition in person - as it was prophetically portrayed in comic books - but when she comes, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulacra, gathered like crowds of protesters.
This is also done deliberately, like everything at the exhibition up to the height (5-2, Manning's growth), on which genetic haplogroups were drawn with a pencil.
"I would have hung them on the walls before, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," says Dewey Harbor about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, as the movement that stood and for its liberation."
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University is wanted by the police on charges of murder
According to the police, there is a nationwide round-up on a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who is wanted as a suspect because a man killed in death was found in a luxurious room in Chicago.
According to the Cook County Courthouse reports, on Monday, warrants were issued for the detention for a premeditated murder without the right to release on bail Forty-two-year-old Wyndham Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, the twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after he was inflicted multiple stabbing wounds.
A warning issued by the Chicago police says that the body was found on July 27.
The policemen received a call, they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found a victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and now the detectives are investigating death from stab wounds, considering her murder, while the police are searching intensively for two suspects.
Latem has held the position of adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbaj, vice president of communications, said in a statement sent by email that Latem was on administrative leave and that he was forbidden to go to the Northwestern University campuses.
"Now this is a criminal case, which is being investigated by authorized persons, and the North-Western University cooperates with the investigation," Kabbaj said.
Warren works as a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
A representative of the University and Somerville College said in a statement sent by e-mail: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to US investigative bodies."
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues are shocked and want him to surrender.
Head of Communications of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said that he strongly advises the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have speculation about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and federal authorities help in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the policeman was called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who just received a mysterious message that something happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene horrible.
Guglielmi said that it is unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
According to him, the data from the video cameras confirm that Latem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latem and the victim linked the relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management issued an appeal to the guests, in which it was reported: "At the moment, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will fulfill the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) set for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be fulfilled in the near future.
"A certain stage in fulfilling the requirements was passed, RUSADA got the right to plan and conduct tests jointly with UKAD (UK anti-doping agency).
The road map for WADA was updated accordingly, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map for restoring the status of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA's work and was recently published on the website of this organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could be difficult for Russia.
"Everything was announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian anti-doping organizations should publicly acknowledge the results of an investigation commissioned by WADA Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, in which it was alleged that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
Touching upon this issue, Mutko said: "We are investigating, as our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures were taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what was not. "
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged the previous problems in the Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
Undoubtedly, no one is going to accept this report, "Smirnov added.
WADA removed RUSAD from conducting the doping control in November 2015 after the doping scandal.
However, in June this year he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the Moscow office of the organization in July, WADA's general director Olivier Niggly stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to restore its work.
The fire in the 79-storey tower in Dubai is extinguished
A major fire that occurred in one of the highest residential buildings in the world, the tower of The Torch, extinguished, reports Reuters.
It is noted that firefighters managed to cope with all the fires of fire by 4.00 local time (3.00 MSK).
Local authorities reported that as a result of the incident no one was hurt.
For the time of extinguishing the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were blocked.
The causes of the incident are still unknown.
Earlier it was reported that in Dubai, the 79-storey residential skyscraper The Torch is burning, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world.
All the tenants were evacuated on time.
Unimaginable outfit Buzovy shook the fans: trousers that do not cover the panties
Scandalous leading reality show "House-2" Olga Buzova struck the spectators of the Europa Plus Live festival with dances in shorts.
In the eyes of thousands of fans, the newly-born singer with a duet with Nastya Kudri sang the song "We'll be hot."
Both girls took to the stage in provocative "trousers" sewn in such a way that the underwear of the singers turned out to be in sight.
On the trousers were inscriptions Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier it was reported that a change in the appearance of Buzovy was commented by a specialist from one of the Moscow clinics of plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
On Friday, August 4, the news service "Radio 4" reported with reference to foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation with the Crimea and "destabilization in the east of Ukraine."
At the same time Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia, however, is possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said that relations between the US and Russia are at a dangerously low level, and the US Congress blamed it.
Metro of Ekaterinburg is developing a new method of payment
In October, the journey to the Yekaterinburg subway can be paid with a bank card, Pavel Vedernikov, general director of I-Network, said in an interview with the Regional newspaper.
Our goal is to introduce the same system of fare payment in the metro to the World Cup in 2018 as in other large cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the mundialya, to be able to use the subway with their bank cards, not buying tokens and not standing in line," he said.
Startups that will help your company not become another "Uber"
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction amongst employees of her startup in e-commerce, but the polls did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"He was never consistent and objective," said Errett, managing a San Francisco-based 75-person company, Madison Reed, which deals with e-commerce in hair care.
Therefore, she appealed to third parties for help.
Now there is a new kind of start-ups in the field of work with personnel that help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure the involvement of employees, they allow companies to do quick surveys, access specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and hot lines for complaints, and in some cases allow informants to pass top management and contact the directorate directly.
"Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?" Says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Glint start-up company in Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Herrett said that she has achieved a greater understanding of what her employees think and feel for three years using Glint.
In addition to express polls and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a company heat card and shows in visual form, which departments have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows them to understand why.
The companies are gradually realizing that they need to monitor the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become another "Uber", who was involved in the scandal when a former employee published a blog post describing the aggressive situation in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for profitable business.
According to the Internet portal "Let's talk about payment", dedicated to financial technologies, the industry of global governance, regulation and compliance by 2020 can cost more than 118.7 billion dollars.
The Convercent start-up from Denver, Colorado, helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid the fall of Uber's reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, among the customers appeared "Uber".
Like "Glint", "Convercent" allows companies to send custom-made polls to staff opinions, collect confidential responses in real time and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages, which allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, complaints go directly to the directorate.
"The court of public opinion seized power from the inspectors," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company mistreates employees or behaves unethically, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of boycotts from customers, outflow of employees and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a chain of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures and offer an easy way to contact the company's head office.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look up the phone number or email of the head office, file an official complaint and hope that they will take it seriously.
Often this was a frightening and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, the head of the legal department of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now, when the company uses the Convercent service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment and unfair remuneration - can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I can approach a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees," said Vitrano, who manages the risk management group of the Ruby Tuesday network.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
According to Quinland, the companies began to take a more serious attitude toward ethics, values and employee involvement in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of the Enron Enron case.
But it was only when "social networks got mass spread" that companies realized that they could not keep their dirty laundry from spreading viral in the network.
"Before using technologies to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies with a regular fee for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that was approved by venture investors who supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent received funding of $ 10 million from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $ 47 million.
Glint received $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, resulting in a total capital of $ 60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of research demonstrates that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they did before.
In markets with tough competition, such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects - this is just the minimum required.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work in a company, they feel they are being heard, and that the work they do is producing results, they are more likely to make such a company successful," says Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, using both Convercent and Glint.
Investors receive income when businesses from their portfolio are doing well, businesses are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If analytical tools of the third party promise to increase the loyalty and involvement of employees, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to experts on culture in the workplace, it is important to have data on the involvement of employees.
But the data are useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can create the impression that change is coming.
And if the changes do not come quickly enough, or do not come at all, frustration can develop, and employees will lose interest.
"If you are going to ask for 4000 offers, you should be prepared to conduct 4,000 conversations," says Russell Rath, president of consulting at the management company Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you do not go to the end, employees will guess:" Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you do not care, why should not I care? "
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports a problem with the help of Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees dissatisfied with the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce a communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long term this knowledge will help it to more effectively retain employees in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you do not try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose the company.
In Barnaul, a new asphalt is opened on Prospekt Krasnoarmeyskoye
In Barnaul, cardinal measures were taken to eliminate the cause of the asphalt failures on Krasnoarmeyskoy Avenue.
The place where pits twice appeared on the recently paved roadway (intersection with Molodezhnaya Street), it was decided to "open".
Recall, the collapse of a small section of the road near the tramways was due to the fact that the earth sank in the area of an ownerless, unexploited network.
According to Deputy Chairman of the City Committee for Roads, Improvement, Transport and Communication of Ivan Garmat, a detailed survey will be conducted for a detailed survey and elimination of the prerequisites for collapse.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is supposed that restoration of formwork of ownerless communications and their concreting will be required.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
Team Bruins have to deal longer due to the fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day
Time is approaching eleven at night, a crowd of footballers from the University of California in Los Angeles is delayed to chat on one side of the new training fields of the team located on the campus.
Some of them pulled their T-shirts, revealing their backs shining with sweat after a tense first day of the sports camp.
For many team players, these moments of idleness make a break in the middle of the day.
Players who have been booked for summer classes after a three-hour training will go back to the hostels to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning they will return to Wasserman's football center for meetings at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, the Bruins coach Jim Mora said: "In the next three days these guys are waiting for a meat grinder."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the burden for the players, actually extended their working day - at least until the examinations on Friday.
Therefore, the beginning of the first three training sessions of the team of the University of California in Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 pm, so that they fit in an already tight schedule of players.
The side effect of the lack of two workouts per day is a larger number of days with one workout, and the Bruins move the camp start for almost a week compared to last year and conduct training during the summer school for the first time in six seasons of Mora in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to conduct 18 training sessions until August 20 inclusive, before starting the official preparation for the first game of the season against the team of Texas A & M University in September.
Mora said he supports the change in the rules of the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that because of him in the tight schedule of players, there was another point.
"For three or four days, we give them this huge load, this is a serious test," Mora said.
"And they just overcame it, they work, they are wonderful guys.
I think that when we live until Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great. "
When the camp is over, the University of California at Los Angeles will make the training closed, it's not an easy task, as its fields are in direct line of sight from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombarded with soccer balls that crossed the defensive net outside the gate.
Players from the "Bruins" have to occupy the hotel since this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms are vacant during the season, there may be a problem.
"We will have security," Mora said.
"This is a serious problem, and I do not exaggerate the danger, suggesting that someone can rent a room, sit there and record a workout on video.
If you have a videotape training, it's very serious.
But we will have security there and there will be security in parking lot number 8.
We will do everything we can with what we have.
I will not worry too much about this.
We have a plan. "
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg discharged from hospitals
All those who suffered during the terrorist act in the St. Petersburg metro in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of the vice-governor Anna Mityanina.
According to the data at the end of July, there were three people in hospitals, "TV Center" reports.
Recall, an explosion in the subway of St. Petersburg thundered on April 3 this year.
The bomb was blown up by a suicide bomber Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the terrorist attack, 15 people died, as well as the singer himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
Recall, on the eve of Rospotrebnadzor recommended the Metro Petersburg to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport security, in particular, increasing the number of frames of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens the fact-check in the fight against fake news
Facebook will be more likely to send texts that are suspicious of hoaxes to independent experts, and to show their conclusions under original posts, the largest social network of the world said on Thursday, which is trying to deal with so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company said that it was starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible hoaxes, send them for verification, and possibly show the results of fact-checking under the initial post.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main ways to spread the so-called fake news, which, according to many, influenced the presidential election in 2016 in the United States.
This issue is also actively debated in Europe after French voters were deceived by false reports before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany before the September elections they announced support for the plan to fine social networks if they do not promptly remove posts that incite hatred.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook announced the testing of a new fact-tracking algorithm, which was launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition, to see which messages are being challenged by independent reviewers, people want a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and share," wrote Sarah Sue, the Facebook news feed manager, in her unit.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the function of "related articles" and work on other changes in the news line to solve the issue of fake news.
Create a novel-comics: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's tiny castle was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 70s and 80s served as a refuge for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy place in the valley of the river Bewl in the county of Kent, he watched the turbulent history around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with a shock of hair and a penchant for historical documents, a novel comic book.
"It seems to me, it's so beautiful - to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says enthusiastically.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
"Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Guardian era and tells about the families who lived in Scotney, each story illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkevich, Brioni May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on archival data: in 2014 he wrote "The teeth of a dead man and other stories" - a collection of materials from the documents of the British Library, this project suddenly touched him to the depths of his soul.
"I could be touched simply by a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for Jacobites," he says.
"It's a fingerprint of his finger"
And letters always smell of smoke, because in those days fire was lit for lighting.
And in 300 years, in the future, it seems to you that you are also there.
Oh, how I love archives! "
For a person embraced by such a passion for old papers, get support from the National Foundation and the English art council and live in the castle for four months ("To be honest, I got a little tired out there") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent days studying the "new" Victorian castle, walking through the archives and viewing the numerous treasures of the estate and antiques - for example, the heads of hyenas on the walls or bottles that had lain in the ditch for centuries.
He walked through the park and through the ruins of the old castle, talking with foresters, gardeners and sometimes with artists working on illustrations for his book.
Then at night he "drank whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Scotney Castle is not very well understood, because the National Foundation received full access to it only in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the employees only began to understand the archive, which he describes as "something that aristocrats have been dumping in the attic for centuries."
Diaries, letters from the times of the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You think that land disputes are boring," Rhodes says, "but two families fought for this birch.
It happens so, guys! "
In some stories of the collection, the castle becomes the starting point for wider research in English history: for example, in Rabotnik, the hero leaves the newly constructed castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
"There is information about the riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in a book called" Knightly families of Kent and Sussex, "says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in these places, and I thought that rebellion is a suitable beginning.
Maybe they were connected? "
Other subjects are closely related to the history of the castle - for example, "Priest", which tells about the Jesuit priest, whom the Darrel family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or Smuggler, about the eighteenth-century smuggler Arthur Darrel, who is believed to have staged his own funeral, stuffing the coffin with stones (this was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug up).
Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family from all that Scotney inhabited: "The gentlemen seem to have been a perfect crook, always getting into debt and spending money on things they could not afford.
In different generations, Darrel men solved their problems with debts, marrying rich elderly women - I imagine them as a company of handsome guys who are able to care for the heirs of big fortunes. "
After graduating from the castle, Rhodes looks for other opportunities to get a unique writing experience.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elyamyamyaka - a place where in the early 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it was again overgrown with forest.
But Scotney remains for him a special place.
"It was sad for me to leave," he says.
"I felt like this: dammit, I have to go back to real life again."
Fifteen largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and Otkrytiye FC, seven more credit institutions are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the share of organizations leaving the ARB will account for at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a way out - all the banks that announced a break with the ARB are negotiating with the Association of Regional Banks "Rossia", headed by a well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the State Duma Financial Market Committee, which was recognized by the results of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma committee and deputy by the number of draft laws.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was made during the discussion in the Federation Council when new draft laws were considered at the Interregional Banking Council, in particular, involving a new classification of banks depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, president of the ARB, said that, in the opinion of the association, this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which in this way try to limit the opportunities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims, criticism of the Central Bank sounded, which, according to Tosunyan, is not always justifiably revoked licenses from some banks, which, however, was followed by an objection from the representative of the Central Bank: many executives of defraud banks, in particular Vneshprombank, were part of the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a highly sensitive banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen major banks to disagree with the ARB policy and begin preparing to join the Rossiya association, noting that "the effectiveness of the ARB's work is low and no constructive dialogue within the banking community is actually taking place."
Investors will be better off
What's the matter over?
We will immediately answer the main question that arises from the slightest malfunction or conflict in the banking sector or next to it: depositors are not threatened, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Anatoly Aksakov, who is known for his scrupulousness in all matters relating to the interests of banks and their clients, is a top-level professional highly regarded in the Central Bank: practically all of the Central Bank's management are present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator go through expert assessments of the "regionalals".
In the personnel-organizational plan, obviously, there are no special shocks either.
Undoubtedly, the ARB falls into a difficult financial and managerial situation after it has lost such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest one - established in 1991 - an organization defending the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential for continuing to improve banking legislation and the sphere of monetary circulation in general.
It can not be said that in the association "Russia" with open arms are ready to accept new members on any terms, according to the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("maybe too much will want"), who on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that "the next day representatives of banks leaving the ARB asked me to consider the possibility to increase the potential of our association" Russia. "
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, and also pay more attention to new banking technologies.
Now there is a negotiation process, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September in the framework of the international banking forum.
We will define ourselves there.
Also Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that he "does not stand for the chair," called Georgy Luntovsky, the new head of the renewed association "Russia," who left the post of the Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank in September, highly characterizing his business and human qualities.
August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now resting in the Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Rossiya Association, which plans to consider the agenda of the extraordinary congress of Russia.
The entry of cars with a gasoline engine into the major cities of Russia will not be limited
Deputy Transport Minister Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with a gasoline engine into major Russian cities will not be limited.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually improve the ecological class.
And there the concept immediately shifted to zero emissions.
I believe that technically we are not ready for this.
The question is: since when?
This is the phrase at the level of slogans - let's forbid it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
The whole city will be closed?
"In 20 years - I do not know, maybe this will happen," Prime Minister quotes Prime Minister.
Previously, the newspaper Izvestia reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study proposals on possible options for state support for electric transport, presented to the government by the general director of PJSC KamAZ Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, are the use of cars with ICE in large cities and resorts.
Washington changes the rules for obtaining a green card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump said that a new US immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining a green card will change.
The plan provides for reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and are supported by the president.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise salaries and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and do so by changing how the US gives green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who speak English, have money resources that allow them to support themselves, and possess skills that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, according to the US media.
The appearance of sex robots is real, and this should bother us
We had no time to think that the year 2017 could not get any worse, a new report on technological progress in the production of sex robots came out.
Hmm.
Sex robots are now in the spotlight.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Honored Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and FRR co-founder, we must take them seriously.
Users will be able to choose the eye color of robots, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
"People giggle about this, but firms already send a lot of them to consumers, and soon we will see them much more," Sharkey said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls evolved from their inflatable brethren into robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "customize" their robots to their own taste, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality", compared to which the Stepford Wife would seem very progressive, worries even more.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the company "RealBotix robot" allows users to customize in robots the qualities that they find attractive - for example, shyness.
There are also sex robots Roxxxy Gold, developed by "True Companion", which come with a pre-programmed personality - for example, "Cold Farra" gives the impression of being shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "bold" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that suits yours perfectly," the site "True Companion" enthusiastically reports.
Therefore, she loves what you love, does not like what you do not like, and so on.
She's in a mood for the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she can "be in the mood"! "
In the appearance of sex robots, much is troubling - not least because they replace real human relationships - but most of all worried about the subordinate image of a woman, the association with rape, which causes the mastery of the Cold (read: resisting) Farah.
On the site "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared with a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) Can have a vibrator, why men can not have Roxxxy?" - says the website.
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, deviating from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with submission as an optional additive.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although the FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery, can be very instructive in regard to the meaning of the era in which we live.
And many people are not bad and not aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It's not a coincidence - that these complex sex robots appeared just when the rights of women around the world were threatened, when the president is in the White House, who boasts of sticking to women.
The most terrible thing in the television series "The Story of a Servant" is not graphic images, twisted bodies and squeezed eyes, but exactly how this vision seems realistic.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it does not seem so big.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve such physical similarity to real women (only with porn star proportions), which technology allows.
Their creators want them to look people to the touch, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is their "characters" that robots are not like real women.
They can not break with their partners or escape from them.
They do not have either their lives or biographies-anything that could indicate independence or something else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, these are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, they are maids.
A native of Los Angeles, Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, who will compete for the national team of Ukraine in 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which starts on August 31.
This in an interview with the portal BeBasket said the general manager of "blue-yellow" Andrei Lebedev.
We tried to agree with Jeter, but, unfortunately, he will not come for family reasons.
We will go to the Eurobasket without a naturalized player, because we do not want to take someone we do not know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
Let me remind you that with the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian team took the sixth place at Eurobasket-2013 for the first time and entered the world basketball championship for the first time, where the "yellow-blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the US native scored an average of 15.4 points for the game, made 3 rebounds and gave 5 assists.
Jeter has ceased to speak for the national team of Ukraine since the departure of the head coach of our national team, American Mike Fratello, who left this post in 2015.
Men's Eurobasket-2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will play its matches of the group tournament on the Promised Land.
Yevgeny Murzin's wards in Group B will have five fights: with Germany (August 31), Italy (September 2), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our men's team held two control matches, which were lost to the Dutch and Belarusians.
The great feat of Trump?
Mita Romney seems very reasonable
In the era of Trump, the commonplace was the fact that political disputes, which polarized the American electorate, at the micro level were broken by some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers were full of columns about how to cope with the terrible relatives voting for Trump.
It seems that we are all tense so that we will soon burst.
Less is said about Trump's ability to connect families.
I write about this because my cousin, the leftist-looking poetess from Chicago, who had long been at loggerheads with Republicans in her family, came to visit me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting in the fight against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
At Trump at the White House, all she knows, including the Republican brother, with whom she argued about politics for decades, suddenly and oddly found themselves on the same side.
For dinner, this is undoubtedly good, but I can not help but think that in a broader context this can be quite dangerous.
Trump breathed forces into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will no longer be amazed by his antics.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the backdrop of his standards, will suddenly seem like a model of common sense.
I realized that I really miss today the old-fashioned madness of Mitt Romney - with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14% income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looks like) - in comparison with Trump, both seem a very small evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will simply have to be in his mind to be seen as a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to the carousel in Central Park - the biggest carousel in the New York City Parks Department and the best way to spend three dollars in the city if you do not need caffeine.
Horses are formidable and huge, pictures of fiberglass on the central drum - grimacing clowns and animals, which, bent over, look terrified at their backs - extremely ominous, and ringing music, strangely enough, enthralls.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: the views from skyscrapers become obsolete, the silhouettes of buildings are too boring to cause awe, and the reality of the city does not keep up with the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I still worry that day when I learned that the Suiss cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet (Ye Olde Swiss Cottage thematic pub does not count), but a large circular crossroads in North London.
And the carousel in the Central Park is still an unusual, magical place in which a child of two, a child of eleven and two women in their 40s can have a great time.
If I could put a carousel estimate, I would put a top five, but fortunately, no one asked me about it.
And in the department store this week, I was asked before evaluating the "experience" of purchases on a scale from one to five stars.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street everything is the same plus the option to accompany the tip by 15 percent - this is for the order at the counter.
As a result, not only the neutral interaction is slowing down, but also one has to introduce a personal attitude into a situation that does not imply it.
The poor saleswoman at the department store smiled confusedly as I tiredly evaluated my experience of handing her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital because of chest pains
Pistorius leaves the prison because of a visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital to treat cuts on his wrists, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of a fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of premeditated murder after an appeal by the prosecutor's office against the initial verdict for manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting it several times through the toilet door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said that he took his girlfriend for a night thief, who hid in his closet.
The prosecutor's office announced its intention to file another protest, this time against the six-year term of Pretorius, who, according to her, is too soft.
The Attorney General's Office said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal will be considered this year.
The term of Pretorius can increase by 15 years, if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspected of beating NTV journalist
The city law enforcement officers have chosen a preventive measure in the form of a written undertaking not to leave the place for the man who attacked NTV television journalist Nikita Razvozzhayev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
"As part of the investigation of the criminal case instituted under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (" Poboy ") against a 32-year-old man who hit a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Gorky Central Park of Culture and Recreation, the suspect was given a preventive measure in the form of a written undertaking not to leave his place and proper behavior," the Wolf clarified.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol had been drawn up against the suspect for disobeying the police.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast on the Day of the Airborne, a drunk man approached the correspondent and struck his face.
As it turned out later, the hooligan has nothing to do with the airborne forces.
According to Razvozzhayev himself, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking, according to the BBC TV channel.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people were arrested in Sithonia, who put tents in the wrong place, including two Bulgarian citizens.
They were released the same day, while the investigation is still under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the BT TV that the citizens of Bulgaria were subsequently released.
The Greek authorities tightened control over the free camping and already set serious fines to all those caught while staying in a place not intended for this purpose.
Inspections will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court can impose a fine.
The Russian Foreign Ministry accused the US Vice President of the rhetoric of the Cold War era,
Statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pens have been criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
"It is regrettable to note that Washington is sliding ever deeper into the primitive ideological stamps of the Cold War era, which are completely divorced from reality," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
So the Foreign Ministry reacted to Pence's words about the "Russian threat" and attempts to forcibly redraw the borders, told them in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice "either with the West or with Russia" and the lack of evidence of the thesis about the allegedly non-alternative entry of the entire South Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to repel Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
"We call on our American colleagues to stop defaming Russia and its foreign policy line, which is invariably based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Feldsher injured in road accident with ambulance in Moscow region
An accident occurred in the Moscow region of Stupino, as a result of a collision of a foreign car with an ambulance, the paramedic suffered.
Today around 08:10 Moscow time there was a collision of a Mitsubishi car with an ambulance in the city of Stupino, Moscow Region.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance turned over," TASS was told in the press service of the Moscow region's Ministry of Internal Affairs.
At the scene of the accident, law enforcement officers work, the circumstances of the incident are being clarified.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw out her newborn son at the construction site, wrapping her in a cellophane bag.
In the evening of August 3, a message was received from the local resident in the Razdelnyansky police department that he had found a package with an infant in an unfinished private house.
"Law enforcement officers and doctors left the scene of the incident, who promptly took the child to a medical facility," the Odessa National Commander of the National Police said.
The doctors determined that the boy was born several hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of the umbilical cord.
In the course of the immediate operational-investigative measures, the identity of the woman in childbirth was established - a 36-year-old local resident.
It was also found that the woman has three other young children.
As noted in the chapter, in the field of view of law enforcers the family had not previously fallen into the special account and did not consist.
Currently, the police establish the circumstances and reasons that forced the woman to this act, after which a procedural decision will be made.
Now the baby is under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature baby into a garbage disposal facility.
Grigory Leps: "I'm eager to fight, although 55 - not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage Grigory Leps will celebrate his 55th birthday next Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer talked to Izvestia's columnist.
I remember how your "fifty kopecks" was celebrated.
A special marquee in the Luzhniki Stadium, Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday man, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You surely figured then how he would like to spend his next five-year plan.
Have the plans come true?
If we talk about the profession, it was a good period.
I worked a lot, triped three times with tours all over the country, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
I released two good albums.
Of course, now I'm not the same as, let's say, 20 years ago.
Biological clock is not fooled.
Singing like I did in my 30s, it's getting harder.
Nevertheless, I'm eager to fight, I do not want to stop.
And I'm with new people, it seems to me, I'm on a different level.
With them you and the new album are recorded, the first in three years.
Yes, we are working on it now.
Actually, we have already recorded everything in my studio and now we will send it to be mixed in Los Angeles.
He is called "Why are you so serious?" Based on the song of the same name, which was written in conjunction with Timati.
It is not yet completely ready, so we have not yet laid it out.
We will do this later, when we will also remove the clip.
And the album will be presented in November - to a series of my jubilee concerts in Moscow's "Crocus City Hall".
To your new record, a classy American drummer Chris Coleman put his hand.
You, I think, wanted to attract him to your tour team?
In my opinion, Coleman today is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world.
He came to my studio, wrote down his parts.
I suggested that he join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer who participates in various projects, "Izvestia") suggested.
But for prolonged work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
It was about fees from € 35 thousand to € 45 thousand per month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space I would find worthy musicians.
And I found an excellent drummer Max Malyshev.
Generally it is better to feed your own (smiling).
Sometimes I want to find fault with one of them, but not for what.
For example, guitarist Fyodor Dosumov is highly rated internationally.
Western music magazines write about him, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wai, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists has come, with another performing technique."
Your album comes down in Los Angeles, American musicians cooperate with you, but you still can not come to the US?
Are you trying to lift this ban?
Now, frankly, I do nothing.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I really sincerely regret that I can not get to America.
I have said many times that I study there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful.
We are not stupider of them, but we do not have such experience, school.
Before our performers of popular music for 70 years, absolutely no tasks were set that American musicians always solved.
They aspired to the highest quality sound.
And I try to follow the same principles.
Now for some reason, the United Kingdom refused to admit me for ten years.
But I still every year I will apply for a visa to the British Embassy, so that I will be allowed to go there again and, most importantly, to work there.
The rest of Europe treats me favorably.
And already in August, you have planned a concert in Monaco, not custom-made, and posters, right?
Yes, in Monte Carlo there is a good hall "Sporting", I there already once acted.
Now they have invited me again, and, as far as I know, all tickets for the concert have already been sold out.
On "Rendezvous Laima Vaikule", which will start on July 20 in Jurmala, will you go?
She invited me, and I, of course, responded.
Laima is a wonderful singer and a great woman, able to give herself and beautiful vocal, and even a whisper.
After the tour and jubilee concerts, as far as I know, you always want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in the discography.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be completely differently done.
I want to record about 80-90 Vysotsky songs in about the same pitch as he did himself.
Only voice and guitar.
No other arrangement.
I will be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to involve in the album and Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum.
I talked with him about this topic, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see how it goes.
You and Boris Grebenshchikov gradually introduced songs into your repertoire.
Maybe then you can record an album of his things?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful person and a great musician.
I crossed it several times and asked: can I sing this or that song?
He replied: "Gregory, I write songs so that they will be performed."
Please try, sing.
Probably, it's interesting to record such an album.
While I do not have a similar task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I, perhaps, will make such a project.
If you do not concentrate completely on the affairs of your production center.
I believe, while you have not yet realized its potential, have not signed contracts with all the artists that interest you?
There are a number of performers whom I would like to have under my wing, but they are independent, held people.
Do you mean Sergei Lazarev?
Sergei - a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can disagree with something about his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in "Voice".
We signed a contract with him and work.
In our pop music, such singers are a rarity.
It will be truly a pity if he does not reach those heights he deserves.
I'm trying to pick up his repertoire, I'm making clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy songs for them, I pay poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
At the exit they will receive a recorded album, several clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although it will be pleasant for me if one of them achieves commercial success and pays me the interest that we agreed on in the contract.
But if this does not happen, I will not block any oxygen.
Let everyone work, make their way, prove how I once proved.
If tomorrow you are invited to make a tour around Ukraine and guarantee entry into the country, will you go?
I'm still invited there.
In general, we are talking about closed events.
And as for the big tour ...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, by my own conviction flew to Syria on the same plane, which then crashed.
If tomorrow they say that you need to fly to some other point in the interests of the state, I'll fly.
And I do not care what the bloggers and other critics think about me.
I sincerely regret that we managed to do this with Ukraine.
Because I think: we are one people and should be together.
I'm sorry that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
Before that, I gave 40-50 concerts in Ukraine for a year.
Met, as nowhere else.
A very grateful audience.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik ...
In Ukraine, the mass of gifted people, and sincerely sorry that now they can not fully throw out their talent on a broad Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would gladly invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, for example Slava Vakarchuk, and made a joint concert with him.
But, I think, this is unlikely at the moment ...
Andrei Okhlopkov was transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known to Kommersant, the technical director of the spaceport Vostochny Andrei Okhlopkov started work at the Khrunichev State Space Research and Production Center (SCNPC).
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Vostochny cosmodrome, but because of disagreements with the leadership of the Center for the Operation of Ground and Space Infrastructure (CENSCI), he was transferred to an enterprise in Moscow Fili, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Okhlopkov will not be a replacement in the position of a technical director, most likely they will be abolished, and the functionality will be distributed among the CENSC divisions.
The fact that the technical director of the East and the deputy director general of the Center for Economic Development Andrei Okhlopkov moved to the Khrunichev Khrunichev Space Research Center was told by the top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as an employee of the government apparatus.
"He has been working at the new post for several weeks," the interlocutors of Kommersant clarified in the industry.
Get a quick comment CENSC on Thursday failed, and Mr. Okhlopkov himself for comment was unavailable.
However, Kommersant's information was officially confirmed at the SCNC.
He made the decision to move to the position of Director for Production Coordination, - said at the enterprise. "Andrei Okhlopkov fully accomplished the task assigned to him to provide the starting minimum for the first launch at the Vostochny Spaceport.
Mr. Okhlopkov moved to work at the CENSCI in 2013, having a service in the space forces, in particular at Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" cosmodrome he held the post of first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Okhlopkov became a figurant of the criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: ostensibly from his submission, regional businessmen were paid for kickbacks of state orders, but they did not fulfill their obligations to clean up the detachable parts of the launch vehicles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Komi Republic.
In 2012 the jury found him innocent.
The responsibilities for technological development entrusted to him were extended to different projects, but the main one was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
Headed then the Federal Space Agency Oleg Ostapenko in an interview with Kommersant bluntly said that the situation on the East "was critical already in October 2013".
The matter is that when planning a strategic mistake was made: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 rocket was planned at the same time - the end of 2015.
To carry out the launch before the end of the year, the construction was completed six months earlier and the deadlines were removed from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, we had to go to the trick: the specialists of the Center for Standardization and Standardization began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment on unfinished facilities.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Okhlopkov.
Despite the risks that existed, and yet the transfer happened (instead of December 2015, the "Union" flew only on April 28, 2016), this idea proved to be justified, says a Kommersant source at the cosmodrome: "Otherwise, we would still not have launched a single launch from the East, but we would be engaged in construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversees the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkov his "space Susanin," but he almost always asked for information about the construction process.
I remember Mr. Okhlopkov and straightforwardness: for example, in an interview with Kommersant, he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroy) of the status of a sole performer in the East and work directly with subcontractors: "Why should we put all our eggs in one basket of Spetsstroy?"
This idea found support in the government.
Since 2017, CENCI has assumed the responsibility of the general contractor, in order to complete the construction and installation works at the launch and technical complex planned for the fourth quarter.
According to Kommersant's information, the reason for Okhlopkov's transition to a new job was disagreement with the management of the TsENKI regarding ways to complete the construction of facilities and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as methods of working with subcontractors.
"It was decided that it would be better for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
The employee of the government apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, it will not be easy to find him an equivalent substitute."
According to "Kommersant", this is not required: the post of the technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be scattered across the divisions of the Center for Economic Research.
In the music schools there will be a training program for two specialties
In the future, pupils of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties simultaneously.
According to Svyatoslav Golubenko, Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture, for this purpose it is possible to re-read the students with recurring disciplines, and to solve with the help of special grants the payment of other classes in the second specialty, RIA Novosti reports.
"The Ministry of Culture took this issue for control, and together with the expert community we will develop a mechanism that will allow us to master two specialties, but at the same time it will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during the "Nedetskogo conversation" Vladimir Putin with the children of the children's center "Sirius", a student Maria Andreeva said that she was forced to pay for repetitive subjects in the second specialty at the Central Music School at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told that she is studying violin and piano and has awards of competitions in both directions.
The head of state acknowledged her issue very topical and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian man who was climbing up the wall to a skyscraper
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian citizen, Cyril N., was detained, who climbed on the roof of a high-rise building, El Universal portal reported.
The incident occurred in Mexico City's capital.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, climbed over a three-meter fence into the territory of the Nestle office building complex and independently climbed onto one of his towers.
However, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
They detained the young man already on the roof.
Officers of the Ministry of Public Security sent him to the ground by helicopter.
After that, he was sent to the National Institute of Migration.
They find out whether the young man is lawfully on the territory of the country.
Meanwhile, a video with a young man climbing a high-rise has become popular on the Web.
Users called the young man a "spider-man."
As the media writes, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help ease the IBD.
Red meat and chocolate is considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent studies suggest the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of those who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases.
This incurable disease, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to mitigate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at the University of Washington have determined that the main amino acid of tryptophan protein promotes the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells in the intestine make sure that harmful microbes coming in with food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body and without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too violated in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have shown that in mice that have a certain bacterium in the intestine, there are increasing tolerance cells.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of protein - to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one kind of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the normal intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan was contained in the diet of mice, the more these immune cells they had. "
He suggested that the same would work in humans: the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet can contribute to a more tolerant and less inflammatory environment in the intestine.
Postdoctor Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganvas, studying a variety of immune-enhancing immune cells, found that in one group of experimental mice these cells were, and another group that belonged to the same line but was kept separate did not.
She suggested that the difference may be caused by the microbiome of the intestine of mice-the communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the intestinal cells of the mice were sequenced, and six species of bacteria were found present in mice that had immune cells but were absent in mice that did not have them.
Mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this kind of immune cells received L. reuteri, and the immune cells they had appeared.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers raised L. reuteri in a liquid medium and then transferred small portions of the liquid - without bacteria - to the underdeveloped immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan processing, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells also fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as in mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether byproducts of tryptophan from L. reuteri contribute to the development of cells in humans in the same way as in mice, but in people with inflammatory bowel disease, defects in genes associated with tryptophan have been found.
She says: "Perhaps the development of these cells we need to strengthen, since inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to an expansion of their population. "
According to Jose Mourinho, Manchester United hired a "genius" in the person of Nemanja Matic
"Manchester United" hired a "genius" in the person of Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut in the match against "Sampdoria" on Wednesday evening.
The player, purchased for 40 million pounds from Chelsea, started with a 2-1 victory in Dublin in the last pre-season United before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression as a midfielder, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke through when they pleased.
Nevertheless, since Matic did not take part in the pre-season tour of Chelsea in Asia, he seriously lacked preparation for the game, and he survived only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires refinement before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius is how he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him prepare sooner rather than later."
Just like Matic, his fellow new players Viktor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku started the game at Aviv Stadium when Mourinho started to form his main squad by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire first.
"I'm grateful to the club for getting three out of four," he added.
"I will rejoice even more if they get me four out of four, but they have already tried very hard for me."
Former leaders of the Social Democrats of Lithuania persuade them to stay in the ruling coalition
The former chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, the former prime ministers Algirdas Butkevicius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former Speaker of the Seimas from Social Democrats Ceslovas Jursens appealed to one-party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the "Parliamentary Gazette", due to friction with partners - the Union of Peasants and the "Greens" - the Social Democratic Party initiated a discussion whether to stay in the ruling coalition.
And the three senior experienced comrades appealed to one-party members with an open letter, which reads: "The disappointment of the party's comrades in the election results is understandable, but the coalition with the" peasants "has created for us even if not the easiest, but nevertheless conditions for further pursuing the goals of social justice, which, on our initiative, are envisaged in the government program, and to preserve the political dominance of the left center over the right parties."
According to former party leaders, in the discussion so far "the expression based on emotions has prevailed without specific arguments."
The authors of the letter are afraid that by their rash actions their party can lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Invalid Anton Mamayev was fined
The Moscow City Court mitigated the punishment for wheelchair user Anton Mamaev with four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Earlier, by the decision of the Timiryazevsky court, the convict was released from the remand center.
At the same time, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal because he organized robbery and kidnapping of a scooter from a former special forces soldier.
The Moscow City Court by its decision mitigated the punishment to Anton Mamayev to 200 thousand rubles in fine.
"Mamayev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the basis of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person must be brought to criminal responsibility," the press secretary of the Moscow City Court, Uliana Solopova, explained to Kommersant.
In this case, the court took into account the state of Mamaev's health, the actual circumstances of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which it is possible to impose punishment below the lowest limit.
As for Mamaev's assistant Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish any circumstances that would have been the basis for changing the severity category of the deed and changing the verdict.
Anton Mamaev himself said that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I'm disappointed with the decision of the court.
The only legitimate solution would be an excuse, intends to fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, did not rule out appealing the verdict at the cassation instance of the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the levers right up to the European Court of Human Rights," he told RIA Novosti.
Recall, a 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a criminal in the fall of last year.
The disabled person claims that he bought a scooter from a friend for 160,000 rubles to sell later.
However, the owners of the scooter, including the former spetsnaz fighter, said that the disabled person and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov took away their property from them, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in prison, and Anton Mamaev - to four and a half years in prison with serving his sentence in a general regime colony (under part 2 of Article 162 of the Criminal Code).
After the immobilized invalid was placed in the SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General's Office, the human rights commissioner under the president Tatyana Moskalkova joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from the remand prison by a decision of the same Timiryazevsky court.
The defense, in turn, appealed against the decision of the first instance in the Moscow City Court.
ONF will prepare a report on the environment for the president
The final "Action Forum" of the All-Russian People's Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told Izvestia and confirmed the head of the executive committee of the movement, Alexei Anisimov.
According to him, according to the results of the forum, "front-line soldiers" plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of the national ecology, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
Izvestia's interlocutors in the ONF note that the report to the head of state will contain "deep analysis" on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final forum of the ONF will be held in the fall.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined - as a rule, it adapts to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally attends key events of the ONF.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of proposals that were expressed and will be expressed at these events, we will also formulate systemic proposals for solving environmental problems, "the source in ONF told Izvestiya.
The co-chairman of the Central Staff of the Movement, Olga Timofeeva, who heads the State Duma's Committee for Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that "front-line soldiers" will report to the head of state on the work carried out in the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the "Action Forum" of the ONF are likely to be combined.
During the year we have grown into a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, have seen gaps in the legislation, and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be included in the report, which we prepare for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, "front-line soldiers" will report on the work on priority ONF projects, "Olga Timofeeva told Izvestiya.
According to her, Sergey Ivanov, special representative of the head of state on environmental protection, ecology and transport, will be invited to the forum.
Earlier, he had already participated in the work of the Media Foundation of ONF, which was held in April in St. Petersburg.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and most importantly, what needs to be done today is to launch environmental mechanisms to work for many years.
That these questions did not fall out of the agenda, - added Olga Timofeeva.
The head of the laboratory of the regional policy of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), Andrey Kolyadin, noted that by raising the environmental issues, the ONF is acting in line with the presidential agenda.
They offered many things as experts in various forums, and these initiatives received the president's support, "Andrei Kolyadin told Izvestia.
He stressed that today it is impossible to exclude the economic potential of the environmental agenda, which can give the regions an additional impetus for development.
Later, with the help of the ONF, the regions will be able to lobby not only the solution of their environmental problems, but also the development of ecotourism, "the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the garbage dump in Balashikha (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (a draft law on the prohibition of open transshipment of coal in populated areas, one of the authors - Olga Timofeeva) has been developed.
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal framework for resolving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the question is further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions made by the state, "says Leonid Bochin, head of the Ecology for All Charitable Foundation.
The member of the HRO, the head of the nongovernmental organization Greenpeace of Russia, Sergei Tsyplenkov, in his conversation with Izvestia stressed that a responsible approach to society and business is needed to successfully solve environmental problems, there is little legislative effort.
As soon as society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, "said Sergei Tsyplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that a violation of environmental legislation is an economically viable solution for business.
The British inventor implanted a microchip to hit the house and the car with a wave of his hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to install a microchip so that he could open the door of his house, go into the office and even start a car with a simple wave of his hand.
Thirty-four-year-old Stephen Northam implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger and now through his firm "Biotec" offers this service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist consultant from the Royal in Winchester, caring for the implantation procedure to be carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to the microchip that is implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company also replaces locks in homes and cars with those compatible with the chip at a price of £ 300 per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his car "BMW Z4", which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
Props for the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to the records of the armed forces provided to TIME magazine, the decision of the White House last month to bring a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers as much as $ 24,000.
The white-and-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the "Marine One" when the president is on board, was the central element of the July 17th White House event that showed US construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials inspected technological products from all of the fifty states.
A helicopter made in Connecticut was parked next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Squadron of Marine Corps Helicopters (HMX-1), the department responsible for helicopter control, the White House Military Department ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or "FRAGO", just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South lawn on the occasion of an "unusual" event.
"I just wanted you to make sure that you are aware of, because this is an unusual event widely publicized in the press," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 in an e-mail to his chief, the first deputy chief of aviation for the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter stated that the helicopter would arrive to the South Lawn at about 7 am on July 17 to attend the event scheduled for 3 pm and stay there until the lawn was released between 6 and 9 pm on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for a return flight in accordance with the restrictions on working hours.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the security officers of the unit remained near the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records received by TIME magazine, it remains unclear whether the second crew was required as a result.
The Hatch law prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the measure does not contradict this resolution.
"Among other things, we asked whether this was a violation of Hatch's law, and we were told that there was not," wrote the commander.
"It seems that you have nowhere to go," the deputy chief replied.
The event "Made in America" was announced by the White House as an official event, and Hatch's law did not apply to him.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the president made efforts to promote health reform, which was then in development in the Senate, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as "Marine One" and "Air Force One" for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are instructed to use them for travel.
But to ask them solely in the interests of photo opportunities is unusual.
Trump already became the subject of discussions in February, when the presidential plane drove in the background during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with reports of complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is delighted with the" Made in America "show, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials," said White House spokeswoman Lindsey Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington metropolitan area and on the South Lawn to train transportation of the president of the United States to the White House to within an inch.
When Trump in early July was at the G-20 summit in Germany, the HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight made for the event "Made in America" was credited to the crew on the basis of the necessary training flights for the month.
Helicopters of the unit that day also flew 11 extra hours in the framework of "non-resident tasks to provide support."
According to the White House, the taxpayers did not cover expenses for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of the company "Sikorsky" said that the company did not participate in organizing a helicopter demonstration on the South Lawn.
The HMX-1 does not keep account of the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent for the event.
But, according to the hourly rates of the Ministry of Defense for 2017 fiscal year, the rate of reimbursement of the Ministry of Defense for VH-3D is 24,380 US dollars per hour of flight.
The unit records that the time of the aircraft in the air was 30 minutes in each direction from its airfield at the Kuantico Marines air base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using the helicopter is much lower than this rate.
"Calculating the cost for taxpayers, based on the approximate refund rate, is completely wrong," says Walters.
"These approximate rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual appropriations."
According to a study conducted in 2015 by the RAND Corporation, the reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but, indeed, take into account the cost of fuel, services and costs specified in the contract.
At that time, the former White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, spoke out in defense of the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase things done in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to national security, and that there are, I presume, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose workplace depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, the creation of which has worked so hard for so many Americans.
Therefore, of course, it is absolutely appropriate to draw attention to this. "
It was unclear if Trump was cooperating with the helicopter, inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he was exactly sitting in the driver's seat in the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump contacted representatives of Sikorsky, joking with the press about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
Moscow will allocate grants for resuscitation departments of city hospitals
Every year grants "Saving Lives" will be allocated to resuscitation and intensive care units of the capital's medical clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the Yudin City Clinical Hospital.
During the examination of the clinic, he presented a letter of gratitude to the orthopedic trauma doctor Viktor Protsko, under whose supervision a complex operation was carried out to reconstruct the foot of the adolescent.
Sergei Sobyanin also talked about the decision to allocate grants annually to resuscitation and intensive care units of city clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the capital's mayor, the Yudin Clinical Hospital is today one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic received new modern equipment, allowing its doctors to conduct unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of Kolomna rural hospital.
Currently, the departments of the medical institution are designed to receive over a thousand patients.
In addition to resuscitation and hospital there are day offices.
The hospital employs 2,800 people.
The total area, occupying a medical clinic, is 23.7 hectares.
In February this year, the medical institution became a participant in the pilot project for the organization of short-stay hospitals (UPC).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which allows to significantly shorten the period of rehabilitation of patients.
After an operation in a hospital they spend only a few hours.
Only in the first six months of this year, in the Yudin clinical hospital, 36,000 patients were provided with inpatient medical care.
Medical staff of the clinic performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported the lack of buyers of Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported the absence of applications for the purchase of Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
This is on Friday, August 4, TASS reported citing a spokesman for the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017 a package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Victor Prokopeni for the approval of the indirect (through Paritetbank) acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank shares was withdrawn.
"Documents from other potential investors to buy shares of the Savings Bank in the NBU has not been received," the report says.
On August 3, the Belarusian businessman Victor Prokopenya withdrew his bid to purchase a subsidiary of Sberbank.
July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine denied Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov in the acquisition of Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that the businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for verification for compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian subsidiary to the consortium Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the "daughters" of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favor of parent organizations.
Trailer of the third season "Narco": in the popular series of the studio "Netflix" after the death of Pablo Escobar, the central role is played by the cartel Cali
Despite the fact that in the second season of "Narco" was disclosed the identity of the murderer Pablo Escobar, the series of the studio "Netflix" is far from complete.
Streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons are planned, and the third one was already represented by the first trailer, showing the villains of the upcoming show.
In the third season, the drug control agency's attention was attracted by the richest organization of drug dealers - the Kali cartel.
The organization, headed by powerful godfathers, works like a corporation on the Fortune 500 list, only with a lot of government bribery and acts of violence.
The cartel leader - Hilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar), Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) - her brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is responsible for relations with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz-Londoño (Pepe Rapasote) works in New York.
In the recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns to the role of Javier Peña, a character who is attracting US and Colombian law enforcement agencies to help in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matthias Varela, Michael Stal-David, Matt Wilan, Icel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Narco" will be released on the screens of the first of September.
Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can be representative only when all members of society, including women, participate in them, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Heisome, the current head of the UN mission on assistance to Afghanistan, hundreds of women run for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for the post of vice-president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women can not be overemphasized," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
The choice can be fully representative only when women participate in them fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Elections to provincial councils and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban threatens to disrupt the election process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from military operations to the role of advisers.
In the elections this year, the government for the first time passes peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Hayes said that increasing the role of women will contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
Prosecutor General's Office approved the indictment in the case of Nikita Belykh
The Prosecutor General's Office of Russia approved the indictment in the criminal case against the former governor of the Kirov region Nikita Belykh, accused of receiving a large bribe.

The materials were forwarded to the Presnensky District Court of Moscow for examination on the merits.
In Venice, tightened fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venetian authorities tightened fines for bathing in canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walks around the city in a swimsuit or with a bare torso will now be fined 200 euros.
For 100 euros will be demanded from those who will arrange a picnic in a public place or ride a bike in pedestrian areas, TASS reports referring to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide a fine for inscriptions on monuments of 400 euros and for garbage of 25 euros.
Inform tourists about the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice with the help of the special company "Enjoy, respect Venice" (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) in social networks, as well as through ads and posters on the city council website, on billboards and in the places where tourists gather most.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the counselor for tourism of Venice Paola Mar, the information on the fines will be transferred to the embassies of the home countries of the violators, in order to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she noted.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit the flow of tourists.
In Venice, there is already a successful restriction on the number of tourists visiting the city center.
Instead of 100,000 people wishing to watch the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 guests were admitted to the scene.
In addition, a moratorium has been introduced to create new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice.
Employees of the State Border Service in the first half of 2017 detained 272 illegal aliens on the border with the EU countries, in total 1,055 illegal migrants were detained.
This was reported in the State Border Service.
Of these, 314 people were detained for illegally crossing the border, and the rest - for violating the rules of residence of foreigners in Ukraine and other offenses.

The Federation Council on Wednesday supported the statement of the chairman of the committee for defense and security Viktor Ozerov and freed him from this post.
He remains a senator from the Khabarovsk Territory.
The statement with a request to release him from his post Ozerov wrote last week.
He explained his decision by the need for rotation and his desire to "change the rhythm of life."

Electricity is cheaper for both residents and commodity producers of Buryatia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) that lasted for more than a decade to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
Since September 1, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial customers has been reduced by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country established indicative prices for electricity and capacity for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia in accordance with the Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation "On Amendments to the Rules of the Wholesale Electricity and Capacity Market and the Consolidated Prognostic Balance Sheet of Production and Supply of Electric Power (Capacity) within the Unified Energy System of Russia for the Subjects of the Russian Federation" (dated July 17, 2017 No. 842).
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat commodity producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the life of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic have studded the thresholds of Moscow offices in vain attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with a cascade of hydroelectric power stations on the Angara flowing out of Lake Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buryatia.
And only this year began moving.
In March, tariffs for electricity for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles / kWh to 3.93 rubles / kWh, or by 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the list of territories of price zones of the wholesale market, for which the functioning of wholesale and retail markets are established, the turn of industrial consumers has come.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays for kilowatt / hour 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to name at least an approximate date for new tariff moves downward for Buryatia.

The National Union of Unqualified, Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment at the McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union requires guarantees from McVitie's biscuit manufacturer managers in connection with its long-term production commitment at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company ignored the issue of future investments at the Tolkros facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies, employs more than 500 people.
The company Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, said that over the past few years, has invested more than 5 million pounds in the facility.
The company adds that in case of any changes in the work of the facility, employees and representatives of the trade union "learn about them first."
In a letter to the head of the facility owned by the company, the Scottish branch of the GMB demanded from McVitie's reaction to the concern that funding would not be put on the modernization of production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "Our union members are deeply concerned that we can not get clarity from the general manager of the facility on business needs and an investment plan for the future of Tollcross."
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in the local society and on the territory of Greater Glasgow, this is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rising living wage and the chronic decline in production, the East End of Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of production at the McVitie's factory.
According to Pladis spokesperson, "The head of the Tolcro facility just received a letter from the GMB Scottish branch just yesterday and the company will respond immediately, as we value our continued cooperation with employees and union representatives."
Two months ago we held a regular meeting in Tolkross with employees and representatives of GMB, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We talked with employees that, like all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions - and this applies to all our facilities and activities - in order to remain competitive.
"In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tricros facility, especially in production lines and improving performance."
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and in case of any changes in the work at this facility, employees and representatives of the union will be the first to know about it. "
Putin said that the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the Cabinet should join the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNKhK), but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, like Rosneft.
So Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin's request to help resolve the contradictions that have arisen.
The head of state drew attention to the fact that the relationship between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for the VNKhH jeopardizes the project implementation period.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
Gazprom proposes to find gas resources from the perimeter of Rosneft, but we do not have such resources, Sechin added.
Recall that Rosneft asked to allow it to use for the Eastern Petrochemical Company gas from the Kirinskoye field of Gazprom, located on the shelf of Sakhalin.
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on this issue continue, and there are no "acute angles there."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neimar's transition three years ago?
A member of the La Liga can regret his interest in Marco Verrati
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop pursuing Neimar after the club has offered £ 189 million for his ransom, but have they warned Barcelona about the world record-setting strike that took place three years ago?
The sensational suggestion revived the summer transfer window when the League 1 club was ready to beat the world record for the cost of the transfer, more than double the previous mark associated with the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
When the transition is over, Neimar will become the most expensive player in the world, and the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of more than 500,000 pounds a week clean.
It is known that Barcelona and the fury of how the proposal was expressed, and how Neimar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as insisted by a source close to the leadership of the Catalan club, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But was not the football world warned about this possibility three years ago by the president of the "PSG"?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Mathewidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a stiff warning to every club that would like to lure one of the best PSG players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will oppose them, we will make suggestions to their players," Al-Heleifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they are waiting for the consequences. "
Apparently, "Barcelona" crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in the midfielder from the "PSG" Marco Verrati.
PSG made it clear that he would not let the Italian player of the team under any conditions, and now, probably, Barcelona feels the consequences of his proposal in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neimar.
