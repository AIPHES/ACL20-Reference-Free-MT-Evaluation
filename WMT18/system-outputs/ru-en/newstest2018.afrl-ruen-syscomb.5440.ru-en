Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on the introduction of administrative responsibility for violating the term and order of payment of goods (works, services) in carrying out purchases for state and municipal needs.
This law is intended to solve the very acute problem of non-fulfillment of its obligations by customers in the implementation of state and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation when entrepreneurs could not get paid under state and municipal contracts was ubiquitous.
At the same time, the Russian President instructed the Prosecutor General's Office to of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers, who concluded unfunded contracts, tried in every way to evade the assumed obligations on payment and included in the contracts illegal conditions.
The problem was the system in the whole country.
Since 2015, in the interests of protecting the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the prosecutor's office has made 9.7 thousand submissions, according to the results of their consideration, 4.5 thousand officials have been brought to disciplinary responsibility, to the administrative - 533, to the investigative bodies for the organisation of procedural inspections 75 materials are presented, 46 of them are initiated criminal cases.
As a result, the debt owed to entrepreneurs amounted to more than 66 billion rubles.
And these huge sums have accumulated far not as a result of non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
There have been numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs much more modest amounts.
Here is a typical case.
The head of a small company won a competition for services on social transport for several million rubles.
The man invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled the obligations, but put money in the time did not receive.
The result is a growing financial entity from wages, taxes,, which would lead to bankruptcy, if the entrepreneur did not apply for assistance from the prosecutor's office.
Now, in a number of regions, the problem has been solved as much as possible.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt on state and municipal contracts, revealed by prosecutors of subjects of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where the debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor's office works in a manual anti-crisis management.
The Attorney General personally conducts visiting meetings with representatives of the local authorities, where all the violations revealed by prosecutors and measures for their immediate elimination are in.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of the Federal Law № 189-FZ "On amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in terms of establishing administrative responsibility of the customer's officials customer for violation of the term and order of payment of goods (works, services) in procurement for state and municipal needs," which was signed last week by the President of Russia.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Prosecutor General's Office.
The new law will complement the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation, which provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by an official of the customer of the term and order of payment for goods, works and services in the state and municipal procurement.
And if an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he will be disqualified for a period of one year to two years.
All prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation have already received instructions to ensure the application of these legislative innovations in practice.
Civil Rights Group announced a motion to move to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to colored people travelling in Missouri because of state discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "A warning to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on African American travelers, guests and citizens of Missouri to be particularly attentive and to exercise heightened caution when travelling around the state in connection with a number of questionable racist incidents that have recently occurred throughout the state and brought here ».
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, to announce a warning on the movement of the group prompted recently enacted Missouri law, which made it harder for people to win claims related to discrimination, as well as the fact that the state law enforcement agencies disproportionately choose their targets minorities.
Thus, people are subjected to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of the skin, they are beaten and killed, "said Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Color Population of Missouri.
« We hear complaints often as never before. "
This is the first warning of this kind, announced by the organization in relation to the U. S. state.
The group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ended up with the and Missouri police arrested him without charge for a crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report from the Missouri General Prosecutor's Office that the likelihood of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 percent higher than for whites.
The aim of the warning is to ensure that people are aware of the situation and warned their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri Majlis, "said.
"People should be prepared in one way or another, whether they will take the money for collateral or inform relatives that they are traveling through the territory of the state."
According to the FBI's latest report on hate crimes, there were 100 hate crimes in Missouri for 2015, making the state the in the state in the state.
Also, a motion to move is a response to the new Missouri law, after which it will be harder to a case against a legal entity in relation to housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties (ACLU) announced warnings for traveling in Texas and Arizona after these states adopted new immigration control laws, according to which local law enforcement agencies were to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which, according to the ACLU, was to increase the number of racial checks.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department to other countries, but public organizations have recently resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Two people died as a result of the shooting on a police patrol in Egypt
Unidentified gunmen fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reports with reference to the Egyptian Interior Ministry.
During the two people, including one policeman, were killed three people were injured.
All the injured were taken to hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on the law enforcement.
One of the attackers was detained, the second managed to escape.
Rosturrism supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-refundable airfare
The head of Rostourism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with RBC TV channel that "positive" refers to the adoption of the law on the abolition of free baggage allowance in case of non-refundable air tickets.
"It is necessary to create conditions under which the person who has no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has luggage," - he stressed (quote on TASS).
At the same time Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the concerns of citizens, it is to pay for clothes and mobile phone in hand luggage will not have to.
"It would be right to appease all our citizens and tourists and claim to this, to say that it is to the top clothes, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the iceberg or even the computer will not have a relationship," - said the head of Rostourism.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law stipulating the right of airlines to exclude a rule on free baggage transportation in case of a non-refundable air ticket.
It means that airlines can determine the number of seats and weight of the luggage included in the non-refundable tariff.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate Baikal pollution
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the protection of Baikal reported that in recent years significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to identify sources of funding, plans and performers to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin also instructed to carry out full recultivation of contaminated areas.
"It is necessary to understand and with objects that continue to work here, the treatment facilities of most of them are worn out," - quotes the president quoted RIA Novosti as saying.
He also added that the Russian Prosecutor General's Office should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the area of the lake there are problems related to the emergence of natural landfills and a number of environmental violations by the organizers of the holiday.
"I want to emphasize this: not all in a row to check, here too the measure needs to know, but it is precisely - illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Earlier, the General Prosecutor's Office reported on the reduction of fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed an increase in the number of objects falling under environmental supervision.
Recall, on June 15, Vladimir Putin during a direct line, said the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of a special protection regime.
The residents of Olkhon Island, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory, told about the problems with conducting economic activities.
Head of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment Sergei Donskoy immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the water protection zone of Baikal, but in the government of Buryatia recalled that such a change is not enough, because the restrictions are related to a number of regulatory acts.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by changing the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
In Yugra there will be a new church
In the village of, members of the community of the indigenous peoples of the North "Rahtynya," together with the residents of Berezovsky district, take part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location - the river bank, the temple will be well visible from afar, so it will serve as a travel beacon for the fishermen.
According to the representatives of the community, the construction works will be completed this year.
Igrimskaya REB fleet provided transport support.
The church is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, as it is venerated by the Orthodox Church as the patron saint of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosów, fishing gives settlers work, feeds them.
Local residents wait for the temple to open its doors, and children even write in school books about it as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why do Singapore comply with laws?
I talk to the local businessman Chang, sitting in a snack bar in the open air.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, and burns neatly into his office with an iron box.
After the end of the conversation the businessman goes to the nearest urn - to her hundred meters - and throws out there bulls.
The fine for garbage in a public place - 500 local dollars, reports Chang.
You know, I have at the childhood simply reflex worked out: it is impossible to throw a fantik from a candy on a pavement, instantly will be fined.
And now there are video cameras everywhere.
And indeed - the sidewalks of Singapore in the centre of the city are pure, as if in a museum.
Chang says: three months ago, the 18-year-old son of his neighbor painted a graffiti wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced to.
What?!
Imagine.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on the buttocks and spent a week in prison.
In general, corporal punishment is not uncommon.
As in Singapore combines the highest standard of living and the incredibly harsh laws, the "AIF" columnist was on the spot.
Here nobody thinks to abolish the death penalty, - explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long spied on the views of both the European Union and the US on this matter.
If a person runs a large batch of drugs or trades them - he is put in a.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi airport.
He was defended by the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders, and even Pope.
However, the guy eventually hung.
After that the drug couriers our country diligently bypass.
The point is: in Singapore, it is assumed that the laws are bound to comply with ALL in a row, not just modest and rich people.
No matter who you are - a, vice-premier, a well-known artist or a resident of the European Union.
The option in this case is one: if you find half a kilo of cocaine, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you meet signs with a bunch of warnings, you are - how many in this city-state bans!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly according to the prescription (!) doctor.
The tourist will not give up the at the arrival, but it is worth sticking to the "rubber" in the metro, and will pay a fine of 1 thousand local dollars.
For four days I met two people with white tables on the neck: "I'm rubbish."
In addition to the fine, the in addition to the fine are often sentenced to a "link to the palaces": a week to clean parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles is by the "criminal," who forgot to wash away the water in the public toilet, and when trying to the small need in the elevator of the apartment building a special detector - blocked doors and sent a signal to the police.
Among the very exotic laws - bans on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive watering of the room plant (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires smokers can't be allowed to carry lighters in the metro, otherwise they will be fined 5,000 Singaporeans.
In general, there is a thought: as far as I'm concerned, it is necessary to something disturbs something.
This is not the case, "the owner of the local travel agency.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and for the past twenty years I have not seen that for their violation have attracted.
Why are they saved?
So that the citizens do not relax.
The main rules follow the strict rules.
For example, if a minor is sold in a cigarette kiosk, they will be punished all along the chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the will receive blows sticks on the "back," and the seller will also be and in jail.
It is thanks to such harsh laws offence in Singapore are very rare.
Is it justified?
In the seventies we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, travelled as wanted, sat drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of fines for the year everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having drunk a portion of whisky, knows: if you stop, the policeman will not release for a bribe, will impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and for years will be put behind bars.
Many foreigners in the South East Asia seem to be a type of concentration camp.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the Death Penalty" - a guest from the United States was horrified by the general wealth of the, "frighteningly clean airport" and "cultural nature."
Say, such things are unnatural, look artificially, and so in principle shouldn't be.
The first days in Singapore and rightly afraid to throw paper on the sidewalk, you catch, if came in the metro with ice cream.
But then come to the area "Little India," and suddenly - "break": the bus stop rolls plastic cups.
"How is it?" you wonder.
А вот так, - усмехаются Singaporeans.
Everyone happens.
Not for every such "crime" they grab on the spot, but you have to know: if you calculate you will not - because you have broken the law.
Most often it is enough that the person behaved normally.
Of course, power in Singapore is entirely authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Ho Chi Minh City I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often pick up smartphones and cameras.
In the center of of Paris is full of dirty bombs and.
On our streets, too, not everyone tries to throw garbage in the ballot box.
Singapore, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to death) laws, has become the most quiet, clean and secure city on Earth.
I think.
Such is human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one was stuck behind the wheel, until they began to.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with the laws.
And it is necessary to think, at in Russia people too would be glad clean streets, lack of garbage in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with a public toilet.
Here are corporal punishment - thank you, not.
In other words, Singapore's laws are at least worth looking at.
Nothing holy?
Now Trump's White House has targeted the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he starts fighting statues.
Americans understand this no worse than all the rest - hence the deliberately theatrical demolition of a statue of Saddam Hussein FIRDOS Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of Trump's key ideologues, knew no doubt what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a violent dispute with CNN journalist Jim Akostal about the President's proposals for a sharp decline in legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't attack the statue itself. "
The of the recreational boat owners and artists representing the Statue of Liberty would have lynched him if he tried to do it.
But he attempted at its meaning, and especially on the sense that was her assigned to it in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument when on the podium Emma Lazarus were added.
As Miller lashed out at Acosta: "I don't want to go deep into history, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that the world.
The poem you're talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller correctly laid out the facts, but as he himself said, it really is not about history.
This is about the current sounding of the striking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "your tired, your poor, / your crowds, dreaming to breathe freely, / Unless the waste of your abundant shores."
Never again have "accidents" been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't did not engage in literature - he made it clear that in Trump's America these people are not waiting.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, to put her words on the of the statue after her death - knew very well that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the link between the French and American republics with the help of the banal classical figure - the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a totally different name: the of the Exiles.
The combination of the poem and the image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack against American nativism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right though to change it back.
The cumbersome Rash Limbo, a sort of John the Baptist who heralded the coming of Trump, in 2010 argued that Freedom invites no one, rather, it is an early neoconservative, bearing the flame of America lying in the darkness of the world: "freedom goes forward.
It carries a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch needs not to light the way in the US. "
Against the habit of Limbo here really got to the point.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement Lazarus was to see her as it would have seen exhausted, unhappy, but full of hope people on the of ships after long and often heavy swimming.
This means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue meets them with the words of hope and hospitality they dream of.
And, of course, this is not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their torch needs not to illuminate the way, but to stir up hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
The World Championship 2017: Neil Blake highly assesses Scottish members of the UK team.
Eilid Doyle recalls the time when in the UK national team there were only two Scots
Neil Blake, director of the game of the UK Athletics Federation, said that consisting of 16 people, the Scottish part of the team in the World Cup will make a "significant contribution to the team's game."
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for the 2017 London Championship starting on Friday.
Blake believes that Scotland is "born something special" and the UK Athletics Federation should take this into account.
"We know this and try to understand and we will support, as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
"I have spoken with people at the Institute of Sport Scotland, and they think that it is due to what they did.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that with what they have done, it is necessary to work.
The British Athletics Federation: with what they have done, it is necessary to work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why circumstances unfolded, but it is absolutely brilliant. "
Some of the Scottish athletes claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachet, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 metres; and Eilid Doyle has chosen his captain.
"Eilid modestly.
Her captain's speech was superb, "says Blake.
"Many athletes, whether they are Scots or not, and from where they live or train, came out of this room, feeling the pride and mood to win.
Eilid's passion and sincere feelings were remarkable. "
The owner of a silver medal of the Commonwealth championship which in the fifth World Cup will run distance of 400 m with obstacles, says that 16 Scots in the British national team is "incredibly."
The previous record for the number of Scots in the World Cup was equal to seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Ahead goes Laura Muir, who specializes in the-distance race and hit five British and two European records last year.
It will run for and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will take part in the 1500 m race, is another Scotchman to pay attention to: behind his back he has a successful season, in which there were victories at the qualifying competitions of the British national team and at the Annual competitions.
Doyle recalls his first World Cup, when in addition to the only on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her countrymen not only entered the national team, but in some cases will qualify for a medal and fight for the in the.
"The captain of the national team is chosen by other members of the team, so it in any case was a huge honor, but to know that your comrades voted for you and you chose, - for me it is absolutely special thing," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud for all Scots who entered the national team.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they all - the athletes who will seek to get on the podium.
What about my captain's speech?
Yes, I think she was not bad.
I've just noticed that we are very lucky to host the World Championships.
So it's just about how important it is to receive support from fans and take advantage of the fact that we again in the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to get into his arena and take part in competitions, and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful. "
Facebook critics: don't have to public office unless you are ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood that such a critical press.
Americans loved George Washington, but this prevented them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism of it, of course, was annoying.
But he didn't touch his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said: "it is possible to take away the freedom of speech and us, deaf and dumb, will lead like sheep to the slaughter."
Now I will go to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should have tried to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased the posts of a minimum of 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him.
Subordinates of the governor called this lawsuit insignificant, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "well and."
"It's just Facebook," many say.
But this is also important.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is a remarkably popular Republican governor in the democratic advantage of the state.
It is in second place in the country's approval rating among the 50 governors.
Is not a sophisticated reactor.
He demonstrated a firm hand in the management of the state and adherence to its principles.
He also enjoys Facebook as the primary way of communication with his voters and with jokes demonstrates on his page his bald after chemotherapy head.
Therefore, to block people who come to the governor's page - which is declared as an official public forum and conducted by employees of the administration on taxpayers' money - it is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with Washington Post, press secretary Amelia Chees defended the actions of the governor, claiming that blocking comments is simply their moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and, on the Internet.
"Post" talked to some of the real people whom Hogan blocked.
And it is real people, not, - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor, who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, meaningful and not rude.
Pastor cited the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan is a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramana of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I am disappointed by the lack of his reaction to hate crimes and other news," she wrote in the comments section of the Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say that this is a so-called twist, rather than admitting that dealing with a large group of disaffected citizens."
What subordinates of the governor call "concentrated spam attack," others probably would call "active life position."
In the era of Facebook, it's easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
This is much less dusty than before, when it was necessary to send people, collect and burn newspapers with critical outsiders, or arrest and the protesters.
But this is exactly what is happening now, only in the figure.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been in his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
In the opinion of the U. S. District Judge of the United States of Alexandria James C. Chereris, the chairman of the supervisory board of the county of Loudon violated the First Amendment, having amused the voter in his account in Facecbook.
And in Kentucky, the Republican governor Matt Babin, has been charged by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the era of affordable postal spending made roughly the same coup as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew fourfold, and the authors of anonymous letters severely damaged his authority.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms ",", "" "and" Porcius "wrote letters to newspapers, the Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the online project "Documents George Washington", his office was filled with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty on Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he did not try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speeches lies at the very of our state.
And true leadership means agreeing with this.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for everyday amenities at the Club of the Renaissance club
Former European champion Roland Rafferty is hoping for household convenience for the next three days, when the Renaissance club in East Lotiana will host the twenty-fifth outdoor Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
A native of Northern Ireland, who was leading in the next door to the club, Archerfield Links, and moved in the direction of the final round last year, until lost to Paul Ilsu, attached to the new place and the role of the tournament representative on behalf of the club's founder and director Jerry Sarvadi.

This is a great demonstration for this field. "
The Englishman ILS eagerly expects the opportunity for the first time to defend a champion title, despite the fact that for his 32-year career won both in the European tournament, and in the European Challenge Tour tournament.
Thus it is really a special feeling of slander, "said the player from Southport.
"I wasn't able to try to win the Extrmadura Open, because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
It is magical to return to this corner of the world.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back, and for me and my wife Sharon, it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time, and we will always remember it.
Returns to fight in the native land, Gary Orr, who has joined the European tournament for older athletes after earlier this year to it turned 50.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always a little more important," said resident of Helensboro Orr.
"You want to perform well, but you feel this extra burden."
I played with great pleasure again and I showed good golf.
I am satisfied with how everything so far turns out.
On the field to this trio will be joined by the former winner of the tournament Nebuchadnezzar Masters Ian Wood and champions majors for the elderly athletes Paul Broadway, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNamty.
ORR and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Steven mccalster, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drammond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs 5 pounds per hour if one person is in the car, and 10 pounds if the person is two and more.
All proceeds go to the British prostate cancer fund.
British roads learn to absorb harmful emissions
Distinctive tunnels over highways capable of absorbing carbon oxide vehicles are already being tested on Britain's roads.
The country's transport agency, as reported by Autocar, reported positive results of a 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highway in the north of the of the country.
The 6 metres tunnel is built from some of the latest polymeric materials that are capable of absorbing harmful substances contained in automobile exhaust.
However, the creation of a whole network of similar tunnels is only part of the massive measures that the UK authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic, expand the use of commercial transport on electric traction and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all atmospheric pollution comes from transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
The Moscow City Court changed the punishment of disabled Mamaev for a fine

It is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office asked the court to replace the deadline for the conditional, explaining its request that Mamaev's disease "his finding in prison conditions."
28-year-old Anton Mamayev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with imprisonment in a penal colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces fighter.

Poverty and death in Indonesian golden land "
Preparing lunch, Bardin Degey does not enjoy the stove.
It is very rare.
In its wooden house in, the capital of the district of in the rebel Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply places a sweet potatoes, which is called the Kuwaiti note, right in the hearth.
After half an hour, the crazed strawberries get in and eat impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the ground floor of the furniture, and it is here that of the furniture she does not have.
There is a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of the four wives of her husband, and therefore she was not instructed to work in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late may be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and still soldiers.
"Nobody decides to walk around the village after five o'clock," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, by raising hands in front of the occupying troops.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, without allowing foreign journalists and human rights activists.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
The city as remote as the abandoned; the road here includes a half-hour flight from Jayapura, the administrative center of the province, in Nabir, and then a five-hour shaking on a car.
There is no public transport.
The city, with a population of about 19,000, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; the roofs of corrugated steel painted rust in a variety of red shades.
There were few Indonesians, not to mention journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, MEE Pago had been worshipped by God by the name of Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"It was unusual for us to wear this garment," he says, showing his bright, hand-woven turban, a dark skirt and a bright shirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on the body."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, 28% of its population lives below the poverty line, and infant mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it is also the Indonesian golden land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine,, which is located in Phoenix's Freeport McMoRan, is just sixty miles from Panai, a high-altitude province of the New Jersey, where 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, the company had produced gold and copper of approximately $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua boasts forest reserves valued at $78 billion.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful armed forces retain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation by the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local servicemen and units nearly $20 million, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
Demands greater autonomy on the part of the Papuans threaten the existence of this golden sinew and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, since 1969, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacres in Papua indigenous highlands in the seventies can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesia's police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We will lose everything," a report published in 2016 by the Brisbane Diocese contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture - particularly as stated in another report, rape and an electric shock - and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because accidents take place every week," says Andreas Harsono, who is investigating Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The nuts tightened as Papua's resources attracted the influx of migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
The 3.5-year-old population of the province is 83% composed of Christians, but demographic figures change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
The Javanese benches, which are cooked by the, sell fried chicken and a mixture of vegetables.
Local residents are trying to withstand competition.
"Migrants started in the traditional market to sell chicken and vegetables cheaper than the natives of Papua," explains Abet You, a twenty-four-year-old native of Panai who moved to Jayapura, the province's administrative centre, because of work.
"This is the natives of Papua - mum mom (women) of Papua - have lost their market."
President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, has vowed to address inequality and rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On their way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter secured support from 27 of Papua '29 districts, including Panai.
But in Papua, almost nothing has changed, and locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014, we voted for Jokowi, expecting him to fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," says.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Jokowi Paniai suffered a tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street and sang Christmas hymns at a in Earotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle pulled out of the darkness.
Frightened children told them that they should be to use headlights.
According to local pastor Javed Tabai, one of the soldiers was offended on their tone and after some time returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and witnesses, the soldiers who were drunk were chasing children and beating them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot and killed a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julian Eimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later someone was set up the government building of the electoral commission, and the next day the situation escalated.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and executed Vayta, dance of the Papasian tribe MEE Pago: ran circles and portrayed bird singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and the military base.
When the situation escalated, the soldiers were given an order: "if the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," so he sounded, as stated in the official document, which saw the correspondents of the magazine, but which has was not been published in the local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Yerevan Kayama, head of the district of Kon Koto in, felt the approach of danger and called for calm, turning to the crowd with a request to go to the houses.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned, my left wrist suddenly hit by a bullet," he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayama still doesn't know who gunned down, but says that the bullet flew by the side of the assembled soldiers.
Thus there was a crowd, shots were a lot, "he adds.
The local resident of Alfius Jouva got three times, says his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him."
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.
General Jotja Mende, Senior Inspector of the Papua Police, told reporters that his officers were merely defending their base because she was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten us to kill us," said Papua Commissioner Pujo Sulaliyo, a police spokesman, in 2015.
"It is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch « » five young protesters were killed, and many more were wounded.
The of the killings reached Jakarta just the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a fervent speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical abuse of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be settled immediately so that it will never be repeated again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security Affairs Viranto said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical violations of human rights.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
Most of the violations occurred long ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or early zero.
The point is that we certainly want to address these violations, but there are procedures that need to be, "he said.
Then Viranto relinquished his words, to the magazine "TIME" on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he had no plans to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said: "will be decided through the court."
, Whom the United Nations accused of committing crimes against humanity in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during a bloody vote for the independence of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims met such statements with grim mistrust.
"Over the past three years, I have been asked me four times, but there has been absolutely no change," said Johannes.
"I was tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm terrified," he says.
"I'm afraid that I will be arrested by the military."
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the inhabitants of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military officers came behind me," he says.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in neighbouring Panay district of.
During a clash between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help bring a man unconscious to the hospital, one man was killed and 17 others were wounded, including children.
The man, 20-year-old Ravianus Dove, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of a construction site owned by the company.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the officers, who responded with warning shots.
But local residents claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) began shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retaliation," the twenty-nine-year-old Dominggu Badiya, who lives near the hospital and saw him hurriedly delivered to the wounded, told the magazine "TIME."
"I was hiding at home two days."
The Deiai parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to, and the mobile police brigade withdrew from the region.
Panayai has always been a sore place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development is dismayed by the of the,, and damal scattered throughout the area covered by the greenery of the central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papua by engaging in sporadic attacks and kidnapping attacks on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM executives come from Paniai, including Tadius Yoga and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a response in recent years in, thousands of people have been arrested and unreasonably detained by the military under the pretext of protecting national independence.
Some never returned.
Among the population of Papua Paniai is considered to be a sad, forgotten place. "
Poverty strengthens discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in the is too expensive for local residents.
Bread is equally unaffordable.
People here grow everything they eat: basically a note, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of which can care for four-five fields of sweet potatoes.
Usually they retain most of the harvest for the family and the rest is sold on the local market.
The ten clubs note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, there has been an increase in economic inequality between indigenous Papuans and new migrants, who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nabir airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually delivered to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Pubs rarely have enough money or necessary skills to their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there is neither work nor money," says John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Esküdi and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for lack of coherence with relevant organizations, despite the fact that they were granted rare video permits.
According to Felix Keane, Asia's deputy director for Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the Jjovi campaign to reverse the restrictions on media work in order to promote transparency and development have not been met.
Now foreign journalists trying to report from the insurgent eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and Western Papua, face new dangers: denial of visa and blacklisting, "he said in a statement.
The lack of attention from the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states, Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands, appealed to the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the various and widespread violations in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramanat Nasir, dismissed the group's statement, telling journalists in Jakarta that "there is still a democratic system in Indonesia and there is a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations."
Local residents want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights Kiisa Van Baar, visited Jayapur on 4 May, local residents broke the silence, praying: "we want freedom, as the source, who also attended the meeting, but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.
He is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Paniai, "says Gobai, chairman of the tribe's council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai, except that they live in the shadow of a threat from the an almighty army, are mired in poverty, and education and health care are in a miserable state.
Gobai says that the residents of Panai, like other Papuans, consider their voice, given to Jokowi, the to pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly in front of the police and military section.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they at least will not allow guilty to forget about their crimes.
They killed a member of our family, "Jacobus says, without raising her head.
"What else were we to do?"
A fire for the second time covers the Dubai non-bobbed Torch
The fire swept one of the world's highest residential non-skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to leave the-nine-storey construction of in 337 meters embroidered.
This is the second fire, a high-rise building, which by coincidence is called "The torch" - in two years.

The government said it was working to provide shelter to the victims.
The incident may bring back to the agenda the safety of materials used in the of high-rise buildings around the world.
In the course of the investigation by the administration of Mr. Fakhel, after a fire there in 2015, it was found that the external panels used for decoration and isolation were most affected.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that it believed that the insulation system and the cladding panels of the Grenelle Tower building in London could accelerate the spread of the fire that occurred there in June, killing about 80 people.

The reason of mass fight in the Uruguayan military center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Elan Training Center, where a mass fight took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this massacre have already become known.
According to the newspaper Mash, which appeared on the page "," the contractors of the Ural military unit number 31612 brutally fought because of the unfilled bed.
It all started with the fact that the ordinary, named Sayan, demonstratively ignored an the order of the officer to fill the torchable sheet.
On the side of the officer stood soldiers from the sixth company.
Sayana supported the first company.
For half an hour, 140 young guys crushed in the barracks of the bed and sink, and the glass.
More than ten people were injured in the mass fight.
In the CSO refuted the information about поножовщине.
The study found that no less than one fifth of passengers in the U. S. carry prohibited items into the plane.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers deliberately or accidentally carried in luggage on board of the plane through the inspection of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration prohibited items, including a minimum of 6 percent were in the plane, while under surveillance carrying prohibited knives or other sharp items.
Almost 1 percent reported that they later discovered that they accidentally had firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The study, conducted by the charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and covering more than 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers are more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to fly with what is prohibited by the ATB, 19.7 percent were milenials compared to less than 15 percent of of Generation X.
By the ATB staff often sneaked food and water.
More than 3 per cent of respondents admitted that they had specially carried through the inspection of sharp objects, and 2.2 per cent of respondents - and 3.7 per cent of respondents - men admitted that deliberately carried into the plane prohibited medicines.
The company said that it studied passengers across the country to find out how many of them accidentally carried smuggling through inspection at airports, and how many did it consciously.
It is quite expected that the most often - consciously or unconsciously pulling smuggling through inspection those who fly the most.
As the company, ATB rules are quite complex and confusing.
People often don't know exactly what fluids they can carry and in what quantities.
It is therefore not surprising that most of what the ATB selects is forbidden liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could be considered forbidden to carry the book.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not international.
EPA chief Püitt refuses to delay the implementation of Obama's rules on reducing emissions
The day after the 15 states, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to delay the implementation of Obama's rules designed to reduce emissions of air pollutants and lead to smog formation.
Pruitt explained his decision by the fact that now his agency is more than under previous administrations, listening to the needs of the environmental regulators of individual states.
He made no mention of the lawsuit against his previous position filed in the federal appeals court.
The dispute turned around the deadline on October 1, which states should ensure compliance with the 2015 standards of on ozone at ground level.
In June, Prüitt announced that he would postpone their observance for one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "inconsistencies local decisions or obstacles to economic growth."
Pruitt, who before being appointed by President Trump to his current position, was the attorney general of Oklahoma, was long known as a consistent opponent of tightening environmental norms.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of norms opposed by the chemical or gas industry.
An unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat for the of a return to the previous norms.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA exceeded its powers, trying to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Prüitt suggested that, having dramatically changed the course regarding ozone standards, he simply exercised the EPA's duty to cooperate with the states in a comprehensive process of timely implementation of the new standards.
"In previous administrations, EPA often couldn't meet the deadline, then waited for lawsuits from activist groups and other and discussed deadlines in the settlement of the case," - said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against EPA in his previous post.
"We don't believe in regulation by litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We are also serious about our charter and the power it gives us. "
However, in a statement, the EPA said that could at some point again use his "powers to delay and other data law" to ensure that the norms "jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all the information available."
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader revision of ozone regulations.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneider, who led a coalition of states filing this week filed a lawsuit against the EPA, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
"The EPA's change of course - after our lawsuits - is an important victory in the fight for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who directly affect their cities," said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
Ozone at ground level occurs when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, refineries and chemical plants and other sources enter the atmosphere in response to with sunlight.
Arising from this could cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health advocates and environmentalists welcomed the unexpected shift of the.
"It's sad to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this perfectly logical step from a person who is charged with protecting the air we breathe," said Laurie Ann Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."

The principal - a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin strip - dragged cigar and looked through the windshield.
Sitting inside were shaking with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" cried a. "
"Throw him out of the car!"
Pierced cries broke the silence when a young black man pulled from the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a.
But when on the neck "Roger" a loop, almost all of the audience, and really caught breath.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the bridge Morse Ford Bridge to the night when, in 1946, two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey - were lynched.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It is astounding that for all these years, no one has been arrested - although we see them next to - though we know who they are," says Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the staging.
"It's a stain on our history and it is a stone on our souls."
The 71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Georgia Congress who has been fighting for human rights throughout his life.
For him, the performance is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to Monroe residents that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want investigation, we want to complete, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he says.
"We cannot go to healing and reconciliation until we achieve justice."
The coroner covers the body of one of the victims of lynching at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI filings obtained by BBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of participating in the lynching.
But no one has been charged.
Although the suspects remained at liberty for decades, human rights activists say the city's have always been well aware of the two linked motives of: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ruling for the first time allowed black citizens to vote on the primaries, which were to take place that summer.
Around the time of the same election, according to FBI reports, black explorer Roger Malcolm struck in a fight with a knife Barnett Hester, a white landowner - visibility, for women.
Brooks says that, according to be in the city, Hester slept with his wife Malcolm Dorothy, and that the child she was supposed to give birth was not from her husband.
According to the FBI reports, on July 25, 1946, Lay Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 to lure Malcolm out of prison.
He went to jail along with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove from prison and to Mores Ford Bridge, a crowd of lynchers surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and commanded the murders of Harrison," such a conclusion is made in one of the FBI reports.
"It is also clear that there has been collusion between law enforcement agencies of the state and the city, which not only took part in the killings, but also destroyed the evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an assassination attempt," he says.
"They are all killed to send a signal to blacks in the city: if you register and vote, you will be the same."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Green has been directing an annual performance that the lynching at Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is, he captures the viewer and tells about the deep racism, which, as many would like to take it, there is no more in America.
It's hard to watch and even harder to turn away, but Green believes that is the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own ugliness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I've experienced."
The rehearsal of this year's performance began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of the black - gathered in the room and listened to the polished play for years.
Wade Marbo was a director along with Green.
For several years played the role of the main member of the clan, but said that the role never became easier.
"It seems to me that I'm hooked because it's not the person that I am," Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at that time."
In the, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Ravenna, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
Spectal begins with the fact that Malcolm, enraged by the fact that Hester sleeps with his wife Dorothy, screams and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
The in response.
A blow is.
And at the same moment, all (at least, all black actors) are being torn apart.
Green laughs louder than everyone.
"What is" - asks Ascona.
He is concerned and confused.
I?
"No," says Green through laughter.
"I just don't think whites were saying'begga '."
"Yes yes," one of the black performers laughs.
"You have to be a 'r'."
And so the energy in the room changes: the discomfort is replaced by a sense of partnership.
Everyone must do everything right, not just for the sake of plays, but for the sake of the memory of the four murdered people.
The scene starts at first.
This time, when Ravenna says the word "n," it turns out to be clear and sharp.
Not a single person laughs.
The performance ends violently and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of actors and performs a sad song by Billy Holiday "Strange Fruit."
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
In a hundred yards from it half a hundred viewers wipe out tears and sweat.
Among the audience almost an equal number of black and white.
One couple came from Itaka, to see the performance; many live close by.
They are all suffered for almost eight hours the heavy stranglehold of Georgia while Brooks led them to on a pilgrimage to the graves of and Dorsey.
Until then, the remained only history, but now, when they are at the same place where people were lynching, it seems that their ghosts are in the air.
When the last note of the song hits, Green invites people to look closer and examine the body.
Children bend to their heads, touch the paint depicting blood, and immovable bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later Green thanked the audience, and suddenly everything ends.
The actors drop the ropes from the neck and wipe out the tears.
Bradshaw huts Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main puppet.
Nick Split hugged two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls in their embrace: emotional load of the performance finally struck him.
"Everything is fine," whispers one of the women.
"We know that your heart is good.
You had reasons for this. "
Later, the audience sit down with the actors.
At one table a white couple from Atlanta is busy discussing the with the black couple they have just met.
Deniz Daplinski is courting words to describe what she feels after the performance.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, scary words, and the actions of people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think that the lynching still happens," she adds, "only now it is called that the police are shooting."
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who recalls his work as a human rights, was in the spotlight.
He says he has already started planning for the next year.
"The performance inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us,," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it. "

New test results to assess the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden
The latest test results asylum-seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested were assessed as persons over 18 years, but not all trust the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) began tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make an assessment of the age of asylum process more accurate, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to identify the age of some refugees who claimed that they were minors.
Currently, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests between the middle of March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of the tested were rated as people 18 years or older, and under 25 cases, the forensic medical agency assessed that it was "probably a person 18 years or older."
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was probably less than 18. "
Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of a person is questionable.
According to Johan Geransson of the forensic medical agency, the results are consistent with the results of the past months.
We don't see a big difference with statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate, - he said to the portal "The Local Government."
The high proportion of cases estimated to have reached 18 years of age does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of the 581 test and reported that in 442 cases it is likely that the age of the test is 18 years or more. "
However, having considered 581 published results, the newspaper "Svenska Dagbladet" has found that in 243 cases, the person openly stated that the 18 th is executed this year.
The method of medical assessment of age, which is to make x-ray of wisdom teeth and tomography of knee joints and give them for analysis to dentists and radiologists, also drew criticism in some instances.
One of the is an endocrinologist from the Carolina Institute Claude Marcus, part of whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have passed through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I had reasons to think about this, and I don't think it's necessary to use the measuring methods that are used now.
The biological age is thus very inaccurate.
If we can't determine it with certainty, we should not pretend that we can, "he told the newspaper" Metro. "
However, the Forensic Medicine Agency spoke in favor of the accuracy of the tests: « In general, it can be said that the risk of mistakenly taking a child for an adult is small.
With the greatest risk we face when the person will soon be 18, in which it is about 10 percent. "

The Peskov called these assumptions "based, hypothetical reasoning."
"There are no headquarters, until the establishment of the headquarters is far away, before the election campaign is far away," Peskov said.

Head of the Ukrainian delegation, Sergei Bazenko, is also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena reports, IAAF suspects sportswomen in the use of doping.

How the financial rules of football will affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not interfere with the world record of the transfer of Nemara from the Spanish Barcelona "to the French city of" Bet Saint Germain ".
Whatever the consequences may come further along the chain, for "Bet Saint Germain" by UEFA, the governing body controlling European football, in whose power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
From the rules of the financial regulations introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that the PSC will have to show that the transfer of Nemara was financed without major losses.
Thus Barcelona Majlis paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) just to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Near's move to France.
The PRJ can definitely split up to hire Near and add it to the galaxy of other stars, if one considers the financing of the team by the rich energy of Qatar's ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums to acquire players, but they have to balance them at the expense of legitimate sources of income to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
The FFA has introduced Michel Platini after being elected President of UEFA in 2007.
A former French football player believed that the clubs poured into huge debts in their quest for success, in effect, and risked ruin if banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on the debt of the clubs and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change the business model, which was originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with good potential, and then seriously spent, in order to improve the team and create a global brand of slander became a difficult plan.
During this three annual assessment period, which in 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.
And, despite the fact that Platini was disgraced from his presidency in 2015, his successor in UEFA, Alexander Ceferin, is still determined to curb excessive spending.
"Of course, the FFP is alive, and we are going to tighten the rules," said last week the Associated Press Spokesman Andrea Traverso, who controls the UEFA FFP.
"SSJ" and will pay a ransom to Neimar's contract lump sum, he can for this amount throughout the term of his contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer cost can be shown in annual reporting as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 to, as well as to the Abu Dhabi owned Manchester City « » hardest sanctions were applied.
"SSJ" was set a fine of 60 million euros (at that rate it is 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit the composition of his team in the Champions League during the 2014-season 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA tracks clubs that can try to resuscitate its financial inspections by inflating its income at the expense of companies associated with club owners.
Although the company could sponsor "SSJ", but if the amount of funding were considered higher than standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
That's what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of funding for the by the Qatar Tourism Authority was.
It was reported that part of the earnings of Neymar in the CEC could be in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But the "SSJ" and Qatari 2022 deny that Neymar will become the World Cup ambassador, and a similar maneuver could easily discover UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on the PSC mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday, the persons familiar with the situation, UEFA did not hold preliminary discussions with the CEC regarding the transfer of Neymar.
They communicated with the Associated Press Agency on condition of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the situation of the.
According to the latest published report, in the year 2015, the PSG received more than 10 million euros of profit at a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The for the last financial year has not yet been published.
It is expected that the arrival of Neymar will become a favorable ground for sponsorship deals, sales of attributes and T-shirts with the team logo.
The club expects turnover will grow at a minimum of 30 percent due to hiring a new player.
Undoubtedly angry with the fact that one of the best football players leaves, the Spanish league tried to prevent the transfer of Neymar, saying that the PSG would violate the financial arbitration.
This is an obvious case of dope » « financial, with the club and the state, "said the Spanish newspaper AS » « » La Liga Javier Tebas, bearing in mind that the ultimate owner « PSW » is Qatar.
The coach of Arsenal Arsenal Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La League's doubts about the financing of the club's by the state.
"These are all the consequences of shared participation, and this has completely changed the landscape of football over the past fifteen years," said on Thursday.
When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to observe a financial fantasy, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The and place of the oath will determine President
Where and how new Russian citizens will be sworn in on fidelity of the Russian Federation, will determine the president - such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law developed the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Building.
A week ago, deputies planned to directly determine the order of bringing the oath in law.
Children under 18 years will be exempt from bringing the solemn oath, as well as failing ones, from the text of amendments to the bill "On citizenship of the Russian Federation" (there is at the disposal of), which the committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on 11 July.
The idea of introducing the oath of citizenship of the Russian Federation instead of the formal signing of documents President Vladimir Putin supported on June 6 during a meeting with Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies issued this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill providing for the abolition of the decision on the issue of citizenship to those who were later convicted for a number of crimes of terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public calls to terrorism or his public justification in the media or on the Internet (Part 2 of Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code), as well as for hijacking of, trains or water transport, but - only if this act is related to terrorism (Part 4 of Article 211 of the Criminal Code).
According to the bill, the logic of it was this: formulating citizenship documents, a person subscribing under a promise to comply with Russian legislation - on the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
The bill in April submitted to the State Duma leaders of Duma factions Vladimir Vasilyev (United Russia), Gennady Zyuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov ("Fair Russia") and the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week the Committee on State Building and legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but now it has been reworked.
Now it says that the order of bringing the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, the parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On Citizenship of the Russian Federation," indicating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn atmosphere in front of the State Emblem and flag of Russia in the presence of the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, from the text of the bill it was not clear where such an event should take place - the list of places where the RF coat of arms could be placed is regulated by the corresponding federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of state authorities of subjects, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could have been zags.
To pronounce a solemn oath wishing to obtain citizenship of the Russian Federation will be after officials check their documents.
But the Russian passport person will receive only after the oath should be reworked from the text.
A week ago, the draft said that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn in from 18 years instead of 14.
A rule has been preserved, according to which incapacitated or incapacitated persons will be released from the oath, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or manually sign the text of the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to be exempt from this procedure and "other persons,"
Also in the updated bill prescribed a special procedure for admission to the Russian citizens of Ukraine, who are considered carriers of the Russian, has been.
They will have to officially renounce Ukrainian citizenship by an appropriate application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
The renunciation of "alien" citizenship, as of now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is impossible "for reasons beyond its control."
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the first vice-speaker of the State Duma Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrakhov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that it is impossible to get a certificate from Ukraine.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for the solution of their fate regarding the citizenship of the Russian Federation, "- explained the day before the head of the Duma Committee on State Building and Legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (EP).
In addition, the text appeared to clarify that restrictions on the occupation of certain posts for foreigners will not apply to those who in "other" citizenship and handed over the previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but "for reasons beyond its control" it has not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are forbidden to hold positions on municipal service, to be employed on objects and in organizations which activity is connected with security of Russia.
Also a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country cannot become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should come into force from September 1, 2017, the necessary legal acts should be prepared.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in the "hot American summer" and "Toaster detective"
The current iteration of history is nostalgic at the same time about the glory days of the characters in the 80 s; the era of in the 90s (around the time when the outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Showalter made the comedy sketches "State" for MTV); and about itself - that is about 2001, before its stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poler and Paul Rudd switched to more serious things.
As a of culture, it is simultaneously the elevation and embodiment of our epoch with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise it seems anachronism.
"The first day of the camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of the absurdist humor (including the original story about the talking bath of vegetables, which was voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually anxious children who only have reached adulthood; thanks to this inability to return to become part of the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults have already played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more unsystematic and includes riffs from stalker films of the, such as "Hands rocking the cradle."
In one episode, the character gets the Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many plot moves are the same.
Good-natured Cup (Shouolter), now a writer, still has not achieved reciprocity from Cathy (Marguerite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't parted with virginity.
And then there is still a and subjustful conspiracy in which Ronald Reagan is involved (also Showalker), whom George W. Bush is now running (experienced parody performed by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is a retreat from it.
It is especially funny to see the eternally young Radda singing a song by Matt Dillon from the "singles," whose character, the former big man Andy, now looks old.
To bring this franchise success could be casual madness in the spirit of the recursive series "Seven Up," until it comes to what I would be its logical conclusion: "the hot American summer: twenty years later," where in the last scene the whole company would go to the cinema for the premiere of the "Hot American Summer."
"Comrade detective" on Amazon turns to another type of nostalgia: memories of the Cold War from "Americans," "Explosion blonde" or even "Blesca" with its images of the struggle of the East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gates and Alessandro Tanaka with director Riza Thomas, portrays the film: the Romanian police drama of the 80 s about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The main roles - the life of Gregor and idealist Josef - are performed by Florin Piersik,., and Corneliu Ulich.
It's a brilliant idea.
But the idea.
There are several visual jokes (the police spend time watching chess, as Americans could watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the scenes - among them Jenny Slit, Nick Offerman, Maherral Ali and Chloe Sevinyi - allows you to play "guess the voice."
But "Comrade Detective" is so held up for the plausibility of a clumsy propaganda drama - there is even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask - which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are, and funny happens not very and not often.
For example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American embassy, there are two thick people sitting in the lobby, absorbing a bunch of of hamburgers.
An imaginary Communist spectator of this image says that Western culture is capable of making a.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with them too.

This statement was made by the official representative of the State Department Heather Nauert in response to the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on the relations between the two states.

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation forced speculation about a possible increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain unhurried, and has left interest rates unchanged amid rising pressure on family incomes.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with a score of 6 against 2 for keeping rates at 0.25%, while fewer members of the committee argued for a rate increase because weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts for an increase of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family incomes will continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to about 3% in the autumn.
However, the bank warned that a rate hike in the next few years will be necessary to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said that borrowing costs would probably will have to rise stronger than expected in financial markets.
Also members of the committee voted to abandon part of a huge complex of measures to develop the economy, launched a year ago due to.
Starting next February, the bank will close the bailout plan, which it provides to banks with cheap loans, although it said it now has to provide another 15 billion pounds to 115 billion pounds.
In the protocol on the decision on rates, the bank said: "According to the MPC's main forecasts, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in the near term remains slow, while pressure on real incomes of families continues to affect consumption."
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that in order to suspend inflation, it would require some tightening of fiscal policy ", a somewhat larger amount than markets expect.
At the moment, the markets are predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all the increases will be gradual gradual and limited.
The bank's forecasts for the increase in this and the next year are lower than forecasts made in May, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank left its forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
After these news sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was taken after recent disappointing growth figures weakened the increased expectation of increase; GDP then rose by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the bank's representative, the growth appears to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little cause for joy to households, which hit high inflation and very minor wage increase: according to the bank, the pressure will intensify before declining.
The bank added that fiscal policy could not prevent a long-term recovery in earnings in the next few years, but expects that the of CARICOM will recover significantly by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of the growing demand for British goods, owing to the low pound exchange rate, which compensates for some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision came a year after last August rates were reduced to 0.25% after the shocking results of a referendum on withdrawal from the European Union, which caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its final decision on rates, there was a buzz around the alleged rate hike, as inflation was increasingly pressing on and so heavily pressured households: three members of the committee asked to raise rates to 0.5% in July.
Last month inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although, according to the bank, this fall was expected and in the coming months again compensated.
According to the bank, the higher rate compared with the planned 2% is entirely due to the low exchange rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of the Mortgage Brokerage Company,, said: "we take into account the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market appears to be even more competitive, as lenders require business opportunities and expect a good end to the year.
The market looks particularly favorable for those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing of loans, often with the possibility of a lack of commission, as well as a low rate, is becoming popular as never ».

The program will cost 10 million pounds, and the National Health Service of England this week, after an international tender for procurement signed an agreement on the provision of drugs.
The study is in such a way to assess all the possibilities of by collecting clinical data about who is the target audience of the drug, about its assimilation and application on a large scale.
This is the most important innovation should complement and strengthen the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the biggest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National Directorate for the spread of AIDS), said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.

We warmly welcome this news.
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "Now first of it is necessary to ensure that the test is quickly deployed across the country, and that none of the HIV risk group is forgotten.
Now that we are provided with an experimental PEP drug we are going to protect more than 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone.
Shadow Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: "we very much welcome the start of the test, it has been very late for months of delays and delays from the government."
The data demonstrate how revolutionary this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the of transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us closer to a full understanding of the benefits of.
It is now important that the test be deployed as soon as possible across the country to protect people at risk of HIV and to move us one step further towards ending the spread of HIV in society.

The traffic police unit are experiencing a shortage of international driver's licenses (IDL).
To get such rights, it is necessary to wait for several weeks, which has become a real problem for holidaymakers wishing to go abroad on their own car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driver's licenses remains controversial.
The ICC was introduced to make it easier for foreign police to understand what is written in the national identity, since the information in it is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized and.
In fact, however, everything depends on specific police or rolling offices: some require IDs, and there are enough national rights.
In order to be insured, the drivers of international law, but it is worth considering that in the countries that have not ratified the convention (for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia), the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or IDPs.
Now there is a problem with blanks in almost all traffic police divisions, "Kommersant," having carried out a in some regions.
So, in Moscow, there are no more than four months in the units of the Russian Railways, which are simply not issued.
It is possible to make an appointment on the site of public services, but there the queue already stretched till the middle of August.
In Krasnoyarsk it is impossible to get MBA "for technical reasons," without going into details, in the Samara region honestly say that there are no forms, the similar situation develops in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem.
Irina Burmistrova: "guess why in Moscow it is impossible to obtain international rights?"
It's, because in all branches of the Ministry of Internal Affairs the forms ended.
Elena Podkolzina: "the question to the knowledgeable people!"
It is necessary to obtain international rights very urgently.
In Moscow all the time scored far ahead, on a place of coupons at all don't give out (the button is, but the coupon can't give).
It seems that the portal of public services shows that in Spb time free to fig.

He added that he considers Russia unable to implement a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build less large-scale objects.
I know that after the Olympic Games in Sochi whole stadiums already began to.

The permanent walk stretched for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Remio was still fired.
But not his immediate boss.

Judges propose to protect from the chairmen
The Presidential Council on Human Rights (HRC) on behalf of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The ECHR proposes to limit the powers of court chairmen and to introduce their electability.
For the courts of appeal and cassation instances, the ECHR wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to administrative-territorial division of the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential order.
The HRC has finalized proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out on behalf of Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, which the President gave after meeting with members of the Council.
At a meeting with members of the Council of 8 December 2016 was discussed including individual cases judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see "Kommersant" 9 December).
The results of the work of the HRC were 25 proposals, which concern both the issues of ensuring the independence of judges and the detection of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of court chairmen to increase the independence of the rest of the judges.
If the candidate for the position of judge has successfully passed the contest and received the support of the judicial community, the chairman of the court, in the opinion of the ECHR, should submit it to the appointment, not having the right to refuse, as the law allows now.
It is also proposed to deprive the chairman of the right to distribute cases to the judges.
To do this, allow experts, can specially written computer program.
Also, the ECHR considers that the chairman does not have the right to "prejudge the results of the qualification certification of the judge, initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, make decisions on establishing additional material payments."
At the same time, the presidential council considers it necessary to proceed to "of the judges of the court chairmen by the judges themselves" and "to give their powers for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation."
Now all chairmen of courts (from republican to district) are appointed for six years by the president upon proposal of the chairman of the Supreme Court of of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect the judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HRC proposes to organize an appeal and cassation in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative no-territorial division of the Russian Federation.
The ECHR says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts."
Experts take as a basis for the practice of arbitration courts.
There are "judicial districts" that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but they guarantee greater independence from regional officials, who are hampered by the use of "telephone law."
The HRC proposes to strengthen the judges of the world in order to consider some "categories of civil and administrative cases."
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, restoration at work, the protection of honor and dignity, the removal of driver's licenses, etc.
"These are just our proposals," - explained "Kommersant" the member of the ECHR, the judge of the Constitutional Court retired Tamara Morshchakova.
She also recalled that the President's instructions related not only to the, but also to the Supreme Court (SC), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
The time for the of orders from the Armed Forces (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation) still exists.
To report to Vladimir Putin about how effectively in ensuring the independence of justice is, the chairman of the Russian Federation Armed Forces Vyacheslav Lebedev must until September 1.
Living a high life: half-floor and cunning design receptions have turned this small apartment in Earls Court into spacious dwellings
Joan Lee, a former real estate banker, in 2014, moved from a spacious home in to an apartment in Lis Court.
The apartment is located on the ground floor of a nice typical house in the style of Queen Anne, and in favour of the new design says that Joan did not gather their belongings and did not moved again.
"I was living with my former in," says Joan.
"I was looking for something comparable to my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered a price on the same day. "
From the of the first viewing the apartment of 1000 square feet has undergone full reconstruction.
Initially it was an apartment with one bedroom complex planning to get into the bedroom, it was necessary to go through the kitchen, and Joanna wanted to add space to store things and a half-floor to squeeze the maximum benefit from the generous height of the ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
These were my requirements, "she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting-Hille architectural design studio, Duck & Shed, to use ceilings 12.5 feet tall and set up a dwelling that would not only be a successful project, but would have been with Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to arrange two rooms one above the other, so the architectural task was to create a half-floor where one could stand in full growth.
Erfan had to think creatively to cope with the.
"Work with steel constructions is very complicated," he explains.
"We need to the rooms so that they were one over the other, and we didn't have to bend.
It was necessary not only to build a simple platform, but to bend the constructions so that they were at the right height and allowed to use the premises from above and from below.
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms one above the other in the space of the city and a lot more interesting.
From the half-floor through the vintage copper light window from the Basilica Retrouvius, there is a view of the chic living room below.
Mirror furniture with gold finishes, silver accents and vintage lighting from Serra MusI ask style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding staginess, space and light.
The short corridor is framed by mirrors so that it looks longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror shield appears to be a window into another room.
At the entrance mirror cabinets are used to store all Joan's tableware.
To create a sense of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can occupy the kitchen when it does not use it.
There is nothing new in the folding kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a sliding door, like a garage.
"The engineering art was involved here," said about the reinforced steel door door.
"It is equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it is very easy to.
Thanks to the intelligent use of space and storage areas, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and improved layout.
At the end of the, the floor area is exactly what you will sell, that is, what your property is valued for, "he says.
In other words, the real estate agent will enter and make settlements on the basis of the floor area.
Here they were able to increase the floor area using quality materials that give the space to a shade of luxury.
"The Materials are something that we touch, so they help create an emotional connection to the home," says Erfan.
Thus no one falls in love with the electrical wiring in the walls.
It is important, but not hurt our hearts » strings.
This is a testament to the fact that due to the good design and the larger size, the apartment can be turned into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.

MFA outraged blocking statements of the UN Security Council on attacks on the Russian Federation Embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of individual Western diplomatic representatives who block statements by the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
It is reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Ministry recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2, for the third time in a month, was subjected to mortar shell fire by the terrorist groups "Hayat Tahrir Ash- Sham" (former "Jabhat an Dzhabhat ant-Nusra," banned in the Russian Federation) and "Filak Ar-Rahman."
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in the qualification of "Nusra" as a terrorist organisation, and the UN Security Council resolutions urge to counteract this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem, of course, that the Nusra attacks should meet universal unconditional and decisive condemnation, and there should be no ambiguity in the assessments against diplomatic missions."
However, as in the diplomatic department, "for the third time in a month the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately, varying the tone of objections, covered with arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard brief draft statement of the Security Council to press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital."
The unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us may remain on the conscience of these delegations.
"The most outrageous thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and attacks, gives them a sense of impunity," the Foreign Ministry said and added that "it would not be desirable for these barbarians to create a belief that they are at the same time in the Security Council."
Vladimir Putin spoke for to the number of unscheduled inspections of business
Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East said that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the number of planned, and also said about the need to limit the duration of the inspections by ten days.
"Extraordinary checks are carried out, as a rule, without corresponding coordination with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% is agreed with the prosecutor's office, everything else goes on its own," the TASS president quoted as saying.
Vladimir Putin also said that it is necessary to prohibit investigators to withdraw servers and hard drives at enterprises.
In addition, according to the president, business associations should be entitled to protect the interests of their members in court.
"This is, I hope, will make a certain positive in the consideration of cases related to business activities or related to the violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
According to "Kommersant," the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs grows because of the moratorium on carrying out scheduled inspections.
In May, according to the order of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, a survey was conducted, as a result of which it was found out that in fact there was a substitution of planned inspections unplanned (the share of those facing them rose from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), the prosecutor's office (from 16.9% to 21.8%), Rangers (from 16.9% to 21.8%), as well as checks on citizens "(growth from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative investigations (10.8% to 15.5%).

Brothers fight for real estate empire worth more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's largest empires in real estate trading worth more than $500 million - forty years after their Italian ancestors founded a dynasty.
Former director of the football club Karlton and developer Colin de Lutis lives in Palace Turak three doors from his younger brother Paul, who has filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court about possessions and assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court until stretches fierce dispute about the terms of divorce.
Together with his mother Anna, the brothers own 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars bought since their family bought a shop at Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded the "Westco Jeans, which has grown into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money has been invested in real estate, and the list of the family De Lutis today includes office buildings, for construction in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold coast and in Mount Buller and shopping centres in the suburbs.
By agreement with the late father Colin - whom Paul describes as "the main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family - owns roughly two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul is roughly one third.
According to the court, this means that the property of Colin is 316 million, and Paul - 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful reconciliation attempts, the first hearings were held in the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now argue about who will control the existing business - from which, according to Paul, Colin excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some objects.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider the family a top priority," he wrote.
Court costs are rising as a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer have been brought to the cause; both parties have attracted the most prominent lawyers, including royal lawyer Allan Myers, and the best strikers.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s they managed milk bars and,, and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees they bought a shop in Collingwood, in which Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he launched Westco when he was "in the last classes of the school, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years)."
Anna De Lutis says that they with Luigi, who died in 2012, had hoped to hand over their possession to sons without conflicts.
"Luigi often told me that he did not want the brothers to in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, no longer part of the De Lucia group; Colin says that Mark got 10 million when he went out of business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "unhappy with the financial terms of their secession."
Colin was not a public figure, though he was a former member of the board of directors of the club AFL and according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media on Friday contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered with a text message saying that the case had not yet been considered in court, "I have nothing to say."
"I am very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and to crack in court the name of our family," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in his testimony that he tried to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our father would not like to see how we with Paul arguing in court," he said, adding that "still hopes for resolution of the conflict."
On Friday, this hope apparently dissipated.
"The decision on our case will soon be made by the court," wrote Colin.
The new head of the apparatus Trump's plans to limit the flow of information to the president.
Others tried to do this and.
Maybe John F. Kelly will be able to do this.
In such a case, he will be the first.
"Politico" reports that the new head of the White House apparatus plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media, - hoping to keep the boss in a quieter state.
This is what reporter Josh Dozi reports.
"At a meeting held by the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly with the leadership of the apparatus on his first working day, he outlined a major problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: bad channels of information coming to the president."
Kelly told the staff that the information should go through it - in paper form or through briefings - because the president will be better decisions if he would get the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is perfectly true, but others have already failed, trying to pacify Trump by tracing information.
President Trump's relationship with television emerged decades ago - and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to demonstrate to him that he had received fair coverage in publications that could be," said in February, "Politico" by Sam Nanberg, a former adviser to the electoral headquarters.
Tara Palmeri then wrote in "Politico," that "according to six former members of the electoral headquarters, to keep Trump's habit of writing to Twitter, it was necessary to watch that the information coming personally was a steady stream of praise."
Well.
But the idea that Trump's habit of writing to Twitter was "under control" is simply ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the electoral staff know something we don't know - for example, that if they weren't, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump has not published.
If his staff had saved him from trouble at least several times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one ever managed to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda, giving Trump material - whether reliable or not - that confirms their views.
"Political" - just in this story - wrote in May about the inclination advisers constantly to the president dubious information.
Here is one example, described by the reporter Shein Goldman:
"Trump's current and former employees say that Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially containing dangerous information leaks, and will not calm down until he finds who stood behind them.
This was the case at the end of February, when the president a of an article with GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, in which the deputy head of the apparatus Cathy Welsh was accused of "behind a series of leak" in the White House.
It is no matter that Johnson is forever banned Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he did not present specific facts or that in the past he has launched false accusations and then refused them.
Trump read the article and began asking employees about Welsch. "
Goldschumacher adds that the then chief of staff Raymond Pribus, and the of the apparatus Rob Porter "tried to build a system to manage the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly is trying to do the same.
Maybe he will be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump is still impulsive, and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These persistent factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen prosecutor's office is fighting with the HIV-dissident
The prosecutor's office challenged the decision of the Kaliningrad District Court of Tyumen, which stopped the criminal case against a local resident, who died from HIV a young daughter.

The prosecutor's office with the decision of the court did not agree and filed an appeal, demanding to cancel the decision on termination of the case and send it to new consideration.
The girl died, and the harm caused by the crime is impossible.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of the doctors refused to examine the baby and treat her from a dangerous infection, "- reported in the press service of the prosecutor's office.

As told in the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children, HIV patients, do not receive medical care because of parents' refusal.
"And this situation has already improved - in the year of the work of the special group, half of parents who categorically refused to treat children from HIV, changed their opinion - allowed the diagnosis, began to take drugs," said a spokeswoman for the AIDS Centre, Elena Loseev.
According to her, the legislative way to act on parents is impossible, and as a result not all HIV-infected children are able to detect - mothers do not give them to, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV dissidents?
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study of the so-called movement of HIV dissidents in Russia.

The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act because they are completely unable to solve the problem.
Roma were here in May, they were driven out, and here they returned again.
Last night even more Roma arrived, and today, perhaps even more.
The Municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court rulings to protect their parks, "she added.
I live on Stritsbrook Road, and I don't like that I continue to pay the municipal tax, and the municipality can't even put an end to it. "
One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "this is, we have just seen these Roma leave the previous time, and here, please, this attack continues.
This time, there were more of them, and we even saw a horse riding on the meadow. "
The representative of the municipality of Solichala stated: "We are aware of the illegal camp on the ground near Strutsbrook Road and cooperate with Solicullah police; we are taking the necessary legal action to ensure that they can be forgiven as soon as possible."
To assist us in collecting evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by phone 101.
This makes it possible to get an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.

The Ministry of Agriculture of the Crimea stated that if over the next three years there are no funds for the modernization of the enterprise, there will be a threat of the plant shutdown.
Depreciation of fixed assets at the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion rubles.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"To get money from the owner is problematic, to talk about attracting borrowed funds of large credit institutions is difficult," - said the deputy head of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Crimea Sergey Petelin in April this year.
The Crimean parliament included the enterprise in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to carry out its corporatization and to put up.
The source of "Interfax" in the authorities of the Crimea estimated the possible cost of selling the enterprise at $40 million, investment of the investor in the modernization - another $30 million.
"New Light" in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 - up to 1.52 million bottles.

The Nizhny Novgorod third graders defeated more than 40 tombstones
Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Nizhny Novgorod region established the identity of citizens who destroyed 46 gravestones in the cemetery of the city of.
The attackers were third-class students.
The first claim that the grave plates were damaged by the unknown, came to the OMVD of Russia on Lyskovsky district on June 27.
In total, 24 people to the police.
As a result, a criminal case was opened under Article 244 of the Criminal Code "Destruction, damage or desecration of burial places."

Preventive measures were carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening the tone against the ships of NGOs rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned the, which are owned by rescue vessels in the Mediterranean, that they will not be able to continue to work unless subject to the new rules governing their activities.
"If the NGO does not comply with the new code of conduct, it is hard to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," - said the Minister of Internal Affairs Mario Minnitskaya in an interview with the tourist daily newspaper La Stampa. "
The Ministry's warning came the day after Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, on suspicion that its crew actually cooperating with human traffickers and facilitates illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has worked only a year, declined to comment on the merits of the detailed charges brought against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Kartosio.
"For us, the of human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we very much regret that we cannot now continue activities in the search and rescue zone," - says the statement of the organization in social networks.
"We will be able to assess all the charges now only after we gather all the information and will will be able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring Juventa, which is owned by Jugend Rettet, since October.
His crew is suspected of took on board migrants who were sent directly to them by human traffickers, and allowing smugglers to leave with boats they could use anew.
At least one such meeting is supposed to have taken place just 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the, the contents of which were published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities, which control the rescue operations in this zone, rather from humanitarian zeal than on any other motive.
The code of conduct suggests, mainly, that Juventa vessels will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to submit to the code: "save the Children," Maltese moas and "Pro-Activa open arms" from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considers the new rules unnecessary but acceptable provided that they do not entail any "significant changes or interference" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is also the Nobel Prize organization Médecins sans frontières (MSF).
Meanwhile, the Ministry said that the sharp decline in recent weeks of the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we don't want to be associated with any side of the conflict"
The authorities of the Russian Federation have lately noticeably stepped up their policy on the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow, delegations of opposing Libyan parties have.
The head of the Russian contact group on intra-Libyan settlement under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, the assistant to the head of the Chechen republic Lev Dengov told Kommersant, what goals are being pursued Moscow in the region and who makes a bet.
The contact group on Libya you lead, almost nothing is known.
Here, say, a contact group on Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here is the veil of mystery.
What exactly are you doing, what goals are being pursued?
The Contact Group was created on the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Its activity is supervised by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (deputy of the Duma from Chechnya. - "Kommersant,").
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The for the creation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanic Chebobáv" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board). - "Kommersant.
We thought about how to help the crew.
Then the contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, was created, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.
And it turned out, what exactly do you lead it?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group's work.
Our activity was not limited to the release of seafarers from the "Chebotarev Mechanics."
We managed to establish contacts with representatives of all the main factions opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and on the part of Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government, led by Fazom Sarajem, is based), and with Tobruk (the of parliament, which opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern parts of Libya).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (Deputy Prime Minister of Libya - Kommersant), we managed to quickly negotiate the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Its task is analysis of the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I want to emphasize that in Libya we don't want to be associated with any side of the conflict, we are in dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
Now the contact group includes five people.
Among them there are people with experience in the law enforcement agencies, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to introduce a group of specialists in the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
No one is permanently in Libya.
There are now in Libya Russian military advisers, instructors.
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about it are not true.
But in your contact group, the former military enters...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or closed up to a certain point for us cities like Misuata (where the played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and in the. - Kommersant)).
We arrived in Misurata in January of this year.
We were frightened, they said that all of them are Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are such rumors, what the role of Islamists is in reality.
In Misrata, we met with all the representatives of the detachments who were engaged in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was cut off from the militants banned in Russia "Islamic State" - "Kommersant").
We wanted to see them, get acquainted with these people, check the information that they played a decisive role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, and not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed to himself these merits.
And to what conclusion did you come?
"Islamic State" in Libya won not Haftar?
It wasn't him.
Haftar conducted operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And with ISIS in Sirte the structures subordinated to the government in Tripoli were fought.
And, by the way, we invited people who carried out this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, the Libyan delegation accepted in the Federation Council, in the Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Rosguard.
You, as we have understood, are in all Libyan regions and probably imagine the mood of local elites and field commanders.
How do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, and the elections reached at the end of July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faziz Saraj?
Or again, as has happened repeatedly in the past, the agreements will be sorted, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to sole seize power alone?
For us, the fact that Saraj and Haftar had agreed to another meeting, it was a good signal.
In the recent past, both leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
As for Russia's position...
Often write and say that Moscow actively supporting Haftar, many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in, and Haftar was on the board of the Russian carrier "Admiral Kuznetsov" on this day.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurat did not believe in the coincidence.
We were told: "you are probably very courageous people that came to us today."
But our task is just to show: we do not support only Haftar, we are in dialogue with all the key participants in the conflict in Libya.
You with Haftar communicated.
The understanding with Russian partners on a human, emotional level, the fact that he twice studied in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know the Russian language?
The Russian, if he knows, it is very relative.
But what he has learned, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And by the way not only with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet the generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And that's how they speak fluent Russian.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent feel nostalgic on it.
Do you consider the imminent cancellation of the arms embargo imposed on Libya?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in supplying Russian weapons?
We are interested, of course, but, as I have already said, we do not engage in this conflict and would not want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be roughly equal.
As for the weapons embargo, there are frequent calls from Libyans to ensure that Russia has somehow contributed to its removal.
The process of drafting a constitution is now being actively pursued in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions, and achieve internal consensus.
Then the elections are to be held, as well as discussed at the meeting between Saraj and Haftar.
If the elections are held and the legitimate government is finally elected (and now none of the parties have such a status), it is possible to put in the UN Security Council the issue of lifting the weapons embargo.
Raising this issue is now meaningless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees from Libya, feels abandoned by the EU allies.
Can Moscow in this situation help Italian partners using their ties with Libyans?
How, for example, is it realistic that the Haftara brigades will establish control over the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers transferring immigrants to Europe?
Very timely question.
We are actively working on it.
The Italians need the support of Russia, because Moscow dialogue simultaneously with Haftar, and with Sarajevo, and with and the south of the country.
And in this issue the tribes in the south of Libya play a big role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
It is a of the people of the to ensure that the flows of migrants on distant approaches?
That is, conditionally speaking, the buses in which Nigerian migrants go back?
We achieve it.
But it is not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in ensuring that these flows continue.
We hope to help unite the southerners in the negotiation process between Sarajevo, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But to begin with, we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and.
The head of government in Tripoli Fiz Saraj is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of Sharia norms in the country.
How radical does he holds?
Will this be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I will give my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But the Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he holds the position that Libya must be an absolutely normal country - a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where does he have such a reputation?
It is created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, there is legislative, executive and judicial power.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank, and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not staying there.
And we have all the cards laughed and began to actively communicate with Tripoli, and with Tobruk.
And already reap the fruits of this work: Rosneft has signed a cooperation agreement with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
The director of NOC, Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin concluded the deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago there was the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft.
What will Russia do with it?
I believe that resell.
And what of Russia's economic interests in Libya?
It is planned to resign contracts concluded with Muammar Gaddafi.
It is, in particular, about previous agreements in the transport sphere (construction of railways), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
And Libyans have something to pay?
Well, they have oil.
That is, as in the case of Iran, is the "oil in exchange for services" scheme?
I don't know what the scheme will be, I don't do it directly.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya and not the main thing.
We are, in fact, engaged in peacekeeping work.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help Libyans to agree among themselves, so that they could establish order and Libya ceased to be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task is to help the Libyan people and squeeze from terrorists.
Do you have information about the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to this.
I met with the representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to date, not a single person from Russia and other countries of the former USSR is not there.
He said that he has about 50 thousand records of telephone conversations of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - "Kommersant"), and Russian speech does not sound there.
And from what states then these militants?
I wouldn't want to go into these details.
Then formulate the question differently.
How many of the Islamists in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are almost no Libyans among them, they are no more than 5%.
The rest are.
Can Moscow conduct intra-Libyan negotiations following the example of Paris?
Such plans are.
We have active negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have declared their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
And when can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
Several visits have to take place, and then hopefully there will be clarity about the time and place of the negotiations.

Michelle Carter's verdict for reports that prompted by the suicide of Conrad Roy
A resident of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for what it via text messages and phone calls has encouraged suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will have to be 15 months of his term behind bars and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the involuntary manslaughter by Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Father Roy said at the hearing on Thursday: "my family is killed by grief.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain at liberty prior to the appeal.
She had a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said she and Roy suffered mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red pants and cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, squeezing his hands and lowering his eyes.
"By her actions she killed Konrad Roy," - said the prosecutor.
"She interrupted his life to improve his own.
She did not recognize responsibility, "she said.
"She did not show remorse."
But lawyer Carter stated that it was "a tragic case, which she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his opinion, her "age, maturity level or even mental illness did not affect her actions."
The Prosecutor read out the statements of the mother Roy Lynn Roy, which says: "day has passed when I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I cope - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will stay with us forever, "he says.
Roy Camdin Roy's sister said she was unfailed by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunt.
"A person who has been with me always since my birth is a pain that will stay with me until the end of life," she said.
This case appears to be a legal precedent, because Massachusetts does not have a law that would mandate a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy found himself dead with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case attracted the attention of the entire country when it became known that he had been pushed to suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang up, jump from the roof, kill yourself with a knife I don't know there are many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before the suicide she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You only have to the ignition, and you will become free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to get attention with the death of Roy, and forbade her to communicate with the media, not to give it to the desired.
The lawyers' opinions were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for the murder in Italy of his British neighbor's apartment and acquitted two years later.
The 30-year old Nox published in the "Los-Angeles Times special opinion, in which it was claimed:" Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and assistance, not prison. "

Containers Audi will have to modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the announcement by on the part of the Chairman of the Government of the Republic of, BMW has announced that it will offer to update more than 350,000 vehicles.
Chairman of the BMW Group said that the company believes that there are more intelligent ways than the restrictions on driving the, bearing in mind the European cities of Petrograd including Munich, where there is a BMW subsidiary - which considered the possibility of banning or restricting the use of diesel vehicles.
Kuwaiti Daimler said Thursday that it would modify the three million Mercedes Benz vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies called their move to the.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with carbon emissions regulations.
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automakers to install equipment that neutralizes diesel exhaust gases is also increasing, and it is difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German automakers are under close scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of indulging influential automakers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying not to repeat the mistakes of the Volkswagen Volkswagen, which concealed the use of the so-called fissile devices, which during testing could adjust the amount of harmful gases to comply with the rules, and in the conditions of normal driving were disabled.
In the United States, a conviction has been filed against several Volkswagen executives, the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany arrested the former head of the department of thermodynamics as a part of the engine development group "Audi Audi."
Former manager, Zakkeo Giovanni Pasio, Italian, and therefore not protected from extradition and can be in the United States.
Earlier this year, Mr. Audi Hussein was subjected to a German criminal investigation involving Mr. Folkswagen, after the authorities accused him of setting up a system to circumvent European emission rules and expanded the investigation that had previously been focused on the United States.
The inclusion of the Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for the Volkswagen Group: the luxury car manufacturer is the source of a disproportionately large share of the income of the Volkswagen Group.

Astronomers have found a "hellish" planet, on which even iron can melt
For the first time, having studied the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were much surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Specialists noticed that the water molecules are so heated by the light of the star that emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope has captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the planet's atmosphere to glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot humidifiers" - gas giants in size and mass comparable to the largest planet of the solar system, but located dozens of times closer to the parent star.
This year, there are only 1.3 "earthly" days on the exoplanet, "and its gas shell is nearly 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens Lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and Southern France, but there are now fears that it is being threatened by climate change.
Lavender has grown worse due to dry weather and insect-borne diseases; this has a constant headache for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from Provence agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, says: "Lavender in Provence really is under threat, because in recent years this plant feels the effects of climate change: in the spring and especially in the autumn rains have become much less.
This affects the life of the lavender.
And still there are small cycades, jump on leaves insects carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather they become very much. "
There is a lot at stake.
Lavender not only attracts holidaymakers; lavender oil is very popular in and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says: "instead of very long ears with a large number of large flowers we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or generally absent.
So we have fewer parts containing essential oil. "
The decisions now being considered include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with protective mixture of clay and water and producing varieties more resistant to drought.

At the same time, he refused to comment on Medvedev's assertion of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia, it certainly has the right to speak, but more on this subject, I can't say anything," said the representative of the State Department.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said that Washington declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, ending the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that the sanctions will take effect for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister believes, the American establishment "outright beat" Trump.
The in the Moscow bodybuilder found on someone else's dacha who lost memory
The bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov went missing on the road to Noginsk on July 25.
Seven days, he was unsuccessfully searched for the by familiar and local residents.
And Shamil was found on an alien dacha in Ramenskoye.
He was completely naked in his toilet.
The Dagestan athlete couldn't explain how appeared here and what happened to him.
He could not even remember how his name, and the passport was missing.
To establish the identity helped the announcement of his missing.
The doctors, who arrived by the call, recorded a partial loss of memory and cranial trauma, reported Mash.
Probably, the athlete also waits for other surprises.
The intruders who kidnapped Shamil probably already visited his apartment, the keys of which he also stole.
Oil and gas revenues July exceeded the forecast of 7.4 billion rubles
Actually received oil and gas revenues in July 2017 exceeded the estimate of 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, according to the agency, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the U. S. dollar to the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June used for evaluation, as well as by virtue of exceeding the actual volume of gas production and the volume of export of oil products projected levels.
"The rejection of the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate corresponding to the Federal Law on the federal budget for 2017-2019, in August 2017, is to be in the amount of + 40.2 billion rubles," the Ministry of Finance said in a statement.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic currency market during the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017, is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of foreign currency purchases will be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be making purchases of foreign currency purchases by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Each working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude deals on foreign currency purchase at the organized trades of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The purchased foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The a journalist stresses that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Employees of the weekly newspaper "Riodos" usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in the state of, related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, with their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told that they need to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seems safer: to take children with them in the office, which in 2009 threw a grenade, or leave them at home.
Security experts wrote on the board hanging in the room, three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - proof no need, suspicion and internal sensations will be enough.
It is drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected of being held by the government or the cartels, a whole list of, for which the work to cover the chaos in Mexico becomes dangerous.
Violence does not give respite, and there are more and more journalists among the corpses that multiply in the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, no less than 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter - their publisher and inspirer, co-founder of "Riodos" Javier Valdes Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdes in one of his many books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence is felt very acutely, although his presence everywhere - a big photo of Valdez showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the facade of the building "Riodos"; two reporters for 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramírez, wear t-shirts on which his smile, face in glasses or his signature panama.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their overall trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although in 2010 the office of a special federal prosecutor was organized to investigate journalistic cases, while, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases were investigated.
As in the case of most of the thousands of murders committed each year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists are rarely prosecuted.
Riodis journalists insist that they will write about the violence in, even though they are killed by grief, though around now much more dangerous.
Without information about the, without justice from talking about security at meetings little good, "says Ibarra.
"It's very foolish to spend time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we don't know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the office of "Riodos" in the capital of the state of.
He managed to drive only a couple of quarters before his red Toyota Coral stopped two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name - which means "Twelfth River."
The gunman left for his car and crashed her nearby.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He is a with his wife and two adult children.
Rumours tend to diverge quickly across the region.
But about Valdes practically everything is silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions struggle to fill the established vacuum.
Let us not say that every day one or more people are killed in the streets of, or that the cemetery is filled with two-storeyed mausoleums, which is more than the houses of many living people.
Let's forget for a moment that the state of "calm" is simply when one of the cartels takes control of the seaside state with important ports and ways of drug trafficking leading in the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdes knew very well about the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, 60-year-old co-founder and director of "Riodos," is riddled with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He thinks that the murder helped two mistakes.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival cartel factions Cartwright, who is at war with Guzmán's sons.
The publication could have angered the sons; people who were supposedly members of the gang bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not didn't force Waldez for his own security to leave the country after another newspaper was captured that wrote about the same story.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste and in 2003, together with five colleagues, founded "," selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without affecting the subject of drugs," Bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation for bold and honest publication, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reportages without fear of censorship, and readers attracted that in this edition they could read about what no one else dared to write.
Eight years after its founding, "Riodos" received the prestigious Maria Murs Cabo for his work in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdes won the International Freedom Prize for daring to investigate Mexico's drug cartels wherever it is.
He frankly confessed that he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ award.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is "a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Romsinger TV.
"You have to take the tasks that lie on you as a journalist - either so you're just stealing a fool."
I don't want me to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around, why didn't you say what was going on?"
The employees of "Riodos" bored by, a joke that was a loader at the port, a friend, a generous on his embrace and advice, a teacher who knew how to hide alive.
They relied on their order.
He had to always wear his hat.
He had to walk to "El Guayabo," a bar in front of the office, and always sit there behind the same table.
Now they ask: it has destroyed love once established order?
His death led them to doubt their calculations of how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like when you're dealing with their wives, children, their legal business, and the clandestine airfields.
"These things were behind the line," said Bohorkes.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and the pursuit of self-preservation.
It is necessary to believe your instincts.
Keep away from what smells bad.
The problem, says the editor of "Riodos" Andres Villarreal, is that "smelling can be fooled by and then what happened to Javier."
The old rules, he says, and others, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - as in,, Guerrero, and other states, where there is a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling paths, weak state institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In a room where riot police gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to make cell phones: a few days before it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments, is being used in Mexico to monitor journalists and public activists.
Outside, two police officers are in the shade of a tree from 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were given the task of the state government to the office of "Riodos," which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois quarter of.
Some journalists jokingly asked whether these police were not included in the 50 percent of the order of the order about whom the governor himself said that they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to the mountainous area, which is de facto controlled by gangs of drug traffickers.
In the nearest room, "Riodos" counted on three main topics.
This is the murder in of the brother of former boxing champion Julio Sezar Chavez.
They to expose government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants of the, a from the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant at the same time drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of government over the past century.
Recently against several governors from the PRI have been put forward loud accusations of corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of "El Chapo" Guzman slipped away from the military cloud.
A few months ago, readers would look for a column Valdes with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
"We would already know what happened," - says the 46-year-old Villareal, for his thin physique nicknamed "El Flanco."
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdes' cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers with protests against the killing of journalists, because employees have become what they never thought to become: activists acting on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office dedicated to another journalist.
El Salvador Adam disappeared in the state of Michoacan in the west of the country three days after Valdes was killed.
They found a burnt body, and the authorities said it was on the basis of DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On this day, the director of Bohorkes was in Washington, trying to gain international support in demanding justice in the case.
At a meeting with the governor of the day after the murder of, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their for telling the truth.
After that, she asked not to give her more jobs to cover the government activities, fearing that anger would hurt her objectivity.
Valdes said many times that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, its accomplices in government and indifferent society.
In his latest book Narco-journalism, Narcotics Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not just killed by drug gangs; they do so on the orders of politicians and security services in collusion with organized crime.
The Committee for the Protection of Press "Artikulo 19" believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out on the orders of the police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to," says.
Of course, murders eliminate people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body found a note allegedly written on behalf from the of the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her cut head.
Some publications chose to close down as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the killing of her correspondent Miroslav Brich in March.
Others continue to hold on as "El Manana" from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels via an editorial on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or the country in general.
This is a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they continue to see danger in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as it obviously happened with photographer Rubben Espinoza, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracross.
Those who remain and continue to work daily balance between risky decisions.
Ibarra - who ever dreamed of being a poet - admits that he was scared to write about the drug trade.
"Mexico is rolled into hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was already ready for printing, the publishers of "Riodos" sat on the pavement next to the office and drank beer when their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between the opposing gangs and security forces near the resort town of Mazatlan left, according to confirmed data, 19 corpses.
The war continued to unravel, as promised in a series of ambassadors from the cartels discovered in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted news via mobile phone on the website of "Riodos."
The next day, it was necessary to remake the first page.
There were sirens in the area.
The Bohorkes looked ready to defend of the policemen guarding them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the view of the whole Sinaloa, the employees of "Riodos" continued his case.
"How can you think about closing down," said Bohorkes, "if the same day Javier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to make a report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance it appears to be a statue, though of horror.
The researchers told that the first found remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhinoceros, discovered by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that the experts called him Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs. "
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of its cherry skin was reddish-brown - and to say that it had, in some way, a "dark past."
In the report, published in the journal "Modern Biology, it was described as the most well-preserved of in the history of finds and one of the best dinosaur copies in the world.
This is the fossil - a newly found instance of that lived in the middle of a melodic period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good fortune stunned researchers who call it a truly remarkable masterpiece.
This is the most well preserved fossil of this kind in the history of finds, according to articles in the journal National Geographic.
He was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the mine mine at the company's mine near Fort mcmurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled upon something that seemed to be different from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil discovered by them was sent to the Royal Tiirrel Paleontological Museum.
The next six years, there was carried out to work on the discovery of an animal inside the with a mass of 2,500 feet (1,100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
"It is worth only slightly squinting, and you can practically believe that he sleeps," said lead author Caleb Brown, a research fellow at the Royal Tierrell Paleontological Museum, where the creation is being demonstrated.
He will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved copies of the of the Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs. "
Studying his skin, the researchers found that it was a, despite the fact that it was covered with a and resembled a walking tank, apparently subjected to considerable danger from the carnivorous dinosaurs.
This dinosaur covered with a powerful shell used red-white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as protective painting, which is also enjoy many animals of our day.
This would allow him to merge more quickly with the environment and avoid meeting enemies, experts say, suggesting that he was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This 110 million years-year-old creature, which belongs to the family of, was widely covered in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrhenian Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already examined the animal and gave him the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the museum lab assistant Mark Mitchell, one of the group members, who spent more than 7,000 hours for his painstaking excavation.
The amazing preservation of the instance allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the drawing and shape of the scales and the pan plates on his body.
They found a protective colouring, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although protective coloring and well spread, the discovery came as a surprise, because the size of the dinosaur Borealopelta significantly exceeds the size of today's living animals with protective coloring.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred to disguise confrontation as a way of survival.
But most of modern animals with protective paint - for example, deer, zebras, or browns - are much smaller and are more accessible prey, suggesting that the nobility had to fight seriously for survival.
A serious threat from predators for a massive dinosaur covered with a powerful shell shows how dangerous were, the predatory dinosaurs of the Copper Period, "Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur shade also indicates that his skin should have been reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, seeking information about his life, including the preserved contents of his digestive tract to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he sunk and went down to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was so warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to spread much further inland than now.
"This nososaur is truly remarkable that it is completely covered preserved scaly skin, and at the same time completely preserved in three dimensions, the original form of the animal," Brown said.
As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked then, in the early melodic period.
It is not necessary to resort to imagination especially in order to recreate it, it is only a bit of a, and one can practically believe that it is asleep.
This is the age when giant teroons, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, were wandering around the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them Tyrannosaurus rex lived for millions of years later than Borealopelta, on the could hunt t-from his formidable ancestors.
Among them is an acronym, a 38 feet (11.5 metres long monster weighing six tons.
Scientists whose latest discoveries are published in the journal "Modern Biology" believe that Borealopelta was after death in the sea and mummified in the.
The creature was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the Millenium Mine near Fort mcmurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the staff of the museum, it is the most well-preserved tiger in the world, together with the skin and, and it is, from the muzzle to the poor bones.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five metres) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic sign was two twenty-six-inch spikes from the shoulders.
The researchers believe that this herbivorous tyreophore was hard on what is now Canada, until the flowing river took it to the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur retained its shell with precision to the smallest detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular instance are so well preserved that the remains of the skin are still covered with bumpy punk plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Gresko wrote in an article for the National Geographic magazine, such a degree of is rare, like winning the lottery. "
The longer I look at him, the more striking it seems.
The fossilized remains of the skin are still covered with rattles of the animal's skull.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, and his five fingers on it are turned upside down.
I can count the scales on his.
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia, and then Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did so without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
On the arrival of Saakashvili reports the Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which posted on its channel in a youtube video with his performance.
Saakashvili spoke at an event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw uprising against the Hitlerite troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start a in this language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched on the subject of cooperation with Poland, Georgia and also spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived him of his citizenship, a loyal politician learned while in the United States.
How he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is still unknown.
Earlier, former governor of the Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the questionnaire to obtain citizenship of Ukraine was forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill any questionnaires.
Investigation period in the case of Vainzikher and Olhovik extended until January
The term of the preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the group of companies "Renova" Evgeny Olkhovik and the head of the energy holding "T Plus" Boris Vainzikher extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, in the Basmanny court is the issue of extension of the accused house arrest.
The representative of SK at the meeting reported on the decision last time to extend the period of preliminary investigation.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the necessity of seizure and examination of a large number of documents, as well as the conduct investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation," - said the investigator.
He added that the suspects regularly gave bribes to the leadership of Komi.
Their total size is estimated at not less than a billion roubles.
According to the investigation,,, as well as well as the former head of CJSC "Complex Energy Systems" Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 led the company "Vimpelcom," transferred to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi bribes for establishing the most favorable tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for the creation of favorable conditions for business.
Vainzikher and Olhovik were detained, in Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin disappeared from the investigation and was declared on the federal wanted list.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question "What are the streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Britney Ferrell was shaken to the depths of the soul.
Just a day after arriving in New York City as part of a tourist trip, a native of St. Louis sat on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, viewing the Facebook feed on the phone.
She pushed for a post from high school.
They said, "Police have just killed an eighteen-year-old child, and he still lies in the middle of the street."
Paying attention to the fact that no one from her tape did not this information, puzzled, she closed the Facebook and opened the twitter.
In her tape there were many outposts of the user with the nickname @ TheePharoah.
A man from Greater St. Louis in real time rapper of the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black eighteen-year-old, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of Brown's lifeless body, which is in the street, where it will be four hours.
"It's a wild thing," Ferrell thought.
But death was not new for her and her circle.
She delayed the phone, and later in the evening returned to the tweet that people were going on Cannon drive.
There were photos signal tape and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father holding a poster with words: "A policeman from Ferguson has just killed my unarmed son!"
She looked at a direct broadcast as a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a latex dog.
On another video, another policeman, "she said," took the rifle, and said: "I'll kill you all... animals!"
"It's a non-standard situation," according to his own memories, then Ferrell said.
Thus it is not murder as those to which we are accustomed and which can be called typical.
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying.
She took a return flight and flew home the next day.
Having landed at 11 pm, she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson in the next almost three years was the subject of a new documentary film, "Chyi Streets?", which will be released on August 11.
This is a story about survival and protest, about love and loss, strength and resilience from the point of view of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrell went to Ferguson with his daughter dressed in a dress in and a wreath under color, they recalled a conversation that had been leading up to this morning countless times, the experience of black-skinned people and their plight.
She remembers how she said, "Remember how I told you how black people had to fight for what they believed?"
We are now going to Ferguson because a policeman killed eighteen-year-old boy, and it was wrong.
"I couldn't take it," Ferrell said later.
"What is happening today is the culmination of what happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it and brought up on it.
It must not only be well versed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of experience of black-skinned people and their position and what we must do to become free to be released.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she personally will not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel that it would have been a bad service if it had been fenced off from it. "
When they arrived at Ferguson, the first stop they made on Sat-Florissant Road, on a site located across the road from a police station, becoming something like a tent camp, as long as activists waited for reports of the final instigation of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell, with his daughter joined the local entrepreneur who was preparing lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped give them to the protesters.
On the other hand, Ferrell's mind had a new type of activism.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-Saint Louis, she was president of the Association of Sanitation Students, representatives of national minorities, and engaged in food justice and health disparities among black communities.
I didn't have the experience of the organizer.
This came to come for itself.
After a few weeks later, at the evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Folayan, one of his co-directors.
Folayan said that she and her chief operator, Lucas Alvaradow-, "just wanted to document the event.
Ferrell came up with a question: do you want to document, or try to find a story on which to play? "
This skepticism was inspired by numerous people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from his pain and.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the voices of people who were born and grew up in Ferguson don't get into the spotlight, and wanted to do it differently."
Folayan, then, has already teamed up with his co-director, Dale Davis, a local artist known for his activism on the subject of the death penalty.
His involvement aroused sympathy for the project at Ferrel and the six local residents with whom the project team, Mr. Chyi Streets? "
"In this documentary, not someone speaks for us or with us, we're talking about ourselves," Davis said.
"It was the most important thing for me how these people will be represented, because this is how I will be presented myself."
And although the aim of the project was not to focus on the experience of Ferrel Aristide in an effort to show that the movement is not about the leader-savior, but about how the community is united.
As a result, there is an unexpected personal aspects of Ferrell's life, for example, how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt hungry," said Ferrell, with a laugh telling about for the first time saw the finished product.
But I understood that when doing such work and humanizing blacks, there should be some level of vulnerability. "
In addition, the story of Ferrel again discusses and emphasizes the role of black gay women in the broader context of the movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement of those who created the <hash> BlackLivesMatter tag on social networks after the murder of black teenager Travonne Martin in 2012 - rank themselves as homosexuals.
"We are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden. "
Folayan agreed with this statement, noting that "the movement is actually supported by black women and many gay black women."
Nevertheless, she insists that this is not a case of positive discrimination, and that Ferrell was not elected as the central character of the film because of her distinctive features.
"She was the man who tried this energy," she said.
On the other hand, it is not a coincidence that it appeared to be on the first plan because when the FMLN
You can feel its energy through the screen.
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long been no film cameras, but there remain complex racial links between the community and the police.
Ferrell's two and a half years will be on probation for the highway during the demonstration.
It describes the social and political atmosphere of a place that calls home, simply: the. "
She is still on the, which she learned when she went to Ferguson's streets three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. "
Two Salvadoran footballers disqualified for U. S. bite

The first distinguished defender Henry Romero.
The Salvadorean was bitten by the attacker Joey Altidor, then pinned him by the chest.
Then halfback, while serving corner in the penalty area, US defender Omar González.
As a result Romero was disqualified for three matches, and Seren - on six.
The meeting ended with a victory of Americans with the score 2: 0, reports Goal.com.
The appearance of similarity: the artist creates portraits with the help of the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the centre of the hall at the Friedmann Gallery in New York from the ceiling on the wire, people's faces are - white, black and brown - all of which are elusive to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey Harborg from the brush strokes and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent cuts from Fort Levenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic cables on the website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called "The emergence of similarities."
This is the result of two years of correspondence between Duke Harborg, whose art combines technology, informatics and art, and Manning, a female transgender and a famous dissident, to whom Barack Obama softened his sentence just three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing the DNA computer program obtained from Manning, and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of individuals who could have been in people with such a gene, Duke Harborg has created a deep, though hard-to-understand manifesto, dedicated not only to the plasticity of DNA data - to the different ways of their interpretation and the ingenious determinism of these interpretations - but also to the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but from adolescence openly said he considers herself a woman, in 2013 was sentenced to 20 episodes, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photographs in prison were unavailable, so only one photo of her and was known: a black-white selfi, on which manning in a platinum shade of a wig, clearly feeling awkward, sits behind the wheel of a car; with this photo of her and began to associate.
In 2015, Jui-Harborg successfully completed his 2012 project "Visions of strangers."
In it the artist created portraits of unknown people with the help of forensic evidence of the type of and chewing gum, from this DNA debris and creating images of how these people could look.
And then she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," - said Duke Hagborg at the preliminary display of the new exhibition for the press.
At that time, Chelsea could not be visited and take pictures, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait created from her DNA.
In such an unusual way the artist and her sitting in the prison of the musa became friends through correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a book of "suppressed images," illustrated by Shoor Kanungo, who depicted how in the future the president will soften the punishment of Chelsea and will be able to visit the exhibition personally.
What Obama really decided to release Manning just days after the book's departure in light, it turned out to be a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong that the exhibition opens right now, when Donald Trump declares war on the people revealing secret information in the government, and invent new ways to stir up Twitter, which he is called upon to mitigate.
When Jui-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of this all over time, she said that "there is no accident."
In a statement of the artist, written on the wall, Manning's huge signature Menning displayed (with a heart instead of the "i" in her name) calls for an end to "automatic separation on the basis of gender, race, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar made of pencil C, G and A.
Having included 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist is exquisitely expressed), Duke Harborg hoped to show how we are all remarkably similar, at least in their biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not define what we are, how open genetic data is to, and how subjective it is," said Djui-Harborg.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition, which has been in one room, is the above novel in comics.
On it in the style of the King-Kong appears above the building of the United States Department of the with a loudspeaker in hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it is written there.
"So never stop."
"This is a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me," says the artist, who welcomed us from Philadelphia.
"I still have skin bumps when I speak about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it has been visibly portrayed in the comics - but when it comes she will be welcomed by the masks in the center of the room, her own gene simulators gathered like crowds of protesters.
This is also done intentionally, as well as everything at the exhibition up to the height (5 "2, the growth of Manning), on which the pencil were drawn genetic haplogroups.
"I would have developed them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," says Djui-Harborg about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that was formed around Chelsea as a movement that stood for its liberation."

That will help your company not become another » « Uber
Eimi Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among the employees of his startup in the field of-commerce, but the polls did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse,.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"It has never been consistent and objective," said Errett, who is a 75-person Madison Reed company based in San Francisco.
She therefore appealed to third parties for help.
Now there is a new kind of in the field of personnel, which help companies to find out how their employees feel.
Developing and licensing software, the of which is to measure involvement of employees, they allow companies to do express surveys, to address certain teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and for complaints, and in some cases allow informants to pass the top management and address directly to the directorate.
"Now we have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, and where is Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the "Glint" from Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
Errett said that she has achieved a greater understanding of what her employees think and feel her three years of.
In addition to the express surveys and questionnaires of certain teams the product offers a thermal map of the company and shows in a visual form, which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are gradually becoming aware that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become the next Spokesperson Uber, who was involved in the scandal, when a former employee published a post on the blog, which described an aggressive environment in which those who expressed dissatisfaction, punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire to control the situation - an opportunity for profitable business.
According to the of the Internet portal, "Let's talk about the payment of dividends devoted to financial technology, the industry of global governance, regulation and compliance by 2020 could cost more than $118.7 billion.
The from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year against the backdrop of a fall in Uber's reputation.
There are almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Recently, the Killer appeared among customers.
Like "Glint", "Convercent" allows companies to send customized opinion surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view the thermal maps of distressed areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the directorate.
Thus, the Court of Public Opinion intercepted power from the of the inspectors, "said Patrick Kvinlan, the founder and president of the company ».
If it turns out that the company poorly treats employees or behaves unethical, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company could face costly consequences in the form of boycotts by customers, of employees and lawsuits, said.
Kuwaiti Ruby Tuesday Greenville, "a network of more than 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, has used the Kuwaiti Convercent Awards for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures, and offer an easy way to the company's head office.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to search for a phone number or a head office, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
Often it was a frightening and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, head of the legal department of the company "Ruby Tuesday."
Now, when the company uses the Convergent service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states - such as discrimination,, and unfair pay can quickly detect and address them.
"I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of the employees," said Vitrano, who is in charge of the risk management team of the Kuwaiti Ruby Tuesday Committee.
And we protect our shareholders from litigation with the.
According to, companies began to more serious ethics, values and involvement in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of the Enron affair.
But it was only when social networks were widely distributed, companies realized that they could not be able to keep their dirty underwear from viral distribution on the net.
"Before starting to use technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both "Glint" and "Negotiating Convercent" offer their software as a service, requiring companies to pay a regular fee for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that received the approval of venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, the Company received $10 million in funding from firms such as "Sapphire Ventures" and "Tola Capital," as a result of which the company's total capital reached $47 million.
The Company received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the total capital of the company's to $60 million.
This is hardly surprising if one considers the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today's employees expect their jobs more than it used to be.
In markets with tough competition, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is only a necessary minimum.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they devote their time to the company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work in the company, they feel they are being heard, and that the work they do brings a result, they are more trying to make such a company successful," says Nina mcquin, vice president for global benefits and employee satisfaction at linkedin, where both "" and "Glint" are used.
Investors get income when companies from their portfolio go well; companies go well when employees are committed and involved.
If third party analytical tools promise to increase the dedication and involvement of employees, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to culture experts at the workplace, it is important to have data on employee involvement.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees about feedback, it can create the impression that changes are coming.
And if changes do not come fast enough, or not come at all, disappointment may develop, and employees will lose interest.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be ready to carry out 4,000 conversations," says Russell Rat, president of a consulting firm at Kotter International, who had to see how companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't go to the end, employees will guess:" You heard me true?
Do you?
And if you don't care why I shouldn't be all the same?
According to Errett, the company » « Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action on the same day, when it reports about the problem with the help of Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees unhappy with the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
In the long term, this knowledge will help it more effectively keep employees in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Witrano.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.

The Bruins team has to be engaged longer because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled training twice a day
Time is approaching eleven in the evening; a crowd of football players from the University of California in Los-Angeles delayed to chat on one side of the team's new training fields on campus.
Some of them snapped their T-shirts, exposing their back, brilliant from sweat after the intense first day of the sports camp.
For many team players, these minutes idling make a break in the middle of the day.
After three hours of training, will go back to the dormitories to prepare for final exams, and the next morning they will return to the Wasserman football centre at 6: 30.
Shortly before Monday turned on Tuesday, Bruce's team coach Jim Mora said: "in the next three days of these guys are waiting for a."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled the training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the workload for the players, actually lengthened their working day at least until the end of exams on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three training of the team of the University of California in Los-Angeles was scheduled for 7: 15 pm to be placed in an already tight schedule of players.
The side effect of the absence of two workouts a day has become a number of the days with one training, and the Bruins moves the beginning of camp for almost a week compared to last year and conducts training during summer school for the first time in six seasons in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to hold 18 training sessions until August 20 inclusive before starting the official preparations for the first game of the season against the team of the Texas A & M University in September.
Mora said he supports changing the rules on the part of the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that one more item appeared in the tight schedule of players.
"For three or four days we give them this huge burden, it's a serious test," Mora said.
And they just overcome it, they work, they are wonderful guys.
I think that when we live till Saturday and we will have more time, it will be really cool.
When the camp ends, the University of California in Los-Angeles will make the training closed; it is not easy task, as its fields are in direct sight from the adjacent parking lot and from the neighboring town of Laskin, a expensive hotel that has already been bombarded by football balls that have overcome the protective net behind the gate.
Players from the Brussels Bruins must occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when rooms are free during the season, there could be a problem.
"We will have security guard," Mora said.
This is a serious problem, and I don't exaggerate the danger, suggesting that someone can take off the room, sit there and record training on the video.
If you have a video recording training, it is very serious.
But we will have security there and there will be security in the parking number 8.
We will do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much.
We have a plan. "
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg are discharged from hospitals
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg metro in April are discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of the vice-governor Anna Mityanina.
According to the end of July, three people remained in hospitals, "TV Center."
We remind that the explosion in the metro of St. Petersburg warmed on April 3 this year.
The bomb detonated suicide bomber Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the attack 15 people were killed, as well as the performer.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
Recall, on the eve of Rospotrebnadzor recommended Petersburg metro to review the plan of measures to ensure transport safety, in particular, increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook reinforces factored in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of, independent experts, and show their conclusions under the original posts, said on Thursday the world's largest social network, which is trying to fight the so-called fake news.
In a statement on its web site, the company said that it is beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognise possible hoaxes, send them to check, and possibly show the results of the fact-checker under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news, which many believe has influenced the 2016 presidential election in the US.
This issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false messages before the presidential election in May, and in Germany before the September elections declared support for the plan to fine social networks if they did not promptly delete posts inciting hatred.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in the German language Facebook reported testing of a new fact-checker algorithm, which was launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition, to see what messages are being challenged by independent verifiers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and share," wrote in his block Sarah Sue, manager of the Facebook news feeds.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the function of "related articles" and work on other changes in the news tape to solve the problem of fake news.
Create a romantic comic: one castle in English history
In the recent past, 's tiny castle was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 1970 s and 80 s served as a haven for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy place in the valley of the River Bul in the county of Kent he watched a tumultuous story around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, Yorkshire with a spear hair and with a penchant for historical documents, on a novel comic.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the of a man who died 300 years ago," he says with enthusiasm.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
"The Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Ewardian era and tells about the families who lived in Scott; each story illustrated one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkevitch, Brian May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book Rhodes, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "The teeth of a dead man and Other Stories" - a collection of documents from the British Library; this project unexpectedly touched him to the depths of his soul.
"I could be moved just a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the by a double agent who worked for," he says.
"It's of his finger"
And letters always smell smoke, because in those days fire was lit for lighting.
И через 300 years, in the future, вам кажется, что вы тоже там.
Ah, how I love the archives! "
For a man, covered by a passion for old papers, to get support from the National Fund and the English Art Council and to live in the castle four months ("Honestly, I was living there") seems too good to be true.
For days he studied the "new" Victorian castle, walked on the archives and considered numerous treasures of the estate and old things - for example, heads of hyenas on walls or bottles, centuries lying in the.
He walked around the park and on the ruins of the old castle, spoke to the, gardeners and sometimes with artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
Then at night he "drank whisky and sat down to write."
The history of the castle of Scotni is not very studied, because the National Fund gained full access to it only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassi died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff only began to deal with the archive, which he describes as "that the aristocrats have slipped into the attic."
Diaries, letters of the times of the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "you think that the land disputes are boring," - says Rhodes, "- but for this birch fought two families.
And so, guys! "
In some stories, the castle becomes the starting point for wider explorations in English history: for example, in the "worker," the hero leaves the newly constructed castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
"There is information about the riot, which occurred in the castle in 1380, in a book called" The royal family of Kent and Sussex, "- says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in these places, and I thought that the rebellion was a suitable beginning.
Maybe they were connected? "
Other stories are tightly connected with the history of the castle - for example, "The Priest," which tells about the priest-Jesuit, whom the Darrelov family had been hiding for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "," about an 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral, the coffin (it was discovered in a few years, when the coffin was dug).
Darrelly is Rodsa's favorite family of all that was inhabited by Scott: "gentlemen, it seems, were a perfect scam, eternally going into debt and spent money on something they could not afford.
In different generations of men -Darreals solved their problems with debts, married the wealthy elderly women - I imagine them as a company of cute guys, who can care for the heirs of big states. "
After finishing work at the castle, Rhodes looks for other opportunities to get a unique writer experience.
He lived for two weeks in Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elemämäki - a place where at the beginning of the 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it again grew up in the.
But Scott remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this: damn, I have to go back to real life again."
Fifteen largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) develops: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, and FC Discovery, seven more credit institutions are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the share of the ARB organizations that will account for at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a way out - all the banks that have a break with the ARB, are negotiating with another public organization uniting credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia," which is headed by the well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Market, recognized, by the way, following the results of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma Committee and deputy on the number of prepared bills.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was made during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the Inter-regional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, a new classification of banks depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, president of the ARB, said that, in the opinion of the association, this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which thus try to limit the of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims, there was criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justifiably carry out the of licenses from some banks, which, however, was followed by an objection from the representative of the Central Bank: many heads of the past banks, in particular, the Foreign Industry Bank, were in the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in highly sensitive to the relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment and became visible reason to fifteen largest banks, saying disagreement with the policy of the ARB, began to prepare for joining the association "Russia," noting that "the effectiveness of the ARB will be at a low level, and a constructive dialogue within the banking community actually is not carried out."
Depositors will be better
How will end?
Let us answer immediately the main question that arises at the slightest failure or conflict in banking or next to it: depositors are not at risk, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
The head of "Russia" Anatoly Aksakov, known for his sensitivity in all that the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional, highly appreciated by the Central Bank: almost all the leadership of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator pass through expert assessments of "regionals."
There are obviously no special shocks in the personnel and organizational plan.
Unquestionably, ARB falls into a difficult financial and managerial situation after losing such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest - established in 1991 - an organization protecting the interests of the banking community, there is little potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the of monetary circulation as a.
It cannot be said that, in the association "Russia" with open arms ready to take on any terms of new members, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("will have too much desire"), who, on July 21 at a briefing in the press-centre of the Parliamentary newspaper, stated that "literally the next day representatives from the ARB banks asked me to consider the possibility of the potential of our association" Russia. "
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, and to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
Now there is a negotiation process, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the international banking forum.
There and we will be.
Also Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "for the chair doesn't hold up", called the possible new head of the updated association "Russia" Georgy Luntovsky, who leaves in September the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, highly describing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now vacationing in Crimea, plans to his vacation one day interrupting leave and arrive in Moscow, at an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association "Russia," where it is scheduled to consider the agenda of the extraordinary congress of "Russia."
The entrance of cars with petrol engine in the large cities of Russia will not be restricted to
Deputy Head of the Ministry of Transport Nikolay Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with gasoline engine in the large cities of Russia will not be restricted.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that it is necessary to gradually raise the ecological class.
And there the concept immediately switch to zero emissions.
I believe that technically we are not ready for it.
The question: what year?
This is the same at the level of slogans - let's forbid.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
The whole city will close?
"In 20 years - I don't know, maybe it will happen," - quotes Prime Minister's words.
Earlier, the newspaper "Izvestia" reported that by August 17, the vice-premier Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study the proposals on possible variants of state support of electric transport, presented to the government by the general director of PJSC KamAZ Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of vehicles with the in large cities and resorts.
Washington changes the rules for obtaining a greencard.
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that a new immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining a green card will be.
The plan calls for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are offered by the Republican Party and are supported by the president.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so by changing the way the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who own English, have monetary resources that allow them to support themselves, and possess skills that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, according to American media.
The appearance of sex robots is real, and it should bother us
It was not possible to think that 2017 could no longer get worse, a new report on technological successes in the production of sex robots was released.
.
Sex robots are now in the spotlight.
The Fund for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to the Noel Sharki, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must take them seriously.
Users will be able to choose the eye color of the robots, the shape of the, and the type of nails.
"People are giggling about this, but firms are already in large numbers sending them to consumers, and soon we will see them much more," said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls evolved from their inflatable fellows in robots with silicon skin, warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas that are controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "customize" their robots to their liking, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and shape of the robot nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality," in comparison with which Stepford wife would appear very progressive, worries even stronger.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the firm realbotix robot allows users to customize the quality robots they find attractive - for example, shy.
There are still Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by the "True Companion," which come with an already programmed individuality - for example, "Cold Farrah" makes an impression shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "bold" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits perfectly," - the site "True Companion website.
So she loves what you love, does not love what you don't like, and so on.
It is the mood during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she can "be in the mood"! "
There is much concern in the emergence of sex-robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but most of the subordinate image of the woman, the association with rape, which causes the possession of the Cold (read: resisting).
On the site "True Companion" Roxxxy compared to the vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can be a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" - the site says.
But these sex robots are not just fetish or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicates something darker and deeper in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with submission as an optional supplement.
Most of the men will certainly not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be quite instructive with regard to the meanings of the age in which we live.
And many people are not bad and are not aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It is not a coincidence that these complex sex-robots appeared exactly when women's rights around the world were threatened when the White House is a president who boasted about women.
The most terrible thing in the TV series "The story of the" - not graphic images, twisted bodies and the rendered eyes, namely how this vision seems realistic.
The Galad Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it doesn't seem so big.
The goal of the sex robots industry is to achieve such physical similarity to real women (only with the proportion of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to seem like humans to the touch to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is their "characters" that robots don't like real women.
They cannot break with their partners or move away from them.
They have neither their own life nor biography - anything that could indicate independence or something else that could destroy the illusion of full dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, they are.
A native of Los-Angelo Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, since 2013 playing for the national team of Ukraine, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which starts on August 31.
This was reported by the general manager of "blue yellow" Andrey Lebedev in an interview with the portal BeBasket.
We tried to negotiate with, but, unfortunately, he won't come for family reasons.
We will go to EuroBasket without a naturalized player, because we don't want to take a person whom we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
Let me remind you: with the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian team took a record sixth place in the Eurobasket-2013 and for the first time got to the World Basketball Championship, where the "yellow-blue" to overcome the group stage, and a native of the USA gathered an average of 15.4 points per game, made 3 selections and gave 5 assists.
Jeter stopped playing for the national team of Ukraine from the moment of leaving the post of the head coach of our national team American Mike Fratello, who left this post in 2015.
The's Eurobasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team matches of the group's on the.
At the Trust Eugene Murzin in Group B there will be five duels: with Germany (on August 31), Italy (September), Georgia (3-2), Lithuania (5 th) and Israel (6 th).
Within preparation for the tournament, our men's team carried out two control duels in which conceded to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's Great feat?
To portray the Portraying Mita Romney Restriction seems quite reasonable
In the Trump era, a common place was the fact that political disputes that polarized the American electorate at the micro level had broken some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers have been writing columns on how to deal with the horrible relatives voting for Trump.
It seems we are all tense so that will soon burst.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I am writing about this because my cousin, a left-leaning poetess from Chicago, who has long been at odds with the Republicans in his family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that in the fight against a common enemy could have a strong effect.
At Trump in the White House, all she knows, including a Republican brother, with whom she has been argued about politics for decades, sudden and strangely, is on one side.
Over dinner this is undoubtedly good; but I cannot help thinking that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump breathed forces into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule may all move to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will cease to be struck by his tricks.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the backdrop of his standards, will suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself on the fact that I really miss Mitt Romney's old-fashioned madness - with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14-percent income tax (but we at least knew how his tax declaration looks like) - compared to Trump, both seem very little evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with children on the carousel in Central Park - the largest carousel in the New York City Department of Parks and the best way in the city to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
Horses Grozny and huge, pictures from fiberglass on the central drum - grimace clowns and animals which, having bent, in horror look to their on a back, is extremely ominous, and links music, ironically, to delight.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: the views from the skyscrapers are out of, the silhouettes of the buildings too came to cause awe, and the reality of the city does not have time to dream.
Thirty five years have passed, and I still experience the day when I learned that the Suissa cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet (the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage "is not in the), but a large circular crossbar in North London.
A carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a child of two years old, a child of eleven years and two women for forty can have a great time.
If I could put an estimate, I would put the five, but fortunately, no one asked me about it.
And in the department store this week I was asked before carrying out a card terminal, to the "experience" of shopping on a scale from one to five stars.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street all the same plus the option to accompany an estimate of tea at 15 percent - this is for the order.
As a result, not only is the interaction neutral on the idea slowing down, but also have to make a personal attitudes into a situation that does not imply it.
The poor salesperson at the department store smiled flexibly while I was tired of my experience of giving her credit card in five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital because of chest pain
Pistorius leaves prison for a visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year he was transferred to hospital to treat cuts on wrists, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of of a fall in the cell.
The was convicted of premeditated murder following an appeal by the prosecutor's office for an initial sentence for involuntary manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, firing her several times through the door of the toilet room in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius stated that he took his girlfriend for a night thief hiding in his toilet.
The prosecutor's office announced the intention to file another protest, this time against the six-year term of Pretoria, which, according to her, is too butcher.
The Prosecutor General's Office has stated that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal will be reviewed later this year.
The term of Pretoria may be increased by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The suspect in the beating of the journalist NTV has been elected
Capital law enforcement officers have chosen a measure of restraint in the form of a subscription for non-departure for the man who attacked the journalist NTV television channel Nikita Razvozzhayev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
It is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
"As part of the investigation of the criminal case brought under Article 116 of the Criminal Code (" Pwallpaper ") against a 32-year-old man, who hit in the face of a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation named Gorky, the suspect was elected a measure of suppression in the form of a subscription for non-departure and proper behavior," - specified Volk.
The representative of the Interior Ministry added that an administrative protocol for disobeying the police has been drafted against the suspect.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast to the Day of the, a man approached the correspondent and hit his face.
As it turned out later, the bully has nothing to do with the Airborne Forces.
According to, the, on the contrary, tried to detain Muscovite.
Two Bulgarian citizens have been detained in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking lot.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people who were detained in Sithonia, placing tents in the wrong place, including two citizens of Bulgaria.
They were released the same day, while the investigation was still underway.

The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing serious fines on all who are caught during parking in a place not intended for this purpose.
Checks will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The Russian Foreign Ministry accused US Vice President of Cold War rhetoric
Statements made during the European tour of US Vice-President Michael Pence were criticized by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"It is regrettable that Washington is increasingly sliding into primitive ideologized stamps of the Cold War, which are completely detached from reality," the Russian Foreign Ministry foreign policy agency said in a statement.
So the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to the words of Pence about the "Russian threat" and attempts to forcibly redraw borders, which he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of choice "or with the West, or with Russia" and the of a thesis on the supposedly uncontested all Yugo-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States violated international law by using force to reject Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
"We call on American colleagues to stop the of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is invariably based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual interests," the Russian Ministry said in a statement.

Grigory Leps: "I'm going to fight, though 55 - not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage Grigory Leps will celebrate its 55 th anniversary next Sunday.
Before the celebration the singer talked to the columnist "Izvestia."
I remember your "crawler."
Special tent in "Luzhniki," Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday, a powerful salute over the Moscow river.
You probably thought then how would like to carry out the next five-year plan.
Intentions have come true?
If we talk about the profession, it was a successful period.
I worked a lot, three times traveled with touring the whole country, and gave 120-130 concerts a year.
Released two good albums.
Of course, I am the, say, 20 years ago.
Biological clock does not deceive.
To sing as I sang in the 30, it is becoming heavier.
Nevertheless I rush into fight, I don't want to stop.
And I with new people, it seems to me, come to other level.
With them and the new album write, the first in three years.
Yes, work on it is now.
Actually, we have all recorded in my studio and now will send it to the in Los-Angeles.
It is called "You are what is so serious?" according to the song written together with Timati.
It is not quite ready yet, so we have not posted it.
We will do it later, when the clip on it will be removed.
And the album will be presented in November - to a series of my jubilee concerts in Moscow "Crocus City Hall."
To your new disc, a cool American drummer Chris Cowman made his hand.
You, it seems, wanted it and in the tour structure to attract?
In my opinion, Coleman is today one of the most outstanding drummers of the world.
He came to me in the studio, recorded his party.
I offered him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects. - "Izvestia") offered.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
It was about fees from €35,000 to €45,000 per month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space I will find worthy musicians.
And I found excellent drummer Max Malysheva.
It's better to feed your own (smiles).
At times, I want some of them to fight, not for that.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly quoted at the international level.
It is written by Western music magazines and invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wai, having listened to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists has, with another executive technique."
Your album is in Los-Angeles, American musicians are cooperating with you, but you're still in the U. S., can't you?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Now,, I don't do.
There are a number of lawyers who are involved in this issue.
As a musician, I really feel sorry that I can't get to America.
I said that I was studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful.
We don't dull them, but we don't have such experience, schools.
In front of our performers of popular music for 70 years, there were absolutely no tasks that American musicians always decided.
They sought the highest quality sound.
And I try to follow the same principles.
For now, the has denied me entry for ten years.
But I still every year I will apply for a visa at the British embassy to once again allowed to drive there and the most important thing is to work there.
The rest of Europe regards me favorably.
And already in August, you will have a concert in Monaco, not registered, but poster, right?
Yes, there is a good room in Monte-Carlo "," I once performed there already.
Now invited again, and, as far as I know, all tickets for the concert have already sold out.
Will you go to "Laima Vaikule," which will start on July 20 in Jūrmala?
She invited me, and I certainly responded.
Lyme is a wonderful singer and a magnificent woman, able to serve herself and a wonderful vocal, and even a whisper.
After touring and jubilee concerts, as far as I know, you want to appeal to Vladimir Vysotsky's.
Two albums with his songs you already have in the discography.
When the third?
Probably next year.
But it will be completely different.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky about the same filing as he did himself.
Only voice and guitar.
No other arrangement.
Our famous musician Timur Vedernikov will accompany me.
We will try to get involved in the album and Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum.
I have spoken with him this topic, we have a good relationship, but he is a busy person, so we will see how it is.
You and Boris Grebenshchikov's songs gradually entered the repertoire.
, Then, the album of his stuff will come?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I met him several times and asked: can I sing this or that song?
He said: "Gregory, I write songs to be performed."
Please try, sing.
Probably, it is interesting and such an album to record.
So far I don't have such a task, but in the future, two years later, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I may make such a project.
If you do not focus entirely on the affairs of your production center.
I suppose, as long as you haven't realized its potential yet, didn't signed contracts with all the artists who you are interested in?
There are a number of performers I would have dreamed of having under my wing, but they are independent, well-established people.
Do you mean Sergei Lazarev?
Seryozha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can disagree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov whom I led in "Voice."
We signed a contract with him and work.
In our pop music such singers are rare.
I will be sincerely sorry if he does not reach those heights, which is worthy.
I try to pick up my repertoire, shoot clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: buy them songs, I pay poets, sometimes their tracks fall in the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
At the exit they will receive a recorded album, several clips.
And then, if they want, can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I will be pleased if one of them will achieve commercial success and will pay me interest, about which we agreed in the contract.
But if it doesn't, it's not going to block oxygen.
Let all work, break, prove, as when I argued.
If tomorrow you will be offered to make a tour tour across Ukraine and guarantee entry into the country, will you go?
I am still invited there.
It is about closed events.
And as for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, Russian, on my own conviction flew to Syria on the that plane, which then crashed.
If tomorrow will that it is necessary to fly to any other point in the interests of the state, - I will fly.
And I'm afraid that bloggers and other critics will think about me.
I sincerely regret that this situation has happened to Ukraine.
Since I believe: we are one people and have to be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to succeed, at least in the near future.
And earlier I gave for a year in Ukraine on 4050 concerts.
Met as nowhere.
Very rewarding public.
And I with several Ukrainian artists collaborated: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artyom Loika...
In Ukraine there are a lot of gifted people, and it is a sincere pity that they can't fully throw out the talent on a wide Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would gladly invite some cool Ukrainian performer to Russia, for example, Slava Vakarchuk, and made a joint concert with him.
But, I think, at the time, this is unlikely...
Andrei Ocotton kova transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known "Kommersant," the technical director of the cosmodrome Vostochny Andrey Okhlopkov began work at the State Space Research and Production Center (SCNTC).
He had previously been involved in the construction of the cosmodrome, but because of disagreements with the management of the Centre for Land and Space Infrastructure (CEKI), he was transferred to the company in Moscow Fili, where he would coordinate production.
Mr. Okhlobakov won't have a change: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished, and the functionality will be raised by the departments of the Central Bank.
The technical director of the Eastern and Deputy Director General Director of the Central Committee for Technological Development Andrei Ohlobakov went to work at the of Khrushchev's name, "Kommersant told top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as an employee of the government.
"He has been working on a new post for several weeks," - said the "Kommersant" in the industry.
It was not possible to get an operative comment on Thursday, and Mr. Okhlopkov was unavailable for comment.
However, the information "Kommersant" officially confirmed in.
He decided to move to the position of director of production coordination, - said at the enterprise. - Andrey Okhlopkov assigned to him the task of the starting minimum for the first launch at the cosmodrome Vostochny fully fulfilled.
Mr. Okhlopkov moved to the in 2013, having a service in space troops, in particular at Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" cosmodrome held the post of the first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Okhlobkov became the defendant in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly from his filing regional merchants received for kickbacks state orders, but did not comply with the undertaken obligations to clean up the separate parts of the rocket carriers in the Arkhangelsk region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The responsibilities for technological development assigned to it in the CECCA were extended to different projects, but the main one was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
The then Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, said in an interview with Kommersant that the situation in the East "was critical in October 2013."
The fact is that a strategic error was made when planning: the completion of construction and the first launch of the Soyuz 2.1 rocket carrier were scheduled for the same time - the end of 2015.
To implement the launch before the end of the year, the construction of the building was decided six months earlier and deadlines shifted from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, it was necessary to go on a trick: specialists of CENTCA began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment at unfinished facilities.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrey Okhlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and the ongoing transfer (instead of December 2015 "Soyuz" flew only on April 28, 2016), this idea justified, says the source of "Kommersant" at the cosmodrome: "otherwise we would still not have carried out a single launch from the East, but would be engaged in construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who supervised the creation of the cosmodrome, in a joke called Andrei Ohlobakov for his "space Susanitary", but he almost always requested information about the progress of the construction.
For example, in an interview with "Kommersant," he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroy) of the status of the only performer on the Eastern and directly work with subcontractors: "why should we put all eggs in one basket Special building?"
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, the has assumed the duties of general contractor in order to complete construction and installation work at the start-up and technical complex.
According to "Kommersant," the reason for the transition of Mr. Okhlopkov to a new place of work was the disagreement with the leadership of the CEKI regarding ways to complete the construction of the cosmodrome buildings and complexes, as well as methods of working with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that it would be better for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the construction.
An employee of the government, in turn, calls the decision strange: "he was one of the best specialists, to find him an equivalent replacement will be difficult."
According to "Kommersant," this will not be required: the post of technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be raised by the departments of the Central Committee.
In music schools, there will be two specialties training program
In the future students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Svyatoslav Golubenko, for this purpose it is possible to the students repeating disciplines, and the issue with the payment of other classes in the second specialty to solve with the help of special grants, reports "RIA Novosti."
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and we, together with the expert community we will develop a mechanism that will allow to develop two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," - said.
Last Friday, in the course of Vladimir Putin's "Non-children's" with the pupils of the children's "Sirius" student Maria Andreeva said that he had to pay for the repetitive items in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said she studied for the class violin and piano and has awards competitions in both directions.
The head of state acknowledged her issue very relevant and promised to help.
A 17-year-old Russian has been detained in Mexico by the a
In Mexico detained 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who was on the wall on the roof of a tall building, said the portal El Universal.
The incident took place in the capital city of Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, moved through a three-metre fence into the territory of the company's office buildings, Nestle, and independently took to one of its towers.
At the same time he didn't use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
The young man already on the roof.
The employees of the Ministry of Public Security lowered him to the ground in a helicopter.
After that, he was sent to the National Migration Institute.
They find out whether the young man is legally in the country.
Meanwhile, a video with a young man climbing to the top has become popular on the Web.
Users called the young man "a human spider."
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help to ease the.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests otherwise: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help relieve symptoms in those who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases.
This incurable disease, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the UK, leads to and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually to mitigate the symptoms patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from Washington University have established that the main amino acid protein tryptophan promotes the production of immune cells that increase the tolerance of the intestines.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the intestines keep in mind that the harmful germs coming with food did not penetrate the body.
Cells that are capable of launching inflammatory processes are balanced by cells that increase tolerance while protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance too severely disturbed aside inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacteria in the intestines appear to increase cell tolerance of the.
And this bacteria needs tryptophan - one of the building elements of protein - to launch the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "we have established a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is part of the normal intestinal microbioma, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan contained in the nutrition of mice, the more these immune cells they had. "
He suggested that the same thing would work in humans: the combination of L. reuteri and the rich tryptophan diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation of the intestine.
Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganvas, studying a variety of increasing tolerance of immune cells, found that one group of experimental mice had these cells, and another group, which belonged to the same line, but contained separately, they were not.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by microbios of bowel mice - communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract. "
The DNA of bowel cells was sequenced, and six species of bacteria present in mice with immune cells were, but missing from mice without them.
Mice grown in a sterile environment, who had no good microbioma and did not develop this type of immune cells, received L. reuteri, and their immune cells have appeared.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers have bred L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of fluid - without bacteria - to underdeveloped immune cells separated from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan processing, known as indol -3-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells also fell twice.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same increasing tolerance of cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the byproducts of the tryptophan from L. reuteri contribute to the development of cells in humans just as in mice, but in people suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases have been discovered defects in the genes associated with tryptophan.
She says: "perhaps the development of these cells and we need to be strengthened, because these cells depend on inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestine.

The revisit for the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to the records of the armed forces given to TIME magazine, the White House's decision last month to drive a Marine Corps helicopter on the South lawn for an American industrial production event cost taxpayers an entire $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One", when the president is on board, became a central element of the 17 July White House event, which featured American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, vice president Mike Pence, and senior White House officials viewed technological products from all fifty states.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was exhibited next to a yacht from the state of Maine, a firefighter from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Corps (HMX-1), the helicopter management department, the White House Military Administration ordered the presence of a private helicopter, or the FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South lawn on the occasion of an unusual event.
I just wanted you to make sure that you are aware, because this is an unusual widely publicized event in the press, "wrote Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail to his boss, the first deputy chief of aviation of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter stated that the helicopter will arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a. m. on July 17 to participate in an event scheduled for 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and will remain there before the lawn will be released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter added that if the departure from the White House is delayed, the second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with the time constraints.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and units remained near the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was unclear whether the second crew was required as a result.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event contradicts this decision.
"Among other things, we asked whether this was a violation of the Hatch law, and we were told that there was no slander," wrote the.
"It looks like you have nowhere to go," the deputy chief replied.
The event "Made in America" was announced by the White House as an official event, and the Hatch law did not apply to it.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the president made efforts to promote the health care reform that was at that time in the Senate, and praised the attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft, known as "Marine One and Air Force One" for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But ask them only for photo opportunities.
Trump has already been the subject of discussions in February, when the presidential plane drove in the background during his first campaign rally in Melbourne, in Florida, and his Twitter account was filled with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
The White House is delighted with the presentation of the "Made in America" of the, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials, "- said the deputy press secretary of the White House Press Secretary Lindsey Walters.
Crews HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington agglomeration and on the South lawn of the President of the United States to train transportation to the White House with precision to an inch.
When Trump was at the G 20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 training sessions at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight performed for the event "Made in America" was counted by the crew in the account of the necessary training flights for a month.
Helicopters of the unit on that day also flew 11 additional hours in the framework of the non-presidential tasks of providing support.
According to the White House, taxpayers did not levy costs for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said that the company did not take part in the helicopter demonstration on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to the Ministry of Defence's hourly rates for 2017 fiscal year, the Ministry of Defence's reimbursement rate for VH-3D is $24,380 per hour flight.
In the records of the unit recorded that the time of in the air was 30 minutes in each direction from its airfield based on the base of Kuantiko Marine Corps in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is far below that rate.
"The cost for taxpayers, based on the approximate rate of reimbursement, is completely wrong," says Walters.
"These approximate rates include personnel, and many other irreversible costs, which are included in the annual assimilation of.
According to a study conducted in 2015 by REM Corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but, indeed, take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and expenses specified in the contract.
At that time, the former press secretary of the White House, Sean Spicer, spoke out in defense of the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to demonstrate things done in America this week," said.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I assume, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose workplace depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
That is why, of course, it is appropriate to draw attention to this.
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter, the southern lawn during the event, but he was exactly sitting in the driver's seat in a fire vehicle.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of the company "Sikorsky", joking with the press on the subject of its own fleet of company products.
"I have three of them.

The PSG has made it clear that it will not let the Italian player to the national team under any conditions, and now it is likely that Barcelona feels the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neymar.
