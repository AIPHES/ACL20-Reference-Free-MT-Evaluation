Last minute: Cosmic Visits Giant Asteroid 2014 JO25
There are billions, maybe even more gigantic meteorites in the Solar System that can go wild and cause serious consequences when hit.
These objects, which may have closed or open trajectories from the formation of the Sun, can sometimes pass through the Earth.
Asteroid 2014 JO25, which is 650 meters in diameter, will pass through such a visitor and today at 1.25 million km, which is closest to the world at 14:24 o'clock.
Over the years, we have become more aware of such news.
This is the most important pedigree observation techniques and improvements in observation instruments.
We have the possibility to identify the smaller asteroids, which can not be determined previously.
For example, last January, an asteroid in bus size passed only a half distance (~ 250,000 km) of Earth and Moon distance.
And the more interesting asteroid could be determined only a few days before the passage.
So there may be other cosmic buses that are supposed to be superimposed.
Imagine if you get an indication that an asteroid 20 meters in diameter will fall right in the middle of your neighborhood, what do you do?
In fact, the asteroids in this dimension do not destroy your neighborhood, but probably all the windows of buildings will explode.
This will be due to the shock waves that are emitted from the asteroid that will explode in the atmosphere.
For example, the asteroid falling to Russia in 2013 was in these dimensions and was enough to break up the windows of buildings in several cities.
However, if you have a target in the direction of an asteroid 100 meters in diameter, we recommend that you go at least 50 km away from your local area.
Criteria such as the size of the asteroid and the angle of impact are the determinants of the depth of the crater to be formed and the damage to the impact.
Let's look at several scenarios according to the simulation of the European Space Agency.
If an asteroid with a diameter of 100 m hits Earth at a speed of 60 km at a 45 degree angle, it will form a crater with a depth of about 250 meters and a diameter of 1200 meters.
The impact is equivalent to a 6-magnitude earthquake based on the Richter scale, and even if you are 10 miles from the point of impact, your body will have a third degree burn.
For 50 km, the broken window panes will be waiting.
If an asteroid of about 1 km is hit, the situation becomes even more depressing.
If an asteroid hit the Earth at the same angle and speed, it will form a crater about 600 meters deep and 12 kilometers in diameter.
So a whole neighborhood turns into a krat and disappears instantly.
Even if you are 100 km away from the point of impact due to the heat generated by the impact, your body will come to a third degree burn.
The impact is equivalent to an 8-magnitude earthquake based on the Richter scale.
The damage caused by the asteroid is not only dependent on the chemical composition of the asteroid but also on the rock structure of the region that it strikes.
The above values are given in the context of a scenario where a hard rock-like asteroid falls into a zone of sedimentary rocks.
If the asteroid is mostly composed of iron, the crater size will increase by 3 times and the disaster caused by it will be folded.
66 million years ago, something worse happened to the dinosaurs, and they suffered a catastrophic event that resulted in the collapse of an asteroid about 10 km in diameter.
Because of the asteroid strike, 75 percent of the sea and land creatures were instantly destroyed.
If you are targeting this huge asteroid world that destroys dinosaurs, be sure to leave the planet as the most robust option.
Every day, tons of stuff fall down to the world.
Most of them are burning in the atmosphere.
Some large enough meteorites are burning in the atmosphere, causing flares, commonly known as star skidding.
Let's finish our writing with another news that will comfort the interior.
Studies show that a giant asteroid will not hit the Earth as it will cause very serious destructions during the next 300-400 years.
I am relieved to see a certain amount of life for 70 years.
Flash claims to Medel: 10 million euros!
Gary Medel, who is certain to leave the name Black on the agenda of Inter, who wants to reinforce the Stoper territory ...
The 30-year-old footballer who has started to work with Inter again after having worn his shirt in the Confederations Cup with his Chilean form, is expecting future offers.
Gazzetta dello Sport, one of the prestigious Italian newspapers, has suggested that for Medel, who can serve in both the stopper and the pre-libero region, Besiktas has offered Inter a 10m euros bid.
Black-and-whites presented to Medel, the answer is expected from both sides, said the Chilean soccer player in Istanbul with his family looked at life warmly.
Despite Gazzetta's claim, the Black Eagle, which is under the FFP restriction, is hardly able to pay a price of 10m euros for Medel.
Black-and-whites are transferred to Caner Erkin for the first time, and there is a possibility that the star player will be added to the castle if he goes to Medel via leasing or if there is a serious reduction in his bonservice.
Besiktas Negredo announced the transfer to the stock market
Human rights group released travel warnings for Missouri
The National Colored People Progressive Association issued a warning for colorful people traveling to Missouri, due to the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The Missouri state NAACP Travel Advisory Committee recommends that African-American travelers pay special attention and be extremely cautious as they travel past the province, as noted by African-American travelers, as the Missouriese have recently come to fancy around the state on suspicious, race-based incidents."
The NAACP said that a new Missouri law makes it harder for people to win discrimination cases, while at the same time targeting the minority disproportionately to the state's law enforcement, the group is effective in publishing this travel guideline.
"There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They are stalled, beaten and killed because of the color of their crops, "said NAACP chairman Rod Chapel of Missouri City Star.
"We hear complaints in the meantime that we have not heard before."
The association issues such a warning for the first time in a US state.
The group exemplified the racial insults against the black students at the University of Missouri and the deaths of Tory Sanders, a black man in Tennessee.
At the beginning of this year, Sanders was taken into custody before being charged with a crime by the Missouri police when he passed through the state and died under suspicious circumstances.
The advisory note also highlights a new report by the Missouri Attorney General's office that shows that the black drivers in the state are more likely to be stopped by 75 percent than whites.
"The advisory declaration is for people to be alert and to warn their families, friends and colleagues that they might be in Missouri," Chapel said.
"If people bring bail with them, they have to be ready to let their relatives know what they will pass through this province."
In Missouri, according to the FBI's latest hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015, ranking 16th in the country in terms of the number of state violations.
Travel alert is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it more difficult for a workplace to sue for discrimination while renting or giving a job.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona, after local provincial executive authorities passed the immigrant enforcement laws, which ordered people to be arrested for immigration violations, the ACLU says, which would increase practices against the IRCA.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Office to other countries, but recently defense groups have resorted to this practice in response to a number of laws and trends within the United States.
Beşiktaş'da Demba Ba okay
Demba Ba, who had been transferred to China Shenhua for 13 million euros in the previous season and leased to Black & White last season, is returning to Beşiktaş free of charge.
The Black Eagle, who requested a detailed medical report from Senegalese player last week, took action after the report from star football.
The black-and-white administration, who started working for the 32-year-old player, who the Chinese representative did not consider in the squad next season, stole the Shanghai team's door.
Not written to the list
Demba Ba, who is not on the list due to his status as a foreigner in China, told the governor that he wanted to return to Black and White.
The Chinese team has approved the release of the 32-year-old player.
Senegalese futbolcunun come to Turkey in the coming days, is expected to sign the official contract.
Castillo was operated on Trabzonspor
In the statement on the web site of Bordeaux-blue club, Castillo had an arthroscopic meniscus operation in his left knee at Liv Liv Hospital and he stated, "After the operation performed by Prof. Dr. Uğur Haklar, it is foreseen for the team to start the training with the team within 4 weeks".
Castillo was injured in the right back athlete in a friendly match against Dutch team Heerenveen at the Slovakia camp of the burgundy-blue team.
It was decided that the Colombian player who was told to stay away from the sahara for 3-4 weeks due to the treatment had to undergo surgery due to the meniscus problem he had experienced before.
A referendum out of Barzan!
Barzani made a speech at the commemoration ceremony held in Duhok city due to the 3rd anniversary of the attack of the terrorist organization DEAS to Ezidil in the Sincar district of Mosul.
Talking about the independence referendum IKBY wants to organize on 25 September, Barzani said: "I have to regret it, we have no hope that Iraq will be a right and proper country."
We tried all the ways with Iraq, but we were completely desperate and desperate.
Past experiences with Iraq have brought us into this situation and there is no guarantee that we will be able to receive and protect our rights.
That is why we need to show that we can appoint our fate to the whole world through a referendum so that life and safety can be ensured together.
I should not underestimate this, the referendum is not a goal for us, but a tool for reaching the bigger goal.
Barzani reminded that the Iraqi central government has made many promises to the Kurdish after 2003, when the Baathist regime collapsed, saying that the disaster in Sincar has not come too soon and that a direct referendum decision has been taken after the fight with DEAŞ.
Barzani expressed that the people of IKBY want to determine their destiny in a peaceful and democratic manner for their self-preservation and development. "Belgela emerged that Iraq does not protect or protect us like a state."
"We do not want our progress".
In response to the terrorist organization DEAŞ, Barzani reacted to the fact that the central government of Iraq did not give them arms, but Hashdi Shabi, who was established with a fatwa in a short time, was immediately legalized and supplied all the weapons.
In the defense system of Iraq, Peshmerge was not addressed.
The central government did not make Pashmerge whom he offered to Hasidi Shabi.
The Peshmerga, according to the Constitution, is regarded as part of Iraq's defense system.
However, while there was no constitutional entity in Hasadi Shabi, all the possibilities were mobilized by breaking the laws.
We do not say we are against Hashed Shabi.
Peshmerga and Hazi Shabi fought on the same front, and why is Hazz Shabi legalized on the one hand, Peshmergen's existence and the struggle against terror are covered up.
These are our deep wounds with our Baghdad.
The terrorist organization DEAŞ attacked Ezidil, who lived in the Sincar district of Mosul on 3 August 2014, and killed many people, including women and children.
Turned away with 10 minutes
According to the BBC, Boeing 777 passenger plane belonging to Air France airlines was in the western part of Hokkaido in northern Japan while North Korea's fleet airs.
Noting that the fuze fell to the area where the plane was 10 minutes ago, officials noted that the fuze was estimated to approach the plane 100-150 kilometers.
In the statement made by Air France, it was noted that the fuse did not intersect with the flight and that there was no problem with the flight in question.
"The information we have available at this stage shows that the fuze falls into the sea more than 100 kilometers away from the flight of the plane."
Is not nothing sacred?
Trump's White House now targets Freedom Sculpture
The most obvious sign of the regime change is to start attacking the sculptures.
The Americans are as tall as any of them, as Saddam Hussein, who is carefully crafted, is overthrown in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 ...
Stephen Miller, one of the key theorists of the Trump regime, knew exactly what he was doing with CNN's Jim Acosta and the president in a heated debate about the rigid restrictions on legal immigration and the destruction of the Statue of Liberty symbolically.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, he would have a full boat tour and the Freedom Imitator would lynch him.
But he attacked his meaning, and in particular the attribution to him after being added to the base of Emma Lazarus' famous poem monument 17 years after the monument itself was completed in 1903.
As Miller said to Acosta: "I do not want to talk history from beginning to end here, but the Statue of Liberty ... is the symbol of light for the world of American freedom.
The poem you mentioned is added later and is not part of the original Freedom Sculpture. "
Miller is right in reality, but as he says, this is not really about history.
This seems to be about the contemporary reverberation of Lazarus' terrifying words, only a state in them invites not only some elderly immigrants but also the poor too: "exhausted, poor, exhausted, exhausted, desperate for freedom.
There has never been a time when our "shabby unwanted" screens are so visible.
Miller did not make a literary criticism, and he explained that these people were not welcome in Trump's USA.
The clash about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is actually a clash about the American way.
Lazarus and his friends who campaigned to put his words at the base of the sculpture after his death knew very well that they had made a very political act.
The sculpture intends to celebrate the connections between French and American republicanism with a stereotypical movement by representing Freedom as a woman's body.
Lazarus changed that maniac: the woman's figure in his poem was no longer abstract, he had a voice.
And she gives her a very different name: Mother of the Exiled.
The marriage with the image of poetry is a gentle feminist coup and a devastating assault on the American immigrant opposition.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers wanted to change it back for a long time.
For Trump's arrival, the big boss, Rush Limbaugh, who is a Baptist John-style man, argued that Freedom in 2010 did not invite anyone in, but it was an early-age neocontine that kept more American fire in the dark world: "Miss Freedom is on the way.
He exists to move the freedom torch from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not what illuminates the road to the United States. "
In an unusual way, Limbaugh actually discovered something.
The meaning of the statue was completely related to the perception angle.
The magnificent creative action of Lazarus was to see it as seen after long, often miserable journeys by exhausted, shabby but hopeful people on decks of the ships.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking shelter and wanting to improve their lives.
His sculpture was responding to them with the words of hope and warm greetings they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not a perspective that Miller and Trump would justify in any way.
Their torch is not to show their way, but to exaggerate the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scottish men could enter Great Britain
Neil Black, the UK athletic performance director, says a 16-member Scottish team from the World Championship team will provide "a huge enthusiasm".
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something is developing" in Scotland and that the UK athlete should learn from it.
"We embrace it, and we're trying to figure it out," Black said, "and we will try until we get out of it."
"I talk to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it's about what they do.
Scottish Athletics thinks it's about what they did.
British athletic: He thinks it's about what they do.
So is the guy on the corner at the corner.
Whatever the combination of conditions is, it's absolutely fantastic. "
Laura Muir and many Scottish athletes, including Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah at 5000 m, are competing for the medal, while Eilidh Doyle is chosen by the squad as captain.
"Eilidh is a little humble.
The captain's talk was unbelievable, "says Black.
"Whether they are Scottish or wherever they live or work, a few athletes have become very proud and really motivated by it.
Eilidh's natural passion and genuine feeling was magnificent. "
The silver medalist from the League of Nations, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at his fifth World Championship, is "incredible" to have 16 Scottish teams on the British team.
The best total athlete in Scotland's previous world championship was the one that was achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Last year five British and two European record-breaking middle distance coaches Muir leader.
1500 m and 5000 m will participate.
Chris O'Hare ran at 1500 m, a very good season, including British team trials and triumphs at the Annual Games, another Scottish to watch.
Doyle remembers his first championship with Lee McConnell, the only other Scottish in the team.
The team captain says he is "very proud" as many of his compatriots will not only get in trouble, but in some cases they will compete for the medals and stay in the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that it was given by the other members of the team, so it was already a great honor, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you made it extra special for me," he added.
"Obviously, I am proud of all the Scottishes who are wearing it.
This shows us how far we've traveled.
And they, as proven athletes, come here as athletes to watch the podium.
As for the captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I take advantage of the fact that we are very lucky in this situation, in that there is a World Championship in our home.
I mean, in reality this is the only effect of taking advantage of this in-home support and we have succeeded in returning to the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to get there and fight, and there will be such a great atmosphere. "
Block critics on Facebook: If you can not remove criticism from voters
The father of our country had some information about getting negative.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for the newspapers to criticize him critically about everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course it was uncomfortable with the criticism.
But the critics did not stop him.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be lifted from the dead, and we can be dragged into silence and silence."
It brings me to Maryland governor Larry Hogan, who should work harder to become like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and shared the sharing of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
Valinin's staff did not care because the case was unfounded, and online comments were filled with "who cares?"
Many said, "It's just Facebook."
But this is important.
This is especially important when someone is like Hogan.
It is a Republican governor who is overwhelmingly popular in a predominantly Democratic state.
The country has the second highest approval rate among the 50 governors.
The hogan is not a reactionary madman.
He was a leader in his province and mastered solid commitment to the principles.
He was also very good at using Facebook as his primary tool to connect with his electorate, presenting his hairless head after chemotherapy jokes.
It is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people who come to the page of the governor, who is a public forum, officially governed by members of the staff who are paid tax dollars to the people.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's female spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended Valin's actions, arguing that it was no more than blocking them to organize them.
But it's easy to use images of online spam attacks by trollers or spammers or hateful people.
The Post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people who speak only to their elected leaders: a teacher, a workplace proprietor and a priest, not a trawler.
They all said that their comments were not respectful, thoughtful and abusive.
The chaplain quoted from the Bible, addressing Hogan's Catholic faith in sharing.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Maryland Bowie was not hateful, but questioned about hate crimes.
"I gently commented that I was disappointed that he was unresponsive to his hate crimes and other recent news," wrote The Post's commentary.
"I also do not like the idea that when many people comment on the same subject, some come from a large group of worried citizens rather than as a so-called collective effort."
Others who Valin's staff calls the "intensified spam attack" will probably call it "advocacy of ideas".
It facilitates the easy adaptation of a message via the Facebook period, the blocking of an opponent or the deletion of a negative message.
It is far cleaner than the old days when the staff should be sent out to collect and burn newspapers with critical writings, or arrest and silence the protesters.
But if it's digital, it's exactly what happens.
Hogan is not the first public service to be criticized for disabling Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is court-martialed by Twitter users who are blocked on the Twitter stream.
One of the future decisions on this issue came from Virginia last week.
According to James C. Cacheris, US District Judge in Alexandria, the presidency of the Supervisory Board of the Loudoun Administration District violates the First Amendment of the Constitution when it bans an election on Facebook.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (Republican) was visited by the ACLU because of the use of Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be that hard.
In Washington time, the reasonably priced mail transfer had a similar effect to that of the Internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers came in fourth, and unknown letter writers abused his leadership.
Even then, Washington had unknown trolls.
People who use aliases such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers that kept Washington's decisions under control.
According to the online George Washington Productions Project, which collects historical documents, the Office of Petitions criticized the stance of the Friendship, Trade and Navigation Agreement with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Expression, freedom of opposition and retaliation are at the very core of our nation.
Real leadership also means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to be at home in the Renaissance Club
Ronan Rafferty hopes that in the next three days the Renaissance Club in South Lothian will be at home in the comfort of home to the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Before losing to Paul Eales at Archerfield Links, the Northern Irishman, who led the next door by winning the lead, feels loyal to the new venue and acts as the embassy of the tournament founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the construction of the Renaissance Club and I see that you have a glimpse with this organization," Rafferty said.
The players will see the field in the best condition, in a fantastic situation.
Jerry set up this place and did a great job.
He is a tireless advocate of this game and is proud of his success there.
This is a great demonstration for this field. "
Despite winning both the Europen Tour and the European Challenge Tour, the British Eales will have a championship defense battle for the first time in their 32-year career.
The Southport-based player said, "It really feels special."
"I did not have a chance to protect Extremadura Open because it was removed from the next calendar year.
It's nice to go back to this part of the world.
Great place to play golf.
Last year memories are reviving and it was very important for me to win my wife Sharon last year.
It was a special time and we were always in love. "
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after he entered the age of 50 at the beginning of this year, is also returning to the game on his own.
This organization will be the first Scotland event since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"When you fight inside, it always means a little more," Helensburgh man Orr said.
"You want to make it good, but you also feel extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing it again and played a lot of golf.
I am happy to go so far. "
The trio participated in this trio, former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six scots on the scene, with Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation is free and there is a car park, £ 5 per car and £ 10 per car with two or more people.
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
I found the answer
Considering an "armchair" ... The budget consists of 6 billion 867 million Turkish Liras and more than a budget of each of the ten ministries including Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science and Technology, Environment and Urbanism, Health, Culture and Tourism ministries.
Number of personnel is 117 thousand 378.
Turkey's largest "propaganda base"!
Yes, I'm talking about the Directorate of Religious Affairs!
Yes, I will talk about the Director of Religious Affairs Mehmet Görmez!
Days ... I am looking for answers to my question in my head ...
I wonder what the real reason why Mehmet Görmez was taken from his seat ...
I have read every article about his submission.
None.
I can not find the answer to the question I'm looking for.
Even earlier this year ...
Mehmet Görmez has prepared the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan of the Presidency of Religious Affairs (DİB).
President Erdogan under the 1 million pounds S 600 model was pulled Mercedes.
So there was no problem with Erdogan.
What happened?
You can say, "Is not enough for seven years in office?"
First Deputy Chairman M. Rifat Börekçi served for 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz, whom you all know, sat on that arm for 11 years.
I mean ... the president's mandate is open.
I turn back to responsibility again: Why did Mehmet Görmez leave his seat?
Business fell down ...
Shia closeness
Ruling close source said: - "According to the traditional Ulama, Mehmet Dönmez did not have the sultan's sünnete!"
The code of this clemen is shudder: Sunnism did not come out!
The person who wrote this sentence went behind: - "Modernist by traditional ulema!"
So, Mehmet Görmez seemed innovative.
What does innovation mean?
The answer to the question was hidden on Mehmet Görmez's trip abroad.
Date: December 27, 2015.
Mehmet Görmez went to Iran to attend the 29th Wahdat Conference in Tehran, aimed at bringing closer Islamic sects.
Religious leader of Iran met Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Shi'i kept praying with his clergy.
And Conferance said: "The sects are human institutions that have formed over time, representing different ideas and convictions in the understanding of Islamic religion".
The purpose of all is to determine the direction to Allah.
Each one is on the way to the main road, but the place to get there is the same.
It is unacceptable to distinguish sects from religions or to see sectarian affiliation above the Islamic religion.
Discipline based on sectarian, ethnocentric and conflict is a reflection of intransigence and ignorance.
In the cases where the sects are in front of the religion, the religion which is the most damaged has become itself ...
I want to emphasize again by highlighting here:
The Shiites and the Sunnis are a single umma ...
"No one can denounce another because he does not perceive Islam as he understands" ...
A year later ...
Only the Caferi leader Selahattin Özgündüz from Turkey participated in the 30th Wahdat meeting.
I mean ...
Not Sunni but Wahhabik
The speech made by Mehmet Görmez to Iran and the conference made him the target of "traditional julean".
The next Tehran conference represented the Turkish State - again - no one to attend.
In fact, Mehmet Görmez had not been invited four times since he came to see religion.
The reason was certain: the anti-Shiite-Iranian "traditional ulema" in the DİB!
Immediately after the Iranian tour, the seat of Mehmet Görmez began to be worn from the beginning of 2016.
At the beginning of this, the Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş was in charge of the DİB!
Mehmet Görmez was so drowned that he wanted "to be attached to the Presidential Office of the DİB".
In essence ...
There was a difference in the state's view of Sunnism.
Some of the "traditional ulema" formed in the theoretical worlds of Saudi Arabia and Egyptian media were identified with Sunni - Wahabi-Salafism in the shadow of the USA!
These were opponents of Iran who had no tolerance even on a trip to Tehran.
The words of Rob Ahmet about Mehmet Görmez were not surprising: "The Diyanet did not come from danger."
"My Lord, the nation is bound to the nationality and the faithful of the People of the City is a faithful leader ..."
They used "hall of loyalty" as a symbolic concept of Iranian hostility.
For a time, anti-Iran-anti-CIA support by FETÖ was now under new leadership.
Besides, with the FETO corpses ...
The photograph of a genus with whiskey in his hand was served to the media with the lie "Mehmet Görmez's son"!
Oh what a coincidence!
Who made Mehmet Görmez the biggest opposition in the media: The journal of the Lighthouse Community in Turkey is Turkey!
After all ...
- who resisted bringing Sunni into the line of the Suudi Wahabi-Salafi ...
- Who does not ignore the sectarian divide ...
- Modernist ... A clergyman, his consciousness was destroyed by the "traditional ulema" created during the Cold War ...
US culture imperialism continues to rapidly Turkey (Wahhabi-Selefi) to Arabization.
Do not doubt that the future Director of Religious Affairs will be the Wahhabi-Salafi representative!
"We support Turkey's sovereignty"
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu went to China to visit official.
Çavuşoğlu and Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi held a joint press conference at the State Guest House in the capital Beijing.
"We hope that Turkey will participate more actively in international affairs."
China will support Turkey in its efforts to preserve sovereignty, stability and security.
"We hope that the Palestinian issue will be resolved with the international community, including Turkey," he said.
Regarding the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Çavuşoğlu said, "Turkey is in search of a close working relationship with regional and international organizations, and international organizations are complementary, not an alternative to each other."
Spiritually officially begins the second period
The presidency of Hasan Ruhani, who won the presidential elections in May in Iran, was approved by the leader of the country, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Hasan Ruhani, who was elected president for the second time in Iran, took an oath in the ceremony attended by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the religious leader of the country.
Rıza Hakan Tekin, Turkey's Ambassador to Turkey, participated in the ceremony, attended by top military and political figures as well as foreign representatives.
The four-year-old president, who will serve as president, will officially begin the referendum after a swearing-in ceremony on Saturday (August 5th).
The ceremony is expected to be attended by Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekçi, representing Turkey.
Security measures at Cilvegözü Border Gate
Passing trucks carrying material other than humanitarian aid, food, medicine, cleaning materials from Cilvegözü Border Gate in Hatay's Reyhanlı district will not be allowed.
Accepted, according to the information, Babel Air Border Gate near the border with Turkey and due to the negative security conditions in the region Cilvegözü Border Gate, humanitarian aid, food, medicines and cleaning materials outside the transfer was closed.
Cilvegözü Border Gate allowances are also allowed at the exit.
There was no information on how long the restriction would last.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Land of Indonesia
Bardina Degei does not use a cooker while cooking.
He rarely even uses a container.
The housewife is putting a sweet potato, usually locally known as a "note", directly in the fire at the wooden house in Enarotali in Paniai nappe, in Papua, the restless region of Indonesia.
After half an hour, the roasted tuber was taken and wiped off with appetite, the hands were not washed.
Degei sits on a muddy floor, doing some choreography like washing clothes with the blurred water coming from the nearby swamp, no furniture.
A bucket in the house without a roof serves as a sahara helicopter.
As the youngest of four husbands of her husband, no field work has been assigned to her.
The polygamy is common here.
Of course working late hours can be dangerous: most of the men in the neighborhood are unemployed and most of them are drunk, and there are soldiers.
"Nobody walks in the village after 5 pm"
An uncommon moment of everyday life in the mountainous regions of Papua, a former Dutch colony absented by Indonesia in 1969, after a controversial referendum in which only 1026 elderly were forced to vote by forcefully voting before the troops invaded.
A current movement to propagate independence against the Dutch administration quickly turned its attention to the government of Jakarta, which banned foreign journalists or rights watchdogs, which kept tight control over the region.
In 2003, the region was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, where independent Papua New Guinea would occupy the eastern part of the island.
The Enarotali is as deserted as it is remote, the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the regional capital Jayapura to Nabire and a 5-hour car rushing in the stomach with a rental car.
No public transport.
The town of 19,000 people has wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, transformed into various yellowish brown tones by the rusted iron roof rust.
Leave the journalists, very few Indonesians have traveled here and almost no foreigners have traveled here.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, he worshiped Mee Pago Papuan, a god named Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We were not accustomed to wearing these clothes," says Degei, referring to the vibrant, hand-woven yellow, dark shirt and shiny hem.
"We used to wear leaves just before our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest region, with 28% of people living below the poverty line and the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But at the same time, this is the gold of Indonesia.
Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a mountainous region in New Jersey, home to 153,000 people.
Only in 2015 Freeport was about $ 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $ 78 billion timber reserves.
However, these wealth, which is a source of misery for the Papists, allows the powerful army of Indonesia to be a stifling entity.
The New York Times survey in 2005 reported that Freeport paid about $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 for local military personnel and units, including a sum of $ 150,000 for a single officer.
Papuan's call for more autonomy threatens this golden laying hen and comes from the merciless.
According to the rights advocates, more than 500,000 Papists have been killed by the Indonesian army since 1969, and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
Mass massacres in Papua's mountainous areas in the 1970s reached genocide figures according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
The Indonesian police just arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators in the region last year.
The Archbishopric of Brisbane's "We'll Lose Everything" report in 2016 includes the testimony of the grievances of the previous year, unlawful executions, torture (especially according to another report, rape and elections are particularly popular) and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are incidents every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher of Human Rights Watch.
Pressures have been increased since Papua's resources have brought settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million people in the region is 83% Christian, but the demographics are changing as Muslim immigrants from Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi come to economic purposes.
The javanese warung buffets sell gado-gado served with peanut sauce mixed with fried chicken and vegetables.
Local people are having difficulty competing.
"Immigrants sell chicken and vegetables at cheaper prices than local Papuan in traditional markets," explains Abeth You, 24, a native of Paniai, who moved to the regional capital Jayapura for business.
"This has caused the domestic Papists to lose the pop-up food (women) market."
Indonesian president Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, pledged to resolve the inequalities and violations of rights in Papua in his 2014 election campaign.
While the old carpenter was heading towards Jakarta's presidential palace, 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Panaia, took the game.
But little has changed in Papua and today local people feel cheated.
"We have broken hearts because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that we will realize the hope that justice will be restored."
In fact, Paniai suffered the worst of the situation only two months after Jokowi started referencing during October.
On December 7th, 2014, a group of 11 children broke two Indonesian military dances on motorcycles while singing Christmas songs in front of a bonfire in Enarotali.
The afraid children told them they should open their headlights.
One of the soldiers resented his style, and according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, he returned with four soldiers.
The victims and eyewitnesses said that the alcoholic soldiers chased the group and beat the rifles with their buttocks.
Then one of the soldiers fired at the boy band.
One of the children, Yulianus Yeimo, 16, was beaten so badly that he entered the coma.
A few hours later the nearby government election commissioner was set on fire and the next day the events climbed.
Up to 1,000 Papuan men, women and children were gathered to demand justice on a football ground in front of the local police headquarters and military command center.
They were carrying ritual hunting springs and waita dance dolls of Papua's Mee Pago tribe (running in ring form and mimicking birdsong).
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police and military garrison.
When the nerves were getting worse, orders were sent to the soldiers via internal radio: "If the crowd shows resistance from three times, shoot them and kill them." This was an official document seen by TIME that was not disclosed to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the approaching danger and demanded calmness by calling on the crowd to come home.
Nobody intended to listen.
"I was shot from my left wrist when I returned my back," he told TIME in a wooden house painted in bright colors.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says that the bullet has come in a gathered military erate
"The crowd was fired many times," he adds.
According to the cousin who was witness to the attack, the native Alfus Youw was shot three times.
Like many Indonesians, Yohanes, known for only one name, "I ran to him and studied his body to make sure he was there," he pessimed TIME.
"I saw you killed ... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers "only secured" the police station, because the police station was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Pudjo Sulistio, branch manager of the Papua Police spokesman, in 2015.
"It's about death and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were wounded.
The news of your deaths reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi made an enthusiastic speech at Jayapura, stating that he shared the suffering of the victims' families and that he would solve the historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that you are not in the future."
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he established a non-judicial mechanism for historical human rights violations.
But the rumors started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some are in the 90s and some are in the early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to resolving these violations, but there are processes that we have to go through. "
Speaking to TIME on June 5, Wiranto stepped back, saying there was no plan to set up a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "They will all be solved by law."
B.M., accused of "crimes against humanity" related to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, have already been resolved.
Families of the Paniai victims face such assertions with bitter skepticism.
"I've been interviewed four times in the past three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
Years later he says he's still living in fear.
"I'm scared."
"I am afraid of being arrested by a soldier, I am afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeats the view that the people in Paniai are afraid of discussing the matter.
He said he was beaten by the soldier after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After we buried the nations, the soldier came looking for me," he says.
The attacks have not stopped yet.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired at the peasants in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai navy.
During the clash between the villagers and the director of a construction company refusing to help a man who was not on his way to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others, including children, were injured.
Ravianus Douw, 24, drowning in a nearby lake while fishing, died while going to the hospital.
They protested in front of the construction site office of the angry peasant company.
Police said the villagers were throwing stones at civil servants and they reacted by making a warning shot.
But the locals say the moving brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) fired at the crowd and killed someone.
Dominggu Badii, a 29-year-old woman who lives close to the hospital and witnesses the wounded, tells TIME: "We panicked, we were afraid we would get revenge."
"I am hiding in my house two days."
The Deiyai parliament called on the officers involved to take responsibility and to withdraw the moving police brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a problematic region for the Indonesian government.
Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who lived scattered throughout the green mountainous center of Papua, lack the significant development of the tribe's nostalgia.
Many joined the rebellious army Free Pope Movement (OPM), claiming that the Papuanis were guarding their rights by random attacks and by raiding Indonesian soldiers.
Some senior OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, come from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and held arbitrarily by the military in recent years under the "national sovereignty" pact.
Some are never seen again.
Among the peoples of Papua, Paniai is known as a "tragic and forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
The little rice that is on sale at Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is unattainable.
The people here grow up everything they eat: mainly musical notations, as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of women who can handle four or five field sweet potatoes.
Generally, most of the harvest is kept for the family, they sell the rest on the local market.
10 notes are only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, since the opening of new air routes to the domestic Papuan and Nabire Airport, the economic disparities between the new arrivals have grown.
Things that are already low go to immigrants who are generally better educated and richer.
Capes or their required qualifications are very seldom used by Papuanas to run their businesses competitively.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no job or money here," says John Gobai, president of Panai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
Furthermore, the limits of journalism for the international media remain firm.
At the beginning of the year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were rarely deported from Papua because of "lack of coordination with the relevant institutions", despite the fact that they were allowed to take video footage.
According to Pahlim Kine, Deputy Director of Asia for Human Rights Watch Asia, Jokowi's promises of lifting the limits of news and making progress were not made to increase the election campaign transparency.
In one statement he said: "There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Papua and Western Papua, the restless eastern provinces of Indonesia: visa denial and black list."
The lack of a press inspection means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is mostly limited to its immediate neighbors near Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) encouraged the B.M. Human Rights Council to investigate "various and common violations" in Papua, including attacks on Panaia.
The same countries historically support the OPM.
Arrmanatha Nasir, Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman, told journalists in Jakarta that "the democratic system in Indonesia is still valid and there is free media, so it is hard for the evidence on human rights cases to be covered."
Local people want more foreign governments to take care of it.
When a Dutch official delegation visited Jayapura on May 4 under the chairmanship of the country's human rights envoy, Kees Van Baar, the local people dismissed their silence as "we want freedom", according to a source who participated in the meeting and did not want the name to be disclosed.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papists say it is unlikely they will ever vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai attack," says Tribal Council president Gobai.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai are rolling in poor health, with little education and health services, except for living under the approaching threat of the tyrant.
Gobai says that like other Papuanis, the Paniai people also see their people as a "debt" to pay back to Jokowi.
"They do not need the money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack carried out a final symbolic counter-action: burying a victim's body in the face of the police and army outpost.
Knowing that justice can never be fulfilled, at least they will ensure that those responsible do not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was murdered," says Yacobus, head to head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire shuts Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for the second time
A fire on Friday in Dubai frustrated the world's highest inhabitants and forced hundreds of residents to escape from the 337-meter-long 79-story building.
This is the second big fire spreading rapidly to a high building called Torch Tower in two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and no explanation was given about the cause of the major fire.
"We were asleep and woke up to the fire alarm, people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs and walked around for 10 minutes until we reached the 50th cattan. "That's how he talked to a quiet Reuters who gave his name as George.
Dubai's civil defense authorities said the fire brigade had turned the big fire around 4:00 am GMT on the local time and was cooling the building.
The government explained that they were trying to build shelter for the affected people.
This could bring back questions about the safety of material used in the outer parts of high buildings around the world.
The investigation conducted by the Torch management after the fire in 2015 found that the majority of the damage was in the outer panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the UK, the police said they believe London's isolation and veneer panel system on the Grenfell Tower, where 80 people were killed, might have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire.
More than 4 chronic patients 'social welfare'
Family and Social Policies The Ministry of Health will benefit from 4,300 tuberculosis patients and SSPE patients in the first stage of the social assistance program for the citizens and their families who are struggling with chronic diseases.
The Ministry plans to provide monthly support for more than two thirds of the patient's minimum wage with the help program, which will also provide regular psychosocial support.
According to the information received, the details and implementation principles of the "New Social Aid Program for Fighting Chronic Diseases", which started working recently with the instruction of Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, Minister of Family and Social Policy, became clear.
The social welfare program launched in order to support citizens who are struggling with chronic diseases in the business union with the Ministry of Health and who have economic and psychological difficulties is a first in the world in many respects.
Having completed all preparations for the start of the program, the Ministry will provide regular psychosocial support to the families not only in cash but also in the social assistance program.
In this way, it is aimed that the poor citizens who have chronic illnesses and continue the treatment processes at home and their families are not left alone both materially and spiritually.
According to the work done, in the first stage, poor people struggling with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a brain disease caused by tuberculosis disease and measles microblogging, will receive regular psychosocial and financial support under the new social assistance program.
In the course of the program, the poor citizens who struggle with other rare and risky diseases will be included in the aid program.
In addition to the planned support for two thirds of the minimum wage, additional payments may also be made to tuberculosis patients who are unable to clear their medical self-care, who are dependent on bed, or whose home-living conditions need to be improved.
In order to benefit from the support, it is required that the monthly income per capita be less than two-thirds of the monthly net minimum wage.
In addition, citizens with SSPE should have a health board report prepared in accordance with the procedures and principles specified in the "Regulation on the Disability Criterion, Classification and Disability Health Board Reports".
According to the survey, more than 1 in 5 US passengers bring banned materials to the plane
According to a survey conducted by airline passengers, more than 20 percent, including at least 6 percent, knowingly or unknowingly missed banned materials from the US Transportation Security Administration's control points, without knowing that they carry prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Less than 1 per cent claimed that he realized he had traveled accidentally with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
More than 1000 people surveyed by Stratos Jet Charters jet rental service found that younger travelers were more likely to cheat on their rules.
Of the participants who admitted to trying to fly knowingly with something prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent are members of the Y generation, while 15 percent are members of the X generation.
The most common substances that are deliberately missed by TSA agents are food and liquids.
While more than 3 per cent confidently know that there are sharp tools for safety, 2.2 per cent of female participants and 3,7 per cent of male respondents also know that they are deliberately carrying banned drugs.
The company said it conducted questionnaires around the country to find out how many people mistakenly brought illegal goods to the airport and what they did knowingly do.
It is not a surprise that the most likely people who knowingly or unknowingly pass illegal goods through security are the ones who fly the most.
Nevertheless, as the company noted, the TSA rules are a bit tricky and confusing.
People are often unsure about what liquids or how much they can carry.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of material confiscated by the TSA appears as banned liquids.
For a while, people thought that the TSA might be treating books as illegal goods.
Liquor is allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights.
China welcomed US statements
At a press conference in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi voiced Tillerson's admonition to the Pyongyang administration, saying, "We are not in search of a regime change, the regime's collapse, the swift reunification of the regime, and the sending of our troops north of the 38th parallel."
Chinese Foreign Minister Vang expressed that Tillerson reiterates the principles of the Washington administration's North Korea issue and hopes that the US will implement these principles effectively and in a concrete result-oriented policy.
Noting that the security of the Korean peninsula is a priority, Wang stressed that the parties had long expected to find a way to resolve their concerns through equal dialogue and that the Beijing administration had long insisted on the elimination of nuclear weapons from the peninsula, the preservation of peace and stability and the resolution of problems through dialogue and negotiation.
EPA President Pruitt Drops Obama Delayed Emission Reduction Laws
One day after being sued by the 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt reversed the previous decision to delay the implementation of Obama-based laws that reduce air pollutant emissions causing dirty water.
Pruitt represented the change, with its own organization being more sensitive to the needs of state environmental regulators than past governments.
He never mentioned a legal appeal against his previous position in a federal high court.
In the meantime, the provinces should begin to meet October 1, the deadline for 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt has announced that he will postpone alignment for one year in June to give his organization more time to work on the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or preventing economic growth".
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Oklahoma's provincial chief prosecutor, Pruitt, has long served as a trusted ally against stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has acted repeatedly to prevent or delay regulatory changes that chemical and fossil fuel industries have been facing.
The sudden change on Wednesday is the latest legal defeat for Pruitt's regaining agenda.
Last month, a federal high court in Washington ruled that the EPA's manager had to go beyond the limits of his authority to try to delay the practice demanding oil and gas companies, which are Obama administration law, to monitor and reduce methane exacerbations.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that the return to ozone standards would strengthen EPA's commitment to working only with the states in time for new standards and through complex processes.
"Under previous governments, EPA often fails to meet the deadlines of decisions, waits to be sued by activist groups and others, and agrees to resolve the dispute to set timelines for the decision," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than once on his previous job.
"We do not believe in ordering through litigation and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also receive the law and the authority it gives us. "
Nevertheless, the EPA's statement stated that Pruitt could once again use his "delay power and all other legally available power" in order to "ensure that regulations are" supported by sound policies and the best available information ".
Republicans in the Congress are pressuring for a wider rewrite of ozone laws.
A Parliamentary design approved last month is struggling to delay the implementation of the 2015 laws by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to the Senate for voting.
New York chief prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who led the state coalition that sought EPA this week, said his group intends to pursue legal overthrow.
Schneiderman said: "Following our response, EPA's decision-making is an important win for the health and safety of over 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the dirty water flowing into their communities."
Davada attended New York from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
When general pollutants are released by automobiles, power plants, petroleum refineries, chemical plants and other sources responding to sunlight in the atmosphere, ground-level ozone is brought to the waterfall.
The resulting dirty smoke can lead to serious breathing problems in a rapidly affected group of people, contributing to thousands of early deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applauded Pruitt's surprise decision change.
Lori Ann Burd, of the Center for Biological Diversity, said: "It's disturbing that the people in charge of protecting the air we breathe need so much pressure to get this discreet step."
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological struggle to cheat on environmental polluters and interest groups."
Inflation single digits
Turkey, which had the largest increase in exports in July, attracted 13.5 percent of the unemployment rate in January, and the economic confidence index peaked at the peak of 3.5 years, lowering the inflation rate to single digits.
According to the data released yesterday by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), the Consumer Price Index (TÜFE) rose 0.15 percent in July, while annual inflation fell to 9.9 percent for the first time since January.
In July, the highest increase in monthly spending was in restaurant and hotel groups with 1.75 percent, while the group with the highest decrease was clothing and footwear with 3.51 percent.
The highest increase in the annual basis was in the transport group with 15.24 percent.
"In July, inflation has remained at a single pace, parallel to the expectations," said Economist Muammar Kömürcüoğlu, "There is a decline in the prices of food and clothing groups in the moderate course of inflation."
However, core indicators have a rise compared to the previous month, unlike the headline.
"We do not expect a relaxation in the tight stance of the Central Bank," he said.
Despite the drop in headline inflation, the core inflation indicators showed an uptrend.
The B index, which is closely watched closely by the Central Bank, rose from 9.07% in July to 9.46% in July, from 9.20% to 9.60%.
"Inflation may fluctuate until December and fall to a single rate in December," said Kapital FX Research Assistant Manager Enver Erkan.
"The opportunity of the Central Bank to pass the first month of 2018," he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek: Inflation will close the year with a single dime.
The tightening of the Central Bank will continue until inflation falls below 7 percent.
We will finalize the reforms in the nearby Food Committee.
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci: We are pleased to see the drop in inflation's single-digit figure, but this should become permanent.
In addition to lowering the volatility of food prices in the fight against inflation, supply should be increased.
Development Minister Lütfi Elvan: In the coming months there may be some upside trend in annual inflation due to the base effect, but from the first months of 2018 the downward trend in inflation will become evident.
We estimate that annual inflation will go down even further.
I wish Fenerbahce will be successful in the next matches.
Sturm Graz coach Franco Foda said that their performance in the second half was not enough to take a lap in the UEFA Europa League 3rd qualifying round revenge match with Fenerbahçe 1-1.
Speaking at a press conference after the encounter, Foda said Fenerbahçe was a top-level team, saying, "We could not use the wings at the first half."
In the second half we got a balance.
We had the chance to score the second goal.
I am still proud of my team.
In the second half they changed the flow of the game.
We could have been a little better.
The little things in the match were deciding.
"I wish Fenerbahce will be successful in the next matches".
Foda stated that they feel very good as long as they are in Turkey and they are happy because of the hospitality they see.
Fernando in Istanbul
Brazilian footballer Fernando Francisco Reges, who started his transfer talks with Galatasaray Club, came to Istanbul.
The Brazilian footballer from Ataturk Airport welcomed the fans enthusiastically.
Fernando, whose yellow-red supporters showed love with cheers, left the airport by riding a private vehicle waiting for him under security precautions.
Starting his career in Brazil's Vila Nova team, Fernando, 30, wearing Estrella Amadora, Porto and Manchester City formals, is serving in the midfield.
The Brazilian footballer is expected to sign a contract with the yellow-red team after passing the health check.
Galatasaray, who is continuing his transfer studies, has signed an agreement with Manchester City for Fernando for 5,250,000 euros, which he tried to add to his long-term career.
Flash from the United States Rakka hamlesi: Internal Security Power ...
Colonel Dillon, who was linked to the United States Department of Defense (Pentagon) by video conferencing from Baghdad, said his Rakka Internal Security Force (RIGG), trained by the coalition, is beginning to settle in clean areas of the city from DEAŞ.
"The Rakkah Homeland Security Force, consisting mostly of Araplandans and local anti-DEA volunteers, in the clearing areas of the city, continues to maintain order and prevent terrorists from escaping or returning," Dillon said.
This week 230 people completed their education and attended the group, Dillon said, "for now the number of strength is 850".
Dillon stated that he was trained by the coalition on basic armament training as well as first aid, armed conflict, screening and checkpoint operations.
Rakka says that the intimacy of the Internal Security Force is very intense, Dillon noted, adding that the coalition will continue to screen applicants for education and employment.
The US-led coalition cooperates with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the main backbone of the PYD / PKK in the acquisition of Rakka.
The PYD / PKK terrorist organization has taken the PKK terrorist, Leyla Muhammad, as co-chair of the Rakka civilian management council.
It is claimed that there will be members of the PKK / PYD within the military power in Rakka.
Dillon also announced that the US-led coalition had gathered heavy weapons from an opposition group called Şüheda Karyateyn (Şuhuk) in the camp at El Tanif in the south of Syria, where he was supported last week.
"After seeing the leaders last week, Şuhuk brought the heavy weapons and equipment that the coalition gave them, but allowed some small arms and light vehicles to stay there," Dillon said.
The United States announced last week that it had patrolled out of conflicting territories that Russia had agreed with and that it was supported by Şuhuk with the reason that it was involved in activities not related to fighting with DEAŞ.
It is stated that the group wants to fight against the Besar Assad regime as well as DEAŞ.
According to leaked phone interview notes, Trump pressed Mexico on border wall payments.
Washington Post leaked notes of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on January 27, Trump squeezed him in not publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The US president scolded the Mexican president who held the ball publicly in the open, and he said, "You can not say this to the press."
Trump started his presidential campaign to build a wall along the southern border of the US and promised Mexico that he would pay the project.
The notes of the first meeting with Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, while a heated dialogue emerged.
Mr. Trump said that the agreement made by the Obama administration would make him look "fool" after Mr. Turnbull told the US that the deal with the US to get refugees to go to Australia is "ridiculous", "rotten" and "stupid" and offered a refugee placement ban to the US.
Mr Trump ended the conversation by saying to Mr. Turnbull, "This was the most unpleasant talk I ever made."
Patient's relatives broke the doctor's nose
The doctors and staff of the Turkish Higher Education Training and Research Hospital left a short period of work yesterday morning in order to react to the beating of friends of a doctor by their relatives.
The crowd gathered in front of the main entrance of the hospital with the foreign currency written "no violence in health" on their hands reacted to being alive.
Pediatric Cardiology Clinic Chief Prof. Dr. Feyza Ayşenur Paç, "The slogan" No violence in health "seems to me to be insufficient or even a side slogan.
In health, violence can not be the word.
"If they go this way, they will not find a health group that will soon be able to serve themselves," he said.
Ankara Provincial Health Director Dr. Kamil Türkmen, Ankara First Region Public Hospitals Secretary General Prof. Dr. Öner Odabaş, Turkish Higher Education Training and Research Hospital Chief Physician Prof. Dr. Mustafa Paç and their relatives in the hospital garden also supported the action of the health workers.
Paç condemning the incident, said:
Unfortunately, violence against health workers is increasing.
One example of this happened yesterday (the day before yesterday), when our cardiovascular surgeon was beaten by a patient relative.
Despite the fact that we have not taken the necessary precautions as our government, minister and governor to end these incidents as soon as possible, we demand that our people's sensitivity to this issue increase as well.
I condemn the events that happened yesterday on behalf of my patients and health workers.
Odabaş pointed out that the society needs to be conscious about violence in health, "Unfortunately, this has become a professional complication that we have experienced from time to time."
"We will also take our own measures, but most importantly, our national health care staff should own the" said.
Turkmen stated that the judicial process related to the incident had begun, "Our laws related to violence in health have appeared to be effective enough."
The levels of the state are applying it.
He's doing safety work right now.
In the past these have always been idle, but now it is a direct public case and the state has appointed a lawyer and is following the case.
"There are examples of heavy penalties taken against it".
After the announcements, the workers continued to work.
According to the claim, the incident occurred at 17:45 on the previous day.
Loss of his life in intensive care, his relatives attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Ozbek, who works in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, which reports death.
The police were called to the hospital while Uzbek was removed from the scene by doctors and assistants.
When the incident broke the nose of the Uzbek, the attackers were taken into custody.
A doctor from the witnesses of the incident said:
When our friend went to patient relatives to report the loss of his / her life, patient relatives attacked our friend and two friends in charge.
Our friend's nose was broken, it was in the blood.
Then we took our friend into the operating room and kept it.
I set the security for 15-20 minutes.
If his relatives had crossed that firewall, it would be much worse.

YPG loot in Syria ...
US intervened
According to AA's knowledge from local sources, YPG terrorists have plundered the homes of the residents of Tel Semin, in the northern countryside of Rakka, where US military support has entered with the reason of fighting terrorist organization DEAŞ.
The reaction of the civilians whose homes were plundered and confiscated turned into conflict with the terrorist organization.
On top of that, the US forces in the region entered the city with armored vehicles.
"Cougar MRAP" type armor, personnel carrier vehicles and Husky type mine detection tools were found to form the buffer zone at the site.
The terrorist organization YPG does not allow the civilians fleeing death from Rakka under fire under the anti-DEA operation to enter the cities in control.
The local activist network "Rakka silently slaughtered" announced yesterday that only 121 civilians had been killed in artillery fire in July.
Let's not move the old world's fights tomorrow
The delayed perception of the dormitory and world realities can lead to countries being dragged into crises as well as simple ones.
One of the reasons for the delayed perception of the realities of the world, which we regarded as "ephemeris", is that the reflections of these facts into the geographies of the East may be blocked by certain foci or announced in a more realistic way.
Don Quixote and Oblomov Delayed perception or perception of truth and change has become a subject of literature.
Cervantes' "Don Quixote" is a majzup that still thinks of himself as a knight, when the bourgeoisie begins to form.
Or Goncharov's "Oblomov" is a lazy religion that thinks that everything can be as old as when it comes to ignoring the facts.
The Chinese example For example, China is a country that is open to the world and dominated by the sea until the end of the 15th century, and the conquest of a conservative dynasty has finally come to an end.
This is the case until the captains of the boats out of China's land were executed.
We Turks, who have a foot, an eye and an ear in the West, another foot, an eye and an ear in the East, have experienced constant dilemmas in perceiving the facts and change starting from the Ottomans.
Old and new We have to go to a present day yesterday, try to understand today with the concepts that match the old conditions, tomorrow to think yesterday.
If we are an episode, we have been able to act as fast as the foci of thought in the developed countries to perceive the realities of the country and the world and change.
This situation has always been a source of conflict, tension.
Madrasa and university, janissary and modern army, confrontation with belief, caused a dramatic content dualism.
Progressiveness is also outdated It is even worse that new and advanced postures at one time were not accepted at the end of certain periods and will remain behind.
After a period of yesterday's campaigns, the new and advanced ones began to declare "Dangerous", while those who tried to interpret the conditions of the country and the world in accordance with the current truth started to declare "Traitors".
The most important lesson is that those who perceive the realities of the country and the world in the Ottoman Empire have to be dominant in thought and state life, the empire has finally dispersed, the collapse and the people have been impoverished.
The most important lesson that the Ottoman past sent to the Republic was the fact that the world conjuncture and the rapid perception of change were inevitable preconditions for survival.
Because this course is so well absorbed, we could be the example country of this geography that has been able to maintain its unity, integrity, stability in peace from the First World War to this day.
A different approach In order for us to be able to survive the global change process, we need to leave behind the memories and act in accordance with the facts.
In other words, it will not come to anyone who has carried away meaningless kamplaşmaları and blood cases which cause the demolition of our past in the past.
Moreover, the smallest mistakes in today's world are leading to very big and dramatic crises.
The most problematic geography in this regard is the Middle East we are in.

Turkish wind
The global giants who are confident of the future of Turkey have struggled to break the wind power plant yesterday.
The world record was broken by the model which the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources was designed to reduce external dependence and to make the transition to national energy.
A $ 1 billion investment and an approach to close to 4 jobs were opened with the tender that would cut Turkey's energy costs down.
By 2019 domestic production wind turbines will be included in the system.
Eight consortiums, including US, Chinese, German and Danish giants, participated in the renewable resource area (YEKA) wind power plant license contract opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.
In the meantime, first the financial proposal envelopes were opened to identify the 5 proposers with the lowest bid.
After the first bid envelope, the lowest bid was $ 4.19 / kWh.
The open auction interval was set at 0.01 cents.
After the tender started, Joint Venture groups in Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion, and Vestas took a decision not to participate in the open debate.
In open subtitles, Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed in groups.
MingYang-İlk İnşaat and Siemens-Türkerler-Kalyon were in the last two after the consortium where Nordex was taken.
MingYang-First Construction took 11 breaks.
The Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon Energy consortium has never used a break.
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak: Record day for Turkey.
Open auction lasted 30 laps.
The winner of the intense contest between the two consortia was the Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon joint venture group, which offered the lowest bid at $ 3.48 cents / kilovats.
While the consortium bidded $ 3.49 cents / kWh, the Deputy Undersecretary, Alparslan Bayraktar ordered the tender commission to take the offer to 3.48.
Turkey has achieved a world record with the result of the two-hour YEKA bid.
At $ 3.48 / cents per kilowatt-hour that is proposed, the world is the lowest number in this area.
The previous record was in the hands of Mexico at $ 3.84 / cents per kWh.
Berat Albayrak, the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources who organized the press conference after the conclusion of the tender, said that the winner of the competition by the German company Siemens is an important message to the region and the world. "I think that this result will make a significant contribution to Turkey-Germany relations when we look at Turkey and Germany in terms of 200 years of historical cooperation."
Our targets are big.
Today's outcome has revealed how firm and confident the economy and energy market is going to the future.
I have been very proud to announce that this tender has come to the fore at the beginning of the region and the most reliable countries in the world, no matter how many regional crises in the world.
"We will be proud of the whole Turkey, 80 million. In this picture, the biggest contribution is the President who carried Turkey to this point in 15 years of leadership and leadership."
"One of the most important steps of this is a world record price, with a historic record of $ 10.3 / cents per kilowatt-hour of domestic contribution to the wind until yesterday," said Albayrak, who stated that they have launched a new era with open, transparent and fierce competition.
I am proud of this, in the name of the nation, in the name of my country.
Minister Albayrak stated that they aimed to take the first domestic production panels in solar energy before the end of 2018 and said "I hope we will include our domestic production wind turbines in the system until 2019".
Turbines will be installed in 5 designated regions.
The winner of the contest will have a total installed power of one thousand megawatts, providing a wind power of at least 50 megawatts in each of these five regions.
The total investment of the Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon group will be over $ 1 billion.
With the introduction of domestic wind farms, a minimum of 3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity will be generated each year and approximately 1.1 million homes will be covered by the annual electricity demand.
Thanks to the wind facilities to be installed, an average of 1.5 million tons of CO2 / year emission reduction will be achieved.
The winner of the contest will build a factory with over $ 100 million in investment.
An average of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines will be produced on the plant, at least at 2.3 megawatts of power.
Consortium, wing, generator design, material technology and production techniques, software and innovative gearbox areas will be at least three out of five in the field for a total of 10 years of R & D work.
For R & D work, a budget of $ 5 million is allocated annually, while 50 technical personnel, 80 percent of which are domestic engineers, will work.
The factory will be installed 21 months after contract signing.
The license lasts for 30 years.
"We plan to finance the equipment from foreign sources and the remaining part from domestic banks," said Kazim Türker, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Turkerler Construction, who took part in the consortium that won the tender, saying that domestic production would be around 64 percent in the project and 35 percent of equipment would come from abroad.
Türker stated that the tender reflected the confidence in the Turkish economy.

Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reinvigorate Racist Lynch Event for Adalet Call
A 1948 model Ford Mercury was driven through a group of spectators in the Monroe Georgia countryside, and the small Ford Bridge in Moore was headed towards the tug of war.
The car, with four black passengers and a white driver, stepped forward to grab a group of white men before they reached the bridge.
A man in a middle-aged, thin-striped suit, the gang of the gang took a long breath from the lead pussy and looked carefully into the front window.
Inside, the occupants were frightened with fear.
"We want that, Roger!" The man barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
As a young black man was drifting through the front passenger seat, the screams pierced the darkness.
Fortunately, this horrifying scene on June 22 is just a revival.
But when a loop was thrown around the "Roger," everyone in the audience breathed a fairly realistic flair.
Since 2005, human rights defenders are returning to the Ford bridge in Moore to revive their lynching by two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) in 1946 by the Ku Klux Klan.
No one has ever been accused of murder.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the revival, said: "Even if we see them in our societies, we know who they are, they do not think that one person has been arrested for all these years."
"It's a stain on this date, but a burden on our souls."
Brooks was a 71-year-old former Georgia state convention member and a lifelong human rights advocate.
For him, this revival is a yearly reminder of a dramatic call for action and a remedy for justice in the Monroe community.
He said: "We want to prosecute, we want results, we want to hold the wounds, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice."
"We can not have it until it hugs the wounds and gains justice for reconciliation."
The forensic doctor put a bed sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Ford lincin on Moore on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding territories were suspected of lynching.
But even one of them was never investigated.
Although the suspects remain illegitimate for decades, human rights advocates say that the twin motivations of the lynch are always well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a high court ruling made it possible for black citizens in Georgia to vote in the preliminary election for the first time at the end of the summer.
At about the same time as the FBI, the black partner Roger Malcom blasted a white landowner, Barnett Hester, apparently about a woman during a fight.
Brooks stated that the gossip in the town was that Hester was lying with Dorothy, the wife of Malcom, and that the baby he was carrying was not his own husband.
According to the FBI, Loy Harrison, a leading white landowner on July 25, 1946, paid $ 600 to remove Malcom from prison.
Dorothy and her cousins went to jail in the presence of Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove away from the prison, a lynching gang flew around the car when they arrived at the Ford Bridge in Moore.
A FBI report says, "It seems like Harrison has ordered and ordered murders."
"It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between the state and local law enforcement agencies that they have not only been involved in the murder, destroyed the evidence, and hid the identities of the eyewitnesses."
Brooks talked briefly.
He said: "This was the right to vote."
"They were all killed to send a message to the black people in this society: 'If you register and vote, that's it for you.'"
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has been managing the revival of the Ford Bridge lynches in Moore every year.
His performance draws all the details, is remarkable and is based on a profound kind of racism that many believe he no longer exists in America.
Watching is difficult and even difficult to look at, but Greene says that's the goal.
He said: "We do not want to talk about Linc because all of us are confronted with the ugliness inside us."
"But if you are not listening to me or if you are not listening to what is coming, I can make a relationship with you."
The rehearsals for the production of this year began in June and the first day filled up with an actor close to 30 (a dozen white and black back) and when they entered the well-rehearsed general lines of Greene's play, they listened.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
For years, he played the role of President Klansman, but he says that his role has never been easier.
Marbaugh said: "I feel dirty because it's not me."
"But I think it's very important to keep this past alive because we do not want to go back then."
Throughout the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, were rehearsing their lines.
Malcom is shouting at Hester that his wife is so angry that he is sleeping with Dorothy and is pushing her to start the game.
"Z .... i said, get out of my property!"
Rascona is reacting.
There's a hitting sound.
And then everyone (at least black actors) is drowning in laughter.
Greene is laughing the most.
Rascona asked, "What ?!"
He was upset, surprised.
Is it too hard?
Greene said "No" in the gutters.
"I just do not think white people say that time ..."
One of the black players said "Yes" and threw mixed jokes.
"You should repress R."
So the energy in the room is changing and a kind of sincerity is taking its place.
Everyone is dedicated to doing it right, not just for the game's recollection, but for the memory of the four who were killed at the same time.
The scene starts again.
This time Rascona says the word that starts with N, sharp and accented.
Absolutely no one is smiling.
The resuscitation is ending violently and quickly.
There are screams, gun fire and then silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black stands on the actors' bodies and reads Billie Holiday's sadly minty "Weird Fruit".
The voice is broken in both words.
One hundred yards behind, an average of four dozen spectators sweep away sweat and tears from their eyes.
The tracker is almost evenly divided into black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York to see performance, many of them ahead of the road.
While Brooks took them on the holy journey into the cemeteries of the Malcom and Dorsey, they all rely on Georgia's repressive nourishment for almost eight hours.
Up to this point the murders remained as an anecdote, but standing in the same place as the lincin now means that the air is cursed.
While the last notes of the song are weakening, Greene invites the crowd to study the rapids and bodies.
The children crouch on their hands, falsify blood and motionless bodies, and whisper to each other.
A little boy murmurs as if he reminded himself, "They are not actually dead."
After a few moments, Greene thanks the crowd and ends up suddenly.
The actors are throwing lynch rope and wiping their tears.
Bradshaw is hugging Marbaugh in the suit that plays president Klansman.
Nick Rascona is hugging both of his players and their age in their arms, and the emotional performance of the performance finally comes to him.
One of the women whispered, "It's okay."
"We know it's not what's in your heart.
You did it for a while. "
Later, the audience is sitting at the actors with dinner.
The white couple from Atlanta on a desk is chatting fervently about reviving with a black couple.
Denise Duplinski has difficulty finding words about how her performance makes her feel.
He said: "These terrible, terrible words to hear and behaviors ... come out of people who look like you and they are doing them because they look like you."
"That's what you did to me, makes you think that your lynches are still going on," he added, "they are now called police-only attacks."
Tyrone Brooks on the edge of the oven is a focus of attention when he eats food and talks about human rights memories.
He said he was already planning his next year's performance.
He said: "A reanimation is inspiring because it describes what we are folded to, but at the same time it is a tutorial."
"If you do not learn from it, it looks like it might happen again.
Those who do not investigate their own past, those who do not know their past, are condemned to repeat it. "

In order to revive the business, Pearson 3000 made more of its work, cutting its profit margin
The British education group Pearson said Friday that he will start doing another 3000 restructuring and reduce the interim dividend by 72 percent while starting another restructuring program to come up from the top of the prints the business faces.
Chief executive John Fallon tells us that most of the cut-offs coming in late 2018 and early 2019 will be in addition to the 4,000 lost in the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to save 300 million pounds ($ 394 million) by attempting to rescue the rapidly shifting business of digital learning with a third cost-reduction program.
The company, which agreed to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said there was no change in the perspective of this year after it reported basic sales of £ 2.05 billion in the first half, up 1 percent.
Text 2 was taken to death again!
According to the first report of the Forensic Medicine Institute, according to Hakan "ın the first findings in the pre-autopsy report, death is suicide.
In the detailed review, no assault or allegation was found in the child's body.
The reason for suicide is that the elastic bandage around the neck is squeezed and the resultant breathlessness.
It was also determined that the cloth, which the family described as a bandage, was an elastic bandage used in the injuries.
According to the newspaper Habertürk's report on Muslim Sarıyar, after the child prepared a detailed report on the death, the report indicating that the incident was suicide was learned that the Büyükçekmece Public Prosecutor's Office, which conducts the investigation, will be sent.
While investigating the suicide of the child in full detail, the police are also examining the computer that is seized after the incident.
It is stated that the police will apply to the expression of Hakan "ın friends.
It is also stated that the information obtained from the Hakan "ın computer, which the relatives say is" Cleaned ", can be reached to third persons or a gang.
Police say Hakan may have dragged a suicide bomber.
Hakan's suicide is becoming certain, turning eyes into violent Metin2.
Metin2, who reacted to the fact that he caused addiction and violence in children, was banned from the ministry of Antalya last year by the province of Antalya last year, and came to the agenda by killing Metin Kang "ın, a tiny hacker who was 13 years old in 2009.
In order to play Metin2, which is designed in 2005, it is necessary to enter the site and register as a member.
The players try to maintain peace and justice in the world with the dragon god in the game.
There are wars, violence and so on.
The vote includes images of warfare made with cutting, drilling weapons such as row, sword, sword, ax, as well as images of people being torn apart by wild animals and defeated by their flesh.
The player buys characters for money to get stronger.
Esenyurt İstiklal Neighborhood The family who gave their children to the soil the following day after the incident on 25 July at the house in Köknar Street continued to claim murder.
Father Mehmet Ekinci said, "We are all imaginary doctors, we do not think that it can harm us or anyone else because of the game." He said: "They wrapped elastic waistband and knotted on the side."
I found it, man.
We certainly do not think that your son can commit suicide or hurt himself and others because of a game over the internet.
We knew we were playing such a game.
It was not a game where she played a clown.
Let's just say he's got a little bit of boredom left.
Anne Gulizar Ekinci said, "There is no entry into the building.
At a certain hour my child is told to enter the house.
None of them hold each other.
When his brother came home, he had one chair.
"But when the funeral was held, there were 2 chairs near the computer," he said.
İlker KARAŞ: Could be infected
The families generally do not pay attention to this issue.
"My child is at home, what happens if they are looking at".
The child communicates with many people via games.
There could be a borrowing lending situation, or swearing.
Or invite a person in the ball to the house, there may be a problem between them.
It may have remained in effect because of problems with other people who are communicating through play rather than direct play.
The visuality of the game, the fiction may have thought the child was real.
Suicide may be related to extortion trauma blackmail.
If the child is confronted with complaints from the family, there is also a situation of entanglement because he can not solve this problem.
The game itself can not have committed suicide.
There is also the possibility of the child being infected.
He might have been infected.
There can not be anything that the child could have done on his own.
Information systems consultant Füsun NEBİL: Families should know the interaction of their children
We can not say the games are harmful.
Research shows that games are useful for children's development.
What is important here is to note how the children of mothers and fathers play and how to speak to the players online.
Families should know what effects children are affected and take precautions.
There are only two children in the 5th year who are said to have died because of the vote in Turkey.
This shows that ending a child's life is not just the effect of games.
What did this kid push this?
First we need to find out.
You need to look at the sociology and psychology around the child.
8-month return on Istanbul Stock Exchange stood at 50 percent
The BIST 100 index continued its uptrend that began in December 2016 in July and carried its upward trend to the eighth month in a row.
Thus, for the first time since July 2007, the index has risen by more than 8 months, with an increase of 45.3 percent in this period.
The BIST 100 index, which has surpassed the world's major stock exchanges, including Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, has not yielded a return-based leadership in July.
The BIST 100 index, which has completed a 7.06 percent increase in July, was up 2.54 percent, followed by the Dow Jones index in the US and the FTSE 100 index in the UK, with 0.81 percent.
The DAX index in Almaya and the Nikkei index in Japan ended in July with devaluation.
Looking at the January-July period, it was seen that the BIST 100 index displayed a high performance both from the major world stock exchanges and the emerging market stock market indexes.
The Dow Jones index with 10.76 percent increase, the DAX index with 5.55 percent value gain, the Nikkei index with 4.55 percent rise, and the FTSE 100 index with 3.21 percent increase were followed by the BIST 100 index, which gained 37.6 percent year-on-
The indicative MSCI EM index for emerging market stock exchanges yielded 23 percent.
The BIST 100 index has shown similar performances in the past when looking at the historical process.
The BIST 100 index, which recently completed its 8-month high between December 2006 and July 2007, increased by 38.3 percent in this period.
In addition, the BIST 100 index finished well over 8 months from August 1996 to March 1997, and up 9 months from May 1997 to January 1998.
Emek Can Ümüt, the Investigative Research Manager of Meksa Investment, said that the BIST 100 index continued its rise for 8 months in the statement made to the AA correspondent, indicating that the rise since the beginning of the year exceeded 37 percent.
Ümüt stated that the MSCI emerging market (EM) index has risen by 23 percent, even if we look at these ratios, we have a positive outlook:
The flow of funds to developing countries has continued since the beginning of the year.
In particular, funds in search of higher returns prefer higher interest countries.
As a result, the domestic market is affected positively.
Of course, risk taking appetite on a global scale is also quite high.
In this respect, stock indexes which are in the status of risky assets are in demand.
In the US, we see new record levels tested almost every week in line with the S & P 500 index rising nearly 11 percent since the beginning of the year.
At the beginning of the year, the US Central Bank (Fed) raised the interest rate forecasts for the three major markets, but pointed out that the Fed has used its spoken direction policy fairly well and lifted the uncertainty, Ümüt noted that the Fed has a market insensitive to interest rate hikes.
The Ummah said that inflation in the US is not yet at the desired level, that the Fed will not be hasty in raising interest rates, and that it expects to avoid radical moves is also very effective at current pricing.
"Even though the US economy is growing faster thanks to Trump, the fact that promises have not been made positively impacted the stock market for a while, strengthens the Fed's grip on the market and the market in response to faster growth and faster inflation," said Ummut, who said US President Donald Trump's ability to cancel health care reform, known as "Obamacare", could not fulfill its promises of expansionary fiscal policy.
Ümüt pointed out that in terms of Turkish markets, 2016 is a year in which many negativities are experienced, he said that he is trying to close the gap according to the similarities of the negative biased and over-sold BIST 100 index.
Noting that they did not see a strong recovery with the domestic-based news flow, Ümüt noted that the current outlook could be interpreted as triggering an increase in risk appetite abroad and a desire to close the gap according to similarities in domestic markets.
Ümüt, who technically tested the new record with 108,600 levels BIST 100 index, followed by some sales of snow, said:
Especially 109.500-110.000 zones are a critical threshold in the short walks.
It is normal for profit sales to occur after approaching these levels.
We think that a new local or global story has to be formed for pricing over 110,000 short-lived.
For now, going down 107,500 supports may trigger profit sales.
In this case, even though we follow 107.000 intermediate supports, I think that you can see it loose up to 106.000-105.500.
In particular, the breaking of 105,500 support can bring back retreats to 104,300, which is equivalent to 50% of Fibo's rise from 100,000 to 108,600.
Both the Fed and the European Central Bank's (ECB) decisions will be at the focal point of the global market, he said, although the Fed's expectations are already clear, but the FOMC's interest rate is not expected to increase in September, the commissioning of the downsizing program could trigger a strengthening of the US dollar.
Ümüt said that this could trigger snow sales in the emerging market (GOÜ) stock indices in the short-term over-bought spot, saying "What is important is what the ECB will say."
After the July monetary policy meeting, ECB President Mario Draghi voiced their intention to discuss the course of monetary policy in the autumn, and this rationing provided the euro / dollar parity to rise above the 1.1700 level.
Therefore, the statement that the monthly 60 billion euros asset purchase program will be reduced or terminated will mean that the post-Fed liquidity on the global scale will also be reduced by the ECB.
"Therefore, negative pricing may be initiated on behalf of countries that have high current account deficits such as Turkey and foreign fund access is mandatory."
Gedik Investment Investment Advisory Manager Erol Gurcan stated that after the election of Trump in the US in November 2016, there was a very serious rally in terms of global stock market.
Gurcan said that it is possible to say that Trump is the main driving factor in this rally movement, which is the development of global growth expectation, especially its promises for tax cuts.
Stock Exchange Istanbul was also at the forefront of the global stock market rally.
One of the most important reasons for this is that while the BIST 100 index has remained relatively flat compared to similar developing country markets in recent years, the steps taken by policy makers to support economics and financial markets have also played a significant role.
In particular, we can say that the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF), which became active as of March, is a serious impact on the upward trend observed so far.
In the rest of the year, Gürcan said that positive developments reflected significant price increases and that the KGF, which plays an important role in this uptrend, is also slowly filling up. Gurcan said that the BIST 100 index is still in decline compared to comparable country markets, but that a search for a new story for the rest of the year may slowly come to the forefront.
Gurcan noted that improvements such as the highly anticipated 180-day action plan to share a more detailed details, making the regulations for supporting the company's profits, such as increasing the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, and the possible tax reduction from the current period in the near future could contribute positively in this sense.
"The possibility of the ECB to terminate the asset buying program in the near term and the BOE to be the key central banks of the developed developed countries that will raise interest after the Fed will be major developments," Gurcan said, adding that the central bank of the Fed, the ECB and the Bank of England will gradually tighten their existing expansionary monetary policy stance.
In the upcoming period, Gürcan said that the upward trend observed in the index from the beginning of the year and the support zone of 104,150-104,600 corresponding to the 200-hour moving average are very critical, and that the correction movement could continue to 101,700, 100,000, 99,200 levels respectively in case of breakage of this support zone.
Gurcan said that if the current uptrend is preserved and the current historical peak level of 108.605 is broken, the index could rise to 110.000-112.000.
Kabul convoy attack: killed in NATO military suicide attack
Authorities say a suicide bomber in Afghan capital Kabul has attacked a military convoy, killed a NATO soldier and wounded several.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the NATO statement.
Unidentified local sources say three civilians were killed in the incident in the Karabakh region of the city.
Bombing The latest violence this month in Afghanistan, more than 30 people died Tuesday in a mosque explosion in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In the NATO statement, it was stated that the explosion was attacked with a "personnel-guided hand-made explosive" in the patrol duty with the Afghan army on Thursday evening.
In the statement, it was said that all the wounded were in good condition and were being treated in the US military hospital in Bagram air base.
Reporters say the Taliban is an important source of concern for the growing power and NATO forces in Karabagh, a group known as the Islamic State (IS), who are stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, Afghanistan witnessed at least 1662 civilians killed, with an average of 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomber killed at least 30 people in the mostly Shiite area of Kabul.
The Taliban attack said they did it.
On May 31, after a US-led force removed the Taliban from power in 2001, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people in the most deadly militant attack on the country.
The act of violence emphasizes the unstable security situation in Afghanistan when US President Donald Trump puts his weight on increasing or decreasing the number of US troops that aid the army and police in the country.
Reporters say that in recent weeks suicide bombings in Kabul have led to crimes in the public opinion of the ruler, his policies, and in particular of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA has decided not to delay the pollution after the lawsuit
The US Environmental Protection Agency returned after a day later that the 15 state organization sued on the initiative, delaying the law, which demanded that the provinces avoid obstacles to emissions causing dirty water.
EPA announced its decision to work with the provinces late Wednesday, saying it would continue with "2015 Ozone Resolutions".
EPA president Scott Pruitt said in a statement, "We believe in dialogue with our state partners and that they are sensitive to them."
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA intends to postpone ozone decisions by one year until October 2018, with the current smog pollution being measured in various parts of the country and it is decided where the interruption is required to meet the more stringent air quality standards.
The 15 provinces, mostly Democrats, and the Columbia District filed a lawsuit on Tuesday that said the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration continues to search for Trump to revive the wide range of environmental regulations passed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda called revitalizing economic growth.
But these efforts have led to the reaction of Democrats and conservative groups worried about the impact of more emissions on public health.
EPA's website says ozone-depleted breathing can "reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms like asthma".
The forest gave a good news ...
Transfer stoppers and wings!
Besiktas President Fikret Orman, Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and stopper transfer to Bein Sports had to explain.
Fikret Forest said ...
There is no surprise in the transfer.
Our goal is not too much transfer, point shot.
Now we will do a stopper and wing transfer.
We have Champions League matches, I hope we draw a good draw.
We have to make a wing transfer.
10 million euros is very easy but we do not have such a budget.
If we come to the budget we say, we transfer, and if we do not, we do not die.
It is not possible to inform about the lens unclearly.
We are a public company.
Patience is salutation.

CHP Ankara deputy Murat Emir said "All of Ankara has security problem, only Gökçek's organizations do not have security problem."
Ankara Independent deputy Aylin Nazlıaka moved the ban to the Assembly.
Nazlıaka, who offered the Prime Minister's request to answer, said, "Does this ban clearly reveal the AKP's hostility to the republic and Atatürk?" How do you think that the millions that will celebrate August 30 in the fields?

Qatar: The embargo is hurt in the hours thanks to Turkey
Qatar Economy and Trade Minister Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani said they would like to express their gratitude to the people of Turkey.
Al Thani: "I am honorable and thank you very much for your support."
I convey the greetings of the Emir of Qatar to my brother, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Qatar's economy proved its resistance.
In many countries, our economics are firm while the economies are adversely affected.
For Qatar to be independent and strong, we must work with our own strength.
Thanks to Turkey in the hours of the barbaric hours against us, we were greatly rushed.
We have no shortage of things at the moment.
Our natural resources, natural gas exports give great support to Qatar's economy.
We are not affected by Turkey from the mercilessly executed and against the law.
Today, Qatar continues to produce natural gas and LNG worldwide.
"After the survivors, our natural gas exports did not decline but on the contrary, we experienced an increase of 30 percent," he said.
"We have a volume of $ 554 million in the first quarter of our trading volume," said Al Thani, who said that relations with Qatar and Turkey continue to work in all areas.
The recent decisions have played an important role in this.
Accelerating the entry of goods from Turkey in all the sectors that have proved itself in the Qatar market as well as Turkish products is very important for us in terms of investing in many areas.
"Thank you very much for your constructive attitude towards us," he said.
The cost of recent disasters is 300 million TL
TSB Chairman Can Akın Çağlar said that after the floods on July 18, 7 thousand damage claims were filed to the insurance companies for TL 116 million, 800 damage claims were received for 12 million TL in the Gökova earthquake on July 21 and 22 thousand claims for 168 million TL in the floods and floods in Istanbul on July 27 and the cost of insurance for the last three cases amounted to 300 million TL.
Çağlar, "Damage caused by insurance coverage in terms of insurance is 3 thousand 500 pounds of damage per vehicle, glass damage is around a thousand pounds."
"If the earthquake is the average housing damage is 6 thousand pounds," he said.
Can Akın Çağlar emphasized that they have made intensive efforts as a sector to compensate for the economic losses and stated that there is no housing insurance for every 4 people and that there is no fire insurance for each of the 2 enterprises and that there is no insurance for every 2 people.
Due to the low insurance rate in our country, the risk of serious damage costs of our citizens and institutions grows day by day.
All of these costs should not be left on the state.
Insurance policies are not as expensive as you might imagine, insurance is not just a sector that pays damage, it also carries out risk management consulting.
Increasing the insurance awareness and insurance ratio is very important for our people and our country.
Can Akın Çağlar writes, "Under the general conditions of insurance, insurers must report their damages within 5 working days and this time is over."
"Will it be an insured victim?" Replied the following question: "In general terms, such a period of time is 2 years in the Commercial Code."
"In addition, those living in natural disasters, so the insurers do not need to panic, do not pay no company," he said.
The German media saw the giant bid like that!
At a time of increasing difficulties between Turkey and Germany, Turkey's first Wind Energy Renewable Energy Resource Areas (YEKA) contract was won by the German company Siemens.
The German media announced this development as "German giant Siemens won the giant tender in Turkey".
DWelle Turkic, YEKA, Siemens-Türkerler-Kalyon consortium announced that the winner of the news, "Consortium, will invest over 1 billion dollars of wind facilities," he said.
It is reported that the number of companies competing against China has fallen from 8 to 2, Chinese Mingyang and German Siemens consortiums have been faced, and Chinese Mingyang consortium has been withdrawn at the beginning of the 30th round.
Berat Albayrak, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, made a statement after the delegation made striking statements about Turkey-Germany relations.
The tender was concluded with the acquisition of the German company Siemens, and we can say that this is an important message to the region and the world.
When we look at Turkey and Germany in terms of 200 years of historical cooperation, I think that this result will make an important contribution to Turkey-Germany relations.
I have been very proud to announce that the tender for the region of Turkey and the world is at the forefront of the most reliable investment countries, no matter how many regional crises in the world.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, they see a possible contest
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who will cross the road to exhibit the most satisfying boxing match for under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The Invincible World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia was in separate rooms at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until they walked down the hallway and saluted the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion Lomachenko.
On Saturdays on Showtime, both fighters were among the top five no-show listeners after the ex-world champion Adrien Broner of four wins, Garcia's eve.
Garcia extended her right hand and said: "How is it going, champ?
Good luck to you. "
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga in ESPN at 7 pm Saturday night.
When the pair posed for photos, Lomochenko's manager Egis Klimar recalled that a potential contender between the fighters would be "perfect".
Garcia reminded me, "I am an old featherweight."
"I rolled it up for the Broner (140 pounds), but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down a little.
He must also go for a lightweight (135 pounds), then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them this. "
Lomachenko joined.
"I need to fight this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on 'pay and watch', setting up a date with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) and firing Lomachenko in a 135-pound opening match this year is part of his strategy and Garcia is also interested in fighting the winner of the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell encounter for the lightweight title on the Forum on September 23rd.
Garcia said, "The fight may be in pay-per-view because all the fans want it," he said, and then stated that the channel is open to him if he offers the best financial package.
We are the main names.
No other name creates such an interest.
When are they ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as a "great fighter" and that he could join Saturday's encounter.
But Lomachenko hesitated to praise Garcia abundantly and said that Riverside thought the three-wheel champion seemed "too slow", "do not look at me, Mikey ... you want the knockout."
Garcia said that he was boxing after the showdown with his fist power.
They both felt that momentum was created for their own encounters.
"This is a fight to be done.
Another fight does not create such interest and rumor.
Garcia said, "I am very happy to deal with this."
Lomachenko said: "I expected the best fighters and he was Mikey.
It will be a great fight. "
Turkish rests from Russia to America
The White House does not consider imposing sanctions on Moscow's pipeline constructions, but sanctions against Russia can increase the cost of these lines.
The reason for this is the increase in the cost of borrowing.
Concerned that Western investment partners were thinking about withdrawing from projects due to sanctions, the Kremlin accelerated the construction of pipelines in return.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which has built the Turkish Flight line planned to reach Turkey from under the Black Sea, accelerated the construction on the request of Gazprom.
Reuters wrote that Gazprom also began construction of a second pipeline parallel to the Turkish Movement "in haste" to export more gas to Europe.
New results of Sweden's asylum assessment test revealed
The final results of the assessment tests of refugees subjected to a new medical age assessment method in Sweden have ruled that more than 80 percent of the test takers are over 18 years old, but not everyone is right to test them.
Sweden's National Forensic Medicine and Drug Administration (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make it easier to assess age in the asylum process after some refugees claiming that they are underage by the Swedish Immigration Office (Migrationsverket) have been criticized for failing to assess their correct age.
Until today, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the test and the Forensic Medicine and Drug Office has concluded a total of 2481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
It was ruled that 80 percent (2002's) were 18 percent or more, and in 25 cases the Department of Forensic Medicine and Medicine ruled that it was "probably 18 and over".
In 432 cases, the result was that someone was "probably under 18".
The tests were done only when the age of the person was suspicious.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine and Drug Administration, the results are consistent with past months.
"We do not see a big difference in statistics compared to the past calendar, figures are very consistent," said The Local'a.
The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that refugees are lying about their ages.
Maysta, the apartment explained the result of the test of 581 and said that there were 442 cases where "the people examined were shown to be 18 years old or older".
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the results of the 581 cases disclosed, 243 found that the case clearly declared that it entered the age of 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method, which involves taking an x-ray of the teeth of 20 years old and performing an MRI scan of the knee joints and then analyzing them by dentists and radiologists, is criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, the endocrinologist of the Karolinska Institute, who evaluates the biological status of people who have studied whether the age of the transition is normally earlier or later.
"I have reasons to think about it, and I do not think it should be the kind of measure used.
Biological age is very dubious to decide this way.
If we can not say for sure, we should not pretend to be like that, "Metro told the journal.
However, the Forensic Medicine and Drug Administration defended the correctness of the Göransson tests: "In general, the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small.
The greatest risk is that the person is just under the age of 18, and in this case the risk is around 10 percent. "
Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque opens today
The Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque, built by Abdülhamit in 1885 with the architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, will be opened with Friday prayers today after the restoration work.
Regional Director Mursel Sarı said that the restoration work started in June 2013 was completed and the glass was made ready for the opening.
Yellow gave the following information: "Restoration work carried out in scope 2."
The first part of the glass was the repair of the main building.
The second part was environmental regulation.
In the first part, about 16 million pounds was spent, and about 11 million pounds was spent for environmental regulation.
First, the wooden dome's bullets were opened, and after they were renewed, the exterior walls, the dirt from the external factors, were purified from the rust.
Drainage related to consolidation was made.
There are very rich ornaments that we see in the glass.
It is a work with star motifs, and it is also very rich in terms of pencil work.
There is a mixed style here.
"The Seljuk sculptures are also seen in the Ottoman and architectural styles that began to become baroque in the 1885s."
ABDULHAMITE HAVE EMERGENCY
"The chandelier in the center of the glass is the German Emperor 2."
There were partial defects, they were refreshed and cleaned and replaced.
It's really a very valuable and important piece.
There are wooden cages that we call selamlık, which are symmetrical on both sides of the glass.
We know that these were made by our great right-wing ruler Abdülhamit Han who made them personally.
Therefore, we have the knowledge that they have done these with their own hands and have been mounted here.
They are still standing here originally.
Yellow said that the opening ceremony of the mosque was expected to be attended by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

The governor of West Virginia has announced that he will change his party.
West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, said Thursday night that he will change his party at a rally with President Trump.
Governor Justice said, "Whether you go or not, the Democrats have left me."
"I will tell you today with many prayers and thoughts ... today I will tell you as the West Virginians, I am no longer able to help you as a Democratic Governor."
The rally drowned in cheers.
Justice added, "So tomorrow I will change my record as a Republican."
"If I were the coach, I thought it was time for you to set up a different game."
Mr. Trump promised to make an important announcement earlier in the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and Democratic candidate Justice did not support Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes says he has five coal mines in his coal business, inherited from his father.
The asset is about $ 1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Congress issued a statement Thursday evening saying that "Governor Justice's party change is another blow to the Democratic Party, who preferred to work to prevent it from making our country big again".
Rna McDaniel, the RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said, "Only the most recent rejection of a party with no more than 15 governorships and fewer provincial legislative assemblies in the history, Governor Justice's announcement is totally uninhibited and can not find a positive, unifying message."
I will do my best for Turkey
Olympic third place, Turkey record.
He was born in Cuba, but F. Turkey came to Turkey for his religion ...
In 2013, he became a Turkish citizen and wore a national form ...
First became the European champion, then the Olympic third ...
Now he is one of Turkey's most important medal prospects in the World Athletics Championship.
Yasmani Capello, who competed in the 400 meter barrier, spoke to SABAH before the championship that will start today.
They did not want you because they did not like their grades in Cuba when they were young.
You've got a coach and you've developed it.
Then they called you once but you did not go.
Some people think you chose Turkey for your money.
What are you saying?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was the separation from the national team.
From that moment on, I can say that I draw a line from what I have experienced to the events I have experienced.
Then I came to Turkey with the invitation of Fenerbahçe club.
Thanks to Fenerbahce for the National Team's initiative.
He offered me an offer for reinforcements.
I opened a new page with Turkey.
I experienced a lot of disability in my youth, but after the opportunities offered to me in Turkey, I have achieved great success in Rio and Amsterdam.
I am looking forward to doing the best in the World Athletics Championship and winning a different title.
In the past days we were at the press conference.
Could you tell us why?
When asked a question about Turkey's possession of me, I think of my childhood, 23 years old Cuban national team is thrown away.
And of course in Turkey people approach me.
When I won the gold medal in the European Championship in Amsterdam, I felt the same while playing the National Anthem.
I could not hold my tears.
I am very grateful to Turkey for giving me the opportunity to realize my dreams.
I am very happy that I belong to the Turkish National Team.
I'll be here till my legs run.
You told me before that you could be a Turkish lover.
You are now with Cuba, together with a Turk.
Do you want to share your experiences?
The biggest increase in being with a Turk is calmness ...
When I compare it with Cuban women ...
The Turkish girls are enjoying their relationships.
Your girlfriend's co-worker at the same time.
Are you all day, for example, are you fed?
He is more sweet than me.
(They both laugh.) Actually, I do not have a very strict diet, but from time to time I get sick.
The coach Massimo Matrone is also often on a diet with a hard warning, but I know that these are for my well-being.
How do you like Turkish food, do you love to eat?
Turkish women are doing very good food, but my darling is doing better.
(Laughs) Dry bean-rice is my first choice.
ONLY RIDE ON IT
My coach in Cuba did not believe me.
Other young people took the place.
After winning the medals in Turkey, we met in Cuba.
Looking at the face, the young athletes next to me showed me and said, "Look, I raised it."
I'm just laughing at him.
SEGMENT MY BREAK
The question of eyeglasses that you wear in races ...
I'm just using it for concentration.
When I wear the glasses, I cut the relationship with the world and I make walls on both sides.
I'm just focusing on the finish line and I do not see anything else.
What is the first thing that comes to mind when we say Tokyo 2020?
Felix Sanchez ...
He won a gold medal at the London Olympics at the age of 35 at the 400 meter barrier.
If he can, I can do it in Tokyo at 33, why not.
TURKCELL SUPPORTS
Turkcell Executive Vice President İsmail Tüm said that Yasmani Capello believes that he will be successful in London and that "we strongly believe that Yasmani will represent our flag in this championship in the best possible way."
We wish all our athletes to compete in London.
"We will continue to support the further development of Turkish athleticism and the greater success of our country."
Coe praises 'sincere' apology for Russia's doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the global athlete's boss, has sincerely described Russia's sincere apology for the doping scandal, but stressed that it was not the right time to re-accept the country's spores.
Russia's athletic boss Dmitry Shylakhtin said that the IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, is correct in sprinting the country and that he is determined to fight doping.
"The gold and silver medals in the competition said that they apologized to all the athletes forcibly taken from them".
Despite his assessments, the IAAF Congress voted for the ban in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think it is a very sincere response, a very sincere presentation today," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The entire council and the whole congress were satisfied ... that the Russian Federation had accepted it, that it had overcome many turbulent days, and that it did everything possible to ensure the restructuring of the federation ..."
Coe said that Russia was "satisfied" that he would accept the re-admission criteria.
"I think it's a very constructive day, and I think it is the way forward, but the Congress supports the proposal that the task force is not the right time to return Russia's rights," Coe said.
"Over the next few months we have to do everything to normalize this situation.
Our guiding principle is that we always want to separate clean athletes from defective systems, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes meeting rigorous IAAF criteria will compete neutrally at the World Athletics Championships, which will start on Friday in London.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia has not yet met a number of criteria for its rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that the drug test was still inadequate and that banned coaches still work freely.
US refuses to 'YPG tank' news
The US Embassy in Ankara stated that no tanks were given to any side that fought in Syria.
YPG claims that hundreds of trucks full of tanks and guns were sent.
The statement from the embassy, titled "The explanation of the false news about the trucks going to Syria"
In a series of incomplete reports in the last few days, it is misleadingly claimed that the US has sent hundreds of trucks full of tanks and weapons to Syria to support YPG.
These reports ignore some basic facts about the current situation in Syria.
The United States has not given any tanks to fight against Deasha in Suriya.
Much of US military assistance, primarily light weapons and ammunition, supports the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) elements in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
Syrian Arabs, including BAK, are fighting to clear the Flame from the area and regain their homes.
President of TYDTA Ermut: Foreign direct investment is above last year
President of TYDTA Arda Ermut stated that 55 percent of all investments coming last year came after the month of July.
On July 15th, there was no decrease in investments due to the attempt of the FBI coup, on the contrary there was an increase, Ermut said.
Perhaps if these conditions did not exist, if there were not some regional developments, we could see a further increase with multiplier effect.
Because of that, we are more hopeful for next year.
Hopefully it will be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
Already in the first 5 months, we are going with an increase of 11 percent compared to the first 5 months of last year.
But we do not find it enough.
"We hope to have more."
"Whether global or regional developments do not worry us," says Ermut, emphasizing that investors are trying to diversify.
Ermut, normally reminiscent of 75 percent of direct investments from Europe until 2010, he continued, saying:
This figure fell to 66 percent.
Again, Asia's share rose from 2 percent to 7-8 percent.
Russia's share has increased.
When we tried to do this, the Gulf states had some problems among themselves.
There are good relations with all of Turkey, especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar are two important actors.
But the problem between these two countries hurts us and allows investors to postpone their decisions a little longer.
We are not just investing in Turkey, but we may be experiencing some delays.
Arda Ermut reminded that last week there were some events about Germany but the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, reacted clearly and precisely to this situation.
When Erdogan's reaction to the investors of the countries where the most severe political crisis is experienced, he said, "Look, problems will be among governments, absolutely not among the peoples."
Secondly, these people came and invested in my country.
These are no different to us for Turkish companies.
On the contrary, they will come to us with the slightest problems, we will solve.
"We will not allow them to be victims," Ermut said, adding that they are continuing to support all investors with ease.
Ermut, "in the coming period, we can give this assurance."
You will see that neither the German companies nor the investors from any of the countries where we have any political problems in politics will suffer.
On the contrary, I hope that we will make a full impetus to increase the investments from these countries.
We think that the investments from here will continue to increase.
Of course, political developments can sometimes influence perceptions about the investment climate.
"But at this point we will make a drop on top of us and we will make all of our investments aimed not to affect our investors' perception of the investment environment."
President of TYDTA Ermut said that after the single-generation one-way strategy, Turkey started to receive great interest from China, but if the problems in the Gulf were solved, they would expect the biggest investment from the Gulf.
"Ermut, who used expressions, noted that there are companies coming, coming and following, in the relations with Germany," We had difficulties with these relations and we had investments because of this incident and we are running away. "
"Right now, the portfolio is about 10 percent of the projects in the German companies," Ermut said.
In other words, almost 10 percent of the companies that are seen from all over the world are German companies.
Some of them are companies that already have investments in Turkey.
The man has an idea to enlarge his investment or something, and that is what we are open to as a project.
"So German companies are actually still an important part of our daily business," he said.
Emphasizing that all state institutions should be careful during the periods when perception operations are conducted in Turkey, Ermut expressed that the subject is sensitive and could be affected by the slightest bad communication.
Ermut, a good lesson in the last 2-3 weeks, said the living, said:
The agenda of investors and politics is always different.
We have always seen that economic relations always provide a way for political developments to sit.
Germany will continue to be an important trading partner and an important investor.
Because they already have a lot of investments in Turkey.
Unfortunately, the election agenda in Germany is raising such discourses.
I think they will also go through a little bit more.
In the case of Saudi Arabia, the two countries are careful not to make a negative statement.
As a result, an investor who invests in Turkey invests in targeting all the surrounding country markets.
So there were some slowing processes not because of Saudi Arabia but because of the uncertainty in the region.
But we still have negotiations with these investors.
My personal opinion is that investors are waiting for a decision that they might be able to get to more quickly.
"We see uncertainty due to the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia in the negative sense, I am out of here," says Suudi investor.
On the contrary, we still have Saudi investors who continue to live in Turkey, meet here while we are on holiday, and follow all their processes.
Arda Ermut reminded that last year's international direct investments (FDI) coming to Turkey were 12.3 billion dollars, "I think we will definitely pass this year.
"But how far we will go, these regional developments will affect global uncertainties," he said.
Ermut, indicating that he might be a bit more limited in the same way as he normally hopes, would probably be a little more limited, but pointed out that he was going with an increase of 11 percent in the first 5 months and pointed out that this could be protected. "I hope that if there is no bad improvement, I will definitely finish better this year or last year than last year."
Pointing out that a significant part of the investments will continue to be real estate, Ermut has learned that new investments can be seen in logistics, health, fintech, information, petro-chemistry, food, energy and manufacturing.
Emmut also emphasized that the new investments will be made in the coming months, "a near-term investment in manufacturing can be an anonymous."
Not a billion dollars, but a big investment.
"There may also be investments from interesting countries."
4 wine companies 9 days operation: 55 detention
Istanbul Anti-Smuggling Crimes Branch managers found that the bandollar bottles were not adhered to the bottles by keeping the folio coatings covering the mushroom tapes on the products sold by the 4 wine companies long and loose and they were marketed after the products were sold and sold to the newly produced wines.
Olis claimed that the government lost tax of 20 million 400 thousand pounds due to the repeated use of the suspects' banners.
55 adrese policemen in Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirdag, Bursa, Balikesir, Manisa, Aydin, Denizli and Nevşehir are among the 4 wine companies.
A total of 55 people were taken into custody, while 15,000 sales of ready-to-drink wine, 52,480 bottles of TAPDK flagged hooded wine bottles, 12,890 TAPDK flagged hoods, 3 guns and ammunition, 100 boxes of sexual pills, 992 illegal cigars, 698 bottles of false drinks and 100 liters of aniseed essence were seized.
55 people taken into custody were brought to the Directorate of Anti-Smuggling Crimes Branch in Vatan Caddesi.
Suspicious operations are under way.
The operation of his crews to factories, warehouses and businesses was reflected on police cameras.
Police crews were checking to see if they were in a warehouse to remove the hoods from the ready-to-sell wine bottles.
A collection of bags of used bottles were recorded for TAPDK flagged hoods and police teams.
How will the financial rules of football affect Neymar's going to Paris?
The rules for preventing the unrestricted expenditure of European football clubs will not prevent Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona to Spain to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
From the prestigious Champions League tournament to the Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body of the European game, which has the power to resist the teams, all sorts of conclusions can be drawn.
In 2011, UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules will mean that PSG will eventually have to demonstrate that Neymar has financed its transfer from huge losses.
He has paid Barcelona 222 million euros ($ 262 million) to buy just Brazil out of the contract, and Neymar will pay a salary of tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some financial aspects of Neymar's trip to France are:
The team, of course, will pay PSG Neymar a signature, and add it to the other stars galaxy, given the wealth of energy from the Qatari family.
The clubs are allowed to spend money to buy players, but they have to balance it with legitimate sources of income, with the head of the football business.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA presidency in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that went to great debts in pursuit of success were effectively fraudulent, and that if they were to attract bankers or owners' support, they were under risk of bankruptcy.
In 2011, the FFP began to monitor its losses rather than focusing on the clubs' debts.
The change meant that the model that Roman Abramovic first used in Chelsea in 2003 (buy a potential club, spend a lot to improve his brace and create a global brand) turned into a more difficult undertaking.
During the 3-year FFP evaluation period, which lasts until 2018, the clubs can spend 30 million euros.
Although Platini has been dismissed in a disreputable presidency in 2015, it is still determined that the successor to UEFA Aleksander Cferin will be given up without overspending.
Andrea Traverso, who oversees the FFP in UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: "FFP has certainly not died and we will definitely strengthen the rules by moving forward."
Although PSG will pay Neymar's purchasing material collectively, it can extend the contract period due to accounting reasons.
Neymar has signed a 5 year contract, so the transfer fee can be shown as a 44.4m euros in annual accounts for the next 5 years.
The first wave in 2014 saw the implementation of the heaviest sanctions in Manchester City, where FFP officials, PSG and Abu Dhabi were the owners.
The PSG was then sentenced to 60m euros (then $ 82m), down 20m euros, and was ordered to limit the Champions League team to 21 players instead of 25 for the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is vigilant against clubs that can try to trick financial regulators by inflating their income through corporations linked to club owners.
A value-added company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market value, UEFA will not allow it to be considered as a justifiable income.
It was when UEFA ruled that the PSG sponsorship of the Qatar Tourism Authority was inflated in 2014.
It was reported that Neymar's portion of the earnings from PSG could come through the payments of Qatar's 2022 World Cup organization committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will be the World Cup ambassador, and such a move can be easily uncovered by UEFA regulators.
The sanctions imposed on PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be even more cautious against attempts to circumvent rules.
UEFA is not in a preventive talks with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that they were not authorized to talk about the situation of PSG.
Recent accounts show that PSG 2015-16 has a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's development to contribute to sponsorship agreements, gift and form sales.
The club expects at least a 30 percent increase after the signing.
The Spanish league, which was clearly disturbed by one of the biggest players of football, tried to prevent Neymar's departure from claiming that PSG violated the FFP.
"This is an open 'financial doping' case with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas said in the Spanish newspaper ASA that Qatar has a definite proprietary PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsenal, whose club belongs to an American sports giant, shares his concerns about La Liga financing by a state.
"This is a result of ownership and in the last 15 years it has completely changed the whole ground of football," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country has a club, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because the representation of a country by such a big player for a country can lead to different methods or different interests.
Insurers' ceiling price rebellion
According to TSB data, the insurance sector has been suffering from traffic disputes since 2006.
The sector, which lost 2.35 billion TL in 2015, achieved only 19 million TL profit in 2016.
Aksigorta, Anadolu Sigorta and Güneş Sigorta are traded in Istanbul Stock Exchange.
Caglar said that the 11 year loss of traffic insurance has reached TL 7.3 billion and that the loss of the sector is projected to be 2.3 billion TL this year and the estimated damage-premium ratio will increase to 125 percent with the application of the ceiling premium.
Saying that 2015 figure will be captured this year, Çağlar pointed out that the loss written in 2012 and 2015 took the profit of other branches and said, "This means that we finance the bad driver and increase the price of the citizen's housing policy."
"75 per cent of the sector is foreign, our partners abroad also have a sense of financing the bad driver," he said.
The ages continued as follows:
We do not expect a profit from the traffic, but we can not show that we have made any profit in the past 11 years.
"We also accept that, but we continue to hope that we can carry it in a reasonable environment, along with other policies."
Saying that the damage in the traffic is the dramatic price increases when the profitability of the other products is taken away, Çağlar said, "In 2012, the traffic insurances had price increases of around 30 percent, it almost doubled in 2015, we wrote the biggest damage of our history."
"Even in an environment where the prices have so increased, we had only 19 million TL in traffic at the end of 2016," he said.
Saying that they expect to pass free tariffs next year, Çağlar said, "We will lower the price of the good driver at the free tariff and apply the high price to the bad seller."
"However, the Treasury looks at the general trend, the last word when it will be in the Treasury," he said.
The Undersecretariat of Treasury stated that the increase in the compulsory traffic insurance premiums since 2015 affects a large part of the population and has passed the maximum premium (ceiling price) application since April 12th.
Accordingly, the maximum premiums on compulsory traffic insurances were determined on the basis of provincial groups determined according to each vehicle group, the number of steps and the traffic intensity and accident statistics regarding compulsory traffic insurance policies to be prepared.
On the other hand, as of July, the implementation of the "Risky Insurers Pool" for staged or vehicle groups with high frequency of damage in compulsory traffic insurance has been a mistake.
Premiums and damages related to the traffic insurance policy of the pool will be distributed among the insurance companies.
The premiums of these insurance holders will be determined by the Undersecretariat of Treasury.
Caglar said that with the implementation of the ceiling premium, premium production in the first six months of 2017 decreased by 11.5 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, the number of policies increased by 4.9 percent to 8.6 million, and the discount on traffic policies reached around 30 percent when inflation was taken into account.
Saying that this year's traffic will take profits in other branches again, Çağlar said, "With this ceiling prices, this damage can not be sustained.
How much more can the sector carry this? "He said.
Saying that the capital of all the companies in the sector is 9 billion TL and only 2.3 billion TL is lost from traffic, Çağlar says that the sector's capital will be completed in three years and he looks at "Why do foreigners finance the good driver and the bad driver and why are my thousands of feelings financing the bad driver in Turkey?"
"At this point we are trying to tell the Treasury our deal," he said.
After these developments, on the question of whether foreigners have come to the point of decreasing weight in the Turkish insurance sector, Caglar said, "They have not come to that point yet."
They expect to invest more in Turkey because the Netherlands has an average of 6 policies per person, while in Turkey this is 1.3.
"Therefore, Turkey is a place where we have to grow in real terms," he said.
So they are not giving up here.
However, even though the company achieves a reasonable profit every year, it uses it to grow the company leaving all the profit in the world.
According to TSB data, premium production in the sector was 40.5 billion TL in 2016, while it was 23.1 billion TL in the first half of this year with an increase of 12 percent compared to the same period of the previous year.
Caglar said that the sector predicts that it will not complete the year with 15 percent growth in total premium production.
Gospel of social aid to thousands of chronic patients
Details and implementation principles of the "New Social Assistance Program for Fighting Chronic Diseases", which started working recently with the instructions of Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, Minister of Family and Social Policy, became clear.
In the first stage, 4,300 tuberculosis patients and SSPE patients will benefit from the social assistance program for poor citizens and their families.

Payments will be made through Social Assistance Cards which will be provided through PTT.
Those who are unable to withdraw money due to geographical conditions, illness or disability will be paid at the door.
The program is a first in many respects in the world.
One of the 10 companies to invest is still German
Prime Minister of Turkey Investment Support and Promotion Agency President Arda Ermut said that the German companies in Turkey do not reflect the political tension between the two countries as business firms.
Ermut said, "There are no investors in the relations with Germany, saying 'We are escaping because of this situation.'
"About 10 percent of the projects in the portfolio are German companies," Ermut said.
Some of them have investments in Turkey.
"The Germans are an important part of our daily business," he said.
Ermut voiced the fact that Abraaj Group is a partner in the logistics company Netlog.
Abraaj Group Partner Omar Syed pointed out the economic growth in Turkey and said, "We invested a total of $ 1 billion in Turkey."
Ozer, on the way to becoming the last Ottoman
The management has been informed that the experienced footballer, whom he has given two weeks to find the club, agrees with Osmanlıspor and is going to sign a formal contract in the coming days.
At the beginning of last season, Özer Hurmacı signed a contract for green-black club until 2019 with 4 hours remaining at the end of the transfer. 29 league, 2 cups match, 5-goal performance with 4 assists performance has made a significant contribution.

Century's transfer took place!

Speaking after the signing ceremony, Neymar said he was very happy to be in the form of a representative in France. "Ever since I started living football in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most challenging and ambitious teams."
Having come to this club and having my teammates join us as we would like our fans to get many trophies ".
PSG will pay Neymar 45m euros each season.
Thus, the cost of the star player will cost the representative of France over 400 million euros.
The naval workers are over with the greed

Nostalgia becomes niche with "Wet Warm American Writing" and "Comrade Detective"
This version of the story is nostalgic for all, before the stars continue to do more with Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd for the glorious days of the characters in the 80s, the grunge period for the characters in the 90s (when brains like David Wain and Michael Showalter performed the sketch comedy "The State" for the 80s)
As a cultural product, this is the permanent remembrance of our Facebook era, both in terms of recruiting and embodying.
But in a series, as if the run was exhausted.
The "First Day of the Camp" was unexpectedly successful, and it was not only due to absurd humor (there was a story about the origins of a talking box plant, spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
Focusing on the essence of comic (middle aged actors playing tricky children), he realized that it was impossible to recapture the past part of the joke.
The parody is now more random, including the monologue about the perverse pursuit of the 90's, "The Hand That Rocks Five", which is now less emotionally based and the adults are playing adults, "Ten Years Later".
At one point, the character mixes an Apple Powerbook, some single-row roller skates, and "a lot of other stuff from 1991".
Many of the main stories are the same.
Soft-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter) is no longer a writer, yet he has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity.
There is also another crazy treacherous plan involving Ronald Reagan (again Mr. Showalter), now dominated by George H. W. Bush (a well-imitated imitation by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the coolest part is the best part.
It's nice to see Mr. Rudd, who is always young, especially with Matt Dillon's underbelly beard on "Singles", who seems to be the oldest and most popular child of Andy.
Wet Warm American Writing: Twenty Years later, in the final scene of this, the friendship spectacle "Wet Warm American Writing" lets you go to see the gala of filminin, as long as it reaches what I think it to be my logical end result in a series of random moments of insanity (for example, some sort of repetitive "Seven Up!").
In the meantime, "Comrade Detective" in Amazon appeals to a different nostalgia: "The Americans" is the Cold War resurrection, the film "Blonde Bomb" and even "GLOW" with iconography against the East, Western wrestling.
The comedy directed by Rhys Thomas, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, looks like TV found: an 1980s Romanian police friendship drama in which two Bucharest police officers fought for true, atheistic and Marxist-Leninist roads.
The main roles are played by wolf Gregor and idealistic Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue is done by English dubbing Channing Tatum (who is also the chief producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a very bright idea.
But this is not too much of an idea.
There are some nice visual comic (cops watch the chess on TV while Americans watch football)
Among the famous voice actors are Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny, which is a good material for the "Who knows the sound" game.
But "Comrade Detective" is so devoted to simulating the reality of a blatant propaganda propaganda (including a Reagan mask killer), mostly playing just like him.
Six long episodes do not pass and comedy is not quick enough or frequent.
While Gregor and Iosef regularly visited the American embassy in their lobes, where two fat men were eating a bunch of hamburgers, such as hungry wolves, "Comrade Detective" could shorten the length of propaganda to a narrower length.
The imaginary communist watcher's message is that Western cultures can turn any thing into a series of food to eat.
Fiction Romanian creators are not unfair: We do this to our own near past and even to theirs.
The Athenian Kadnians
The British Government has seen that our family of fifty years of experience is loyal and self-sacrificing.
The supreme authorities of the government have accepted that this family has been sincerely attached to the British Government and has been in great service since long.
The British government should be careful and intelligent about this seedlings planted with its own hands, to thoroughly investigate and examine everything carefully.
While attempting to understand FETO, the organization of the Hashish as a starting point is handled, but the forgotten difference is that FETÖ is an organization emerging in the imperialist era and acting with colonial motives.
In this regard, the 'pioneering movement' that I have to deal with is my opinion Kadyani.
In the British praise of the initiative, Mirza Gulâm Ahmet Kadiyani is the founder of Kadiyânîlik, who defines himself as 'saplings planted with the hands of the British Government'.
Gulâm Ahmed, a small town in the Punjab province of India, declared that on 1 December 1888 Allah ordered his followers to take allegiance and form a separate community.
Gulâm Ahmed went a little further and said that in 1891, according to the revelations and inspirations he received, he sent Mary as a natural death like other nebîs, and that God sent Himself as the Messiah and the Mahdi which Christians and Muslims expected.
According to this, the Messiah and the Mahdi that the Muslims expected are the same person and this is Mirza Gulâm Ahmad Kâdiyani.
(Islamic Encyclopaedia, TDV)
Gulâm Ahmed, who wrote books defending the oppressed Muslims against Hindus and Christians, is thought to have been founded entirely with moralistic motives, but the CIA support reminds him of the portrayal of Gulen who defended Islam against irreligion and the President of the Association for the Struggle against Communism in Erzurum afterwards emerged in India which came under British rule in 1857 after the Sipahi uprising.
Like Gülen, Gulâm Ahmed's most beloved idea of the imperialists is that "jihad" is a struggle that Muslims only do with their own souls, and that imperialism can not be a dimension to fight if you can live your religion freely.
Even if you remember, Gulen went a step further and praised in a preaching sermon in our history that we even passed the attacks of the Crusaders who are still open: "It is not dangerous for the Crusaders to invade our country.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
For once they do not wear your girl, your girl.
Mabedinze do not engage, the unbroken Crusaders!
The idea that the Mahdi and the Messiah united in itself, the idea that their community would be the savior of Islam, the concept of jihad just means struggle with the nihilism, aside from the similarity of the thesis with the FETO, the spreading of Kadiyanism took place in the field of education and civil society in general.
The total number of centers of the Kadians in the world who are said to have exceeded 2 million in number of 'Arabs' is 1869, and the number of countries officially registered as "Humanity First" is 23.
There are also 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensaries in 55 countries, only 8 printing houses belonging to Kadiyani in Africa, 505 educational establishments in 11 countries and about 16.000 mosques in the world.
We can see more clearly the depth of the approval of the global powers to the Qadiyanians, if Professor Abduselam, the Nobel Prize winner, Professor Abdusselam, Sir Zaferullah Khan, who is the head of the United Nations Justice Department, is Mahdi Khali Ali, the Muslim actor who received the first Oscar award.
Let's not forget that the meeting of the cadets with their 30,000 people last week in England was also brushed as a hull demonstration.
A brief overview of their history is enough to understand that the Kadiyanians, who are one of their slogans, "Love everyone, do not hate anyone," actually mean "love your occupiers / colonists".
It is possible to drive the starting point and motivation of the structures such as the Compilation, FETO or Tahir al-Qadri up to the Kadiyani, and all of these organizations are actually supported by the imperialist paradigm in order to serve societies in order to serve colonialism.
Kargodan "last supply" output
Emily Pomeranz (50), who spent her last days in a hospital in Washington due to pancreatic cancer, expressed her longing for a coffee and chocolate-mixed milkshake (milkyhake) in a townhouse where she was born.
A friend of the woman, Tommy's, was contacted with the owner of the restaurant.
Tommy Fello, who has been running the same restaurant for 47 years, has put his dry drink in the bucket and paid a fee of 123 dollars (435 TL) and sent it to the hospital 600 kilometers away with a "quick delivery" cargo.
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul
Until today, Ahmet Kul Construction, which has been living up to major projects such as Lavinya Park, Autoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, Dia Mare in Mimaroba in Istanbul and Solse 7 projects in Bodrum Yalikavak.

753 million transferred to affiliate companies
Barış Yarkadaş said that 6,760 personnel were working in TRT and that many programs had been made out and that prices were paid for.
CHP deputy, "TRT 2016" again the nation's taxpayers took the AKP companies. "
"This is the name slang," he said ...
The source that TRT transfers to its subsidiary production companies is revealed by the data obtained from official documents.
The official response to the application made by CHP Istanbul deputy Barış Yarkadaş in the framework of the Information Act revealed how TRT's resources were spent.
Yarkadaş said that TRT, which has 6,760 people working as permanent staff, has transferred 753 million 500 thousand TL in 2016 to prospective companies through programs made under the name of foreign production, despite all technical possibilities.
The CHP deputy used the phrase, "This means emphasizing the meaning".
Barış Yarkadaş, "AKP journalists and businessmen of the production companies TRT is literally pouring."
"Millions are being paid for the productions that are not being watched or not known to be withdrawn," he said.
Recalling that the money transferred to the companies is collected from the tax of the people, Yarkadaş said, "The institution with 7 thousand personnel has returned to the AKP's arsenal."
"These companies, 7 thousand people can not do what they signed the program did they get the money?" He showed the reaction.
TRT's advertising revenue in 2016 is 224,456,182 TL explaining Yarkadaş, staff salaries and other expenses accounted for the ad revenue on the eve of the account, he said.
Yarkadaş, "AKP has become the voice of the TRT, can not get ads because it is not watched."
Feed journalists are getting money from TRT and are ticketing for AKP.
"The folks are attracted to the burden," he said.
The CHP's Yarkadaş continued his words as follows: "The TRT staff pays 660 million TL annually, but gives all the work to foreign productions."
753.5 trillion of the people of the TRT'den people in the pocket has been drawn to the next.
This is downright disgraceful.

Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected that interest rates will soon change after the Bank of England reduces speculation that slow economic growth and an increase in inflation are likely.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue to be "slow" due to the narrowing of family incomes and the fact that they keep interest rates constant.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decision-makers in the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, so fewer members were asked to increase this month after slow economic growth weakened support for the increase.
The bank warned that the quarterly inflation report would push growth estimates to 1.7% in 2017, 1.6% in 2018, and that household incomes would continue to shrink, with inflation still expected to rise to around 3% in the spring.
However, he pointed out that interest rate hikes are necessary to rein in Brexit's inflationary inflation over the next few years, and that borrowing costs may be higher than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the huge economic recovery package launched a year ago after Brexit.
The Bank expects to terminate the Seasonal Funding Plan, which offers cheap financing to the bank from next February, but expects to offer £ 15 billion more in the plan (total of £ 115 billion).
"The MPC's central estimate, the gross domestic product (GDP), continues to be slow in the short run as the contraction in domestic real incomes continues to be a burden," the bank said.
Regarding interest rates, he emphasized that "some shrinking of the monetary policy" may be necessary to mitigate inflation and that it will be "a little higher" than the market expects.
Markets are currently estimating that the first increase will be in the third quarter of next year and that someone else will be in 2020.
But the bank stresses that any increase will be "step by step" and "limited".
According to estimates in May, the bank's forecast for reduced growth for this year and next year is 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively.
The bank maintains an estimate of 1.8% in 2018.
The pound slumped against the dollar and the euro after the news.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1,31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1,11 euros.
The amendment decision came after the GDP fell to 0.2% in the three months ahead of the 0.3% in the second quarter, easing disappointing growth expectations.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but will begin to rise slightly towards the end of the year, according to the bank.
The bank says that the contraction will worsen before it gets better, but the latest inflation report leaves little to be loved by households hit by rising inflation and slight salary increases.
The bank said that monetary policy "can not prevent" the shots of revenues in the next few years, but expects salaries to "improve" to the end of their three-year forecasts.
The rising demand for British goods as a result of the weaker pound will support the economy by balancing some of the declining consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the shocking EU pound, which takes the pound upside down, is lowered to 0.25% of the agrostopes following the referendum.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years for it to affect prices and the economy as a whole.
Prior to the bank's latest interest rate decision, there was an increase in inflation pressure on households and an increase in interest rates, triggered by three policy makers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation dropped from 2.9% in July to 2.6% last month, but the bank said it was expected and will rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that their surplus to the 2% target is related to the "completely" weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent declines in exchange rates, the mortgage market will become even more competitive once lenders have the job to do business and close the year in a positive way.
The market seems to be particularly good for the remainder of the current contracts in the re-mortgage market, becoming more popular than ever with many free options and low interest rates. "
NHS will write 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
In the Supreme Court, patients will be able to access 'transitional' HIV prevention treatment from September onwards after a drug-related struggle with the NHS.
NHS UK announced that an estimated 3,000 years of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP), a pre-cumulative pre-sequestration drug, has been shown to reduce risk of infection by 86 per cent in high-risk people,
The Supreme Court's decision last year accepted the court's decision to finance the trial after the Appellate Court's confirmation that the NHS was told that it had the power to pay for PrEP, despite allegations by the local authorities to finance it.
The National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "turning point", while the move was announced Thursday as a 'new and serious intervention' by NHS UK president Simon Stevens.
The public health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first clinics to be enrolled and will be fully implemented throughout the UK by April 2018 with the participation of more clinics in October.
Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a series of HIV medicines that reduce the risk of acquiring HIV before sequestration.
The trials showed that PREP significantly reduced HIV transmission among those at risk of infection.
Before Seksten, getting PREP means that a person has enough of the drugs to prevent the infection of HIV in his body.
Such medicines can be taken every day or until just two hours before having sex.
Suitable for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and HIV-positive partners who can not be cured successfully.
The clinics will identify eligible participants who will be willing to try male, female, transsexual individuals, and those whose partners are not known to have been checked for HIV status with anti-retroviral therapy.
Persons living in the UK and enrolled in a general practitioner may also register for potential participation at participating local sexual health clinics.
The program will hold £ 10 million and the NHS UK has signed an agreement to provide medicines this week with a tender offer from the international community.
The trial was designed to assess the full potential of PREP by gathering clinical evidence on how PrEP is targeted, conducted, and applied on a large scale.
Mr. Stevens said: 'This new and serious intervention will contribute to the successful and widespread efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in thirty years of development in overcoming one of humanity's major health problems. "
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If targeted at those in need and at risk, PrEP offers the possibility of transforming the HIV epidemic in the UK.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will get a new and powerful breakthrough through this NHS-funded experiment in the UK, which is truly private and not open to negotiation, which will lead to many life improvements.
We welcome this announcement warmly. '
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "Priority should now be put to the test on a nationwide basis and ensure that no one with HIV is left behind.
Since the PREP trial is now available, we are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of HIV. '
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow's public health minister, said: 'We welcome the start of the PREP trial, and the months are delayed by months and then the government is late.
Evidence shows how much this medicine can be transformed into a part of how to avoid HIV and to stop the transmission of this life-changing infection
The experiment will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PREP.
Now it is important that this effort is presented as quickly as possible in order to protect people exposed to HIV and bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in the community.

Two secret deaths
Former Industry and Trade Minister Ayhan Çilingiroğlu's daughter Umit Makbule Çilingiroğlu (51), who was born in Washington, lost his life by falling down the 19th floor of a business center used as a hotel in Levent.
Melis Salihoğlu, a student at Koç University, who was 24 years old, was also found dead at home.
It was alleged that Salihoğlu had himself hanged.
Two glazes were investigated as suicide by police officers.
'DEPRESSIVE CARD VARDI'
Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, Turkey's first industrial and commercial minister in 1971 Nihat Erim's government, was born in Washington in 1966. His daughter Umit Makbule Çilingiroğlu entered Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler at 17.00 on August 1st.
Ambulance and police teams were called to the scene when a Kuwaiti tourist informed the hotel management that Çilingiroğlu, who settled in the 19th-floor room and could not be heard for a while, was lifeless.
The health team determined that Çilingiroğlu, who fell to the hard floor of the 19th canteen, lost his life.
Police testifying mother Mediha Çilingiroğlu, "lately was depressed state."
He came to Istanbul from Ankara on July 31st.
I have a granddaughter with leukemia from my other daughter.
"He was interested in my grandson and he was affected negatively by his grandson's disease," he said.
It is expected that Çilingiroğlu, which has been removed from the Forensic Medicine Institution, will be buried in Ankara.
Çilingiroğlu is investigating whether he was shot by someone or committed suicide.
'CANINA KIYDI' ALLEGED
Another suspicious death in Istanbul was in Sarıyer Zekeriyaköy.
Melis Salihoglu, who studied at Koç University, was found dead at home.
According to the allegation, the father of the young girl went to the house near the arrow where her daughter could not hear and her mobile phone could not reach her.
Dad, he was at home with your daughter's lifeless body.
It was alleged that Melis ended her life by hanging herself at her home, which was loved by her family, close friends and friends.
Melis Salihoğlu'nun death family and his relatives drowned.
After Melis, a friend told social media, "A sparkling sun hit a face."
We had the pleasure of running under the feet of lush grass, your best friend Jack, and your sister Eishan in pursuit of that little plastic ball.
He shared the message, "What was needed so that he could die now."
Living in luxury: The mezzanine and smart design numbers have transformed this little Earls Courts apartment into a spacious home.
Former banker Joanne Leigh, a renovated passion for the estate, went from a large house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014 to shrink.
It is on the first floor of a flashy Queen Anne style tarpaulin and proof of the new design that Joanne is convinced of collecting the suitcases.
"Before that, I was living in a much bigger area at Knightsbridge with my ex," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something equivalent to my price.
The apartment at Earl Court was shown to me and had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with him, and I gave him an offer that day. "
After the first appearance, the 1000-square-foot apartment was completely renovated.
Initially, you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom, with a one-room and complicated plan, Joanne wanted to add a storage area and a mezzanine floor to get the most out of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows and lots of light.
This is my condition. "
To this end, the Notting Hill-based architectural and design studio Duck & Shed holds Erfan Azadi to take advantage of the 12.5 foot tandem and create a place that will not only be a building but also a home for Joanne.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two areas over the top, so the architectural difficulty was creating a mezzanine floor in which you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the matter.
"The steel skeleton is quite complicated," he explains.
"We should arrange the gaps so that they stack up without needing to bend down on each other.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but at the same time the steels would tilt so that they would be at the right height relative to the top or bottom function. "
This arrangement brought many additional dramas, allowing Erfan to get two full-size rooms on top of each other.
The old copper type light window from Retrouvius for the mezzanine floor looks at the wonderful living area below.
Mirrored gold-colored furniture, silver accents and old-style Serge Mouille lighting all set the style of the design.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding space, space and light.
The mirrors placed on both ends of the short corridor make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored guard panel gives the feeling of opening the window to another room.
The intervening mirror units provide Joanne with a storage area for all cutlery and kitchenware.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a more spectacular area sensation, is to be able to close the kitchen when it is not in use.
The fold-down kitchens are not new.
The original one is that it can be lifted up in garage style.
Erfan explains, "We used some engineering in that," he explains, polished steel-reinforced MDF door.
"There is a weight of balance, so when you push the door up, it really slips easily."
With the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne has gained an additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom and an improved session plan.
"At the end of the day, you are going to sell the site, or the value of your property is determined," says Erfan.
"As an incident, a real estate agent will come in and make a calculation based on the session area."
Here, while enhancing the floor space, they have succeeded in using quality materials that give the space a luxurious look.
Erfan says, "The materials are the objects you touch, so it helps you to establish an emotional connection at home."
"At home, you will not fall in love with the power lines on the wall.
These things are important, but your heart will not tremble. "
It's a good idea that through a good design and increased square meters an apartment can turn from a standard thing to something quite spectacular.
Actually, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.

Besiktas is expected to make an official statement about the transfer of Jeremain Lens.
Wedding photos of famous couples
Cagla Şikel, who has been in a rough relationship for almost 4 years, and actor and singer Emre Altuğ entered the world house in Sortie.

Brothers fighting for $ 500 million property empire
The two brothers are in battle for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $ 500 million, forty years after the dynasties founded by Italian families.
Colin De Lutis, former Carlton Football Club director and contractor, lives in a manor in Toorak three doors away from his younger brother, Paul, who gives himself up to the Supreme Court about how property and business assets are shared.
Paul had wanted to get out of the family business since 2014, but tough discussions were going on in the Supreme Court about the dismemberment.
Annelies Anna and his brothers have 38 property owners who are worth more than half a billion dollars accumulated since the store they bought in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family built Westco Jeans and enlarged it with a chain of 160 retail outlets.
It was sold to $ 85 million in 1999.
This money was invested and De Lutis' portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento contracting sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments and suburban malls.
Under an agreement with his deceased father, Colin (described by Paul as "an important driving force and dominant personality" in De Lutis's family) has two-thirds of company assets, and Paul has one-third.
A court file says that this means that Colin has $ 316 million and Paul has $ 176 million worth of property.
For Paul, dividing the property and the cash is emerging as a contentious issue.
In his first sworn statement to the court in 2015, he wrote: "The divisions proposed by Colin left him with the property that I had always regarded as their best."
The first Supreme Court trial took place after mediating last Friday with many failures.
The brothers are also at odds over who is going to control the current job, and Paul claims that Colin left him out of work.
Colin argues that this is not true, but he accuses Paul of running some property awkwardly.
Colin says he's hoping to resolve the dispute in a sworn statement he gave earlier.
"My Italian roots dictate that the family is the most important priority."
With hundreds of pages of sworn statements, e-mails, and best-in-class lawyers like Allan Myers, QC, and senior legal advisors held by both parties, the expenses are increasing in the case, as are companies registered with Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were an Italian immigrant family who owned groceries and delicatessens since the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Colin, the family owned the goods to buy the Collingwood property that the first jeans shop opened.
Colin says, "In recent years in high school, Paul set up Westco there when he was a little boy (10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, are hoping to leave their property friendly to their son.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted his brothers to go to court," he wrote.
The other two siblings, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, according to Colin, when he left the job, he paid $ 10 million to Mark and $ 26 million to Luke.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the terms of their financial separation."
According to the biography of Eddi McGuire, the best friend of the television star in 2015, Colin tried not to draw attention even though he was a board member of an old AFL club.
Fairfax Media, Colin and Paul De Lutis and lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded with a text message saying "I can not say much" because the case is in court.
"It was very sad that my brother, Paul, chose to sue me and dragged our families into the courts," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote that a court tried to fulfill his brother's demands in his application.
"Our father, Paul and I did not want us to fall into the present conflict," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful about the solution."
On Friday, this hope seems to have disappeared.
"Our problem will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new private planner plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If it does, it will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House private stay will limit President Trump's information flow (including news media reports) to hoping to keep the boss more stable.
Some minor information from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the White House's new private pen, John F. Kelly, met with senior staff on the first day of his first day, President Donald Trump summarized a fundamental problem he was planning to solve about the White House:
Kelly told the staff that on the paper or in briefings the information had to flow through herself, because the president would be able to make better decisions when well informed.
Kelly's diagnosis is very meaningful, but others have tried to mend Trump by controlling the media diet and they have failed.
President Trump's involvement with television has been on the decades ahead, and he is now in good condition at the White House, watching TV.
"If nominee Trump is sad because he is not fair in the media, demonstrating that he has a fair place in convincing media outlets is an efficiency boost," a former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri from Politico then said, "The key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control is to ensure that the consumption of personal media includes a steady stream of praise," according to six campaign officers.
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit is "under control" at any time is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know about backwards, for example, Trump's tweets will be much more provocative than their intervention.
We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump did not send.
If his staff could take him out even more than once, then the efforts were worth it.
But no one could prevent Trump from constantly creating controversy.
Part of the problem was that the White House consisted of people competing with one another, that is, in any case, working their way to the Trump with their own agendas (which they could be credible or unreliable) and emphasizing their own worldviews.
Politico reported during May this entire tale that consultants tend to strategically submit to someone else questionable information.
An example of what journalist Shane Goldmacher told us in detail:
"Existing and former Trump officials say that Trump's reaction to the negative cuts, especially the evil influent, is violently reacting and finding himself trapped in finding where they originate.
This was also true at the end of February, when one of the principals gave a hard copy of a document that accused the internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson's site GotNews.com of being a special assistant assistant, Katie Walsh, as "the source behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
Whether Johnson was basically banned from Twitter for harassment, or offering no concrete evidence or guilty of misdemeanors in the past, and having returned from them, did not matter.
Trump read the article and the staff started asking about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that private pen at that time, Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter, "is trying to place a system that manages and documents Trump's papers."
How did that work?
Kelly is trying to do the same thing in three months.
Maybe it will emerge as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still in his impulse and his aides are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors will make Kelly's task quite difficult.
Crypto-FETO "cells appeared with special template
İzmir Public Prosecutor Berkant Karakaya completed the investigation that he started on the statement that the Secretary General of Naval Forces Commander, General Admiral Jihad Yayci, is a FETO, under the investigation conducted regarding the irregularities in the "military espionage investigation" and some information leaked under the name of "Sarmaşık".
In the review, it was emphasized that the Commander-in-Chief of the League was not a member of the organization but that the members of the cryptographic organization in the Naval Forces Command had been deciphered and helped the investigation authority and played an active role in the fight with the PTO.
It is underlined that Yayci's fighting attempt on 15 July was an effective struggle against FETÖ from the very first day that Yaycı's coup attempt was declared in a decision to be put to a halt by giving the Marine Corps Command emrine in accordance with the so-called martial law order.
The following statements were used in Karakaya's decision of non-prosecution: "It is understood that Yaycı has been working on the determination of the staff of the crypto Naval Forces Command with a special template for the determination of members of the FETO members belonging to the crypto private service class, and a special system based on 64 basic criteria and 209 sub criteria.
On the contrary, there is no evidence about the name of the secret witness other than a declaration based on a specific and stubborn effort, which has been observed in the forensic investigations, and the conclusion of the struggle that the secret witness has shown is contrary to an active terrorist organization and it has come to a conclusion that it is not possible for the prosecutor to be valued by a judgment based on the predominant contributor.
General Admiral Yayci had previously been tried on charges of insult.
It turned out that the back of this was again the FETÖ's and that the alleged crime was calumny.
Former Air Pilot Staff Colonel Hakan Dinç, who complained that Yaycı had insulted himself, said that the old Adana Incirlik 10.
Tanker Base Commander Air Pilot Brigadier General Bekir Ercan Van was exiled from the Turkish Armed Forces due to his connection with former Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, a former Chief of General Staff Colonel Muharrem Köse who was allowed to investigate, Lieutenant General Mustafa Özsoy, former Chief of General Staff Mustafa Özsoy, former Judge Major Ercan Ağın, former Navy Captain Necmettin Aksoy, former Judge Captain Akif Us and former Judge Captain Akif Us and former Judge Lieutenant Serdar Çamiçi and Yaycı.
Some members of the organization, including Tuncay Opçin, who was a FETOR firarisi, were aimed at Yaycı by sharing in social media before and after the coup attempt on July 15th.
The travelers went back to the 'rich neighborhood'
Some of the wealthiest hosts in the West Midlands are fighting again with elusive travelers over the hunt drawn by the council to take back the area outside their own mansions.
Travelers have parked 20 caravans outside an area called "the neighborhood of the riches", which is the spot where Solihull's carpeted spot.
The council returned after being expelled in May, bringing horses, babies, and a full load of cars, not ditching ditches to cut off their raids.
The clever group found a vacuum in the defense and leaked their vehicles by setting a road from a section left without a barricade.
Angry residents criticized the Solihull Council, saying it was "useless in solving the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They came there Monday evening after they sent stone from Bentley Heath to passersby.
The Council is embarrassed by their actions because they are useless to solve the problem.
Travelers were there when they were there in May, and now they came back.
Last night came more and more, probably more today. "
He added: 'The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it with the long suspension decisions taken to protect the parks.
I live on the streets of Streetsbrook, and I am not happy to continue paying the tax even if the council can not stop it. "
A region that does not want to give the name said: 'Like a joke, we saw that the last group of travelers had just left, and we were immediately destroyed by a new group.
The numbers were increased this time and it was even seen that a horse grazed in a park area. '
A woman spokesperson from the Solihull Council said: 'We are aware that there is an unauthorized camp on the streets of Streetsbrook Street, and we are starting the legal proceedings as soon as possible to send them from there.
In order to support our evidences, it is very important that any anti-social or criminal behavior is reported to the police by calling 101 of as many residents as possible.
This will help the case to reveal the picture for the court to consider when we present the case to the court. '

Last day's fuss!
Flocked to fire stations
Thousands of vehicles were damaged with the thunderstorm and hail that happened on Thursday in Istanbul.
Most of the drivers who reported from the firefighters reported that the damage was covered by the insurance companies, while the non-reported drivers entered the queue for the report.
Today, the drivers who are casked and not reported, came to the fire stations and asked for a report because it was the last day of this notification period.
Today is the last day
The drivers took photographs of their vehicles to the firefighters to determine the damage of their vehicles.
The drivers whose damage was detected were then reported to the officers.
Hasan Erol, who came to the fire station for the report, said, "I will register and photograph."
There was intensity when I came.
"There was damage to the windshield," he said.
Driver Erbil Kılıç, "Coştura came to rush."
We came to the queue.
We took the photo.
"Now we will wait for the report."
Skyscrapers with sea and land walls do not breathe
Parliamentary Member of the CHP, Nadir Ataman, found in the earthquake warning about the giant structures rising on the shore, said: "The report of the expert in Davad says that these buildings will not survive depression at the intensity of 6".
It is stated that the stakes, which are 25-30 meters below the solid rock, are not excavated so deeply.
Istanbul Atakoy high-rise hotels and residences that left the walls between the sea and the land left the city without breathing.
CHP Bakirkoy Municipal Assembly Member Nadir Ataman reacted to the giant shopping mall, hotel and residence projects, one of which rises behind him.
Attracting attention to the winds of coastal structures, Ataman said, "80 years ago, those who planned according to the wind created the Atatürk Forest in Florya.
After 80 years, when the point of understanding of urbanism was reached, huge skyscrapers stood on the wind corridors and changed the climate.
"He's not breathing in the county," he said.
As Ataköy beach, rising walls like the climate has changed the balance of the buildings that Ataman said: "Because of skyscrapers, the temperature is 10 degrees more felt."
These buildings must be built according to the direction of the winds.
But our skyscrapers rise above the wind corridors of Istanbul.
The wind can not get into the syllable.
These constructions undermine the natural life balance.
Ataman stated that these skyscrapers, which harm the environment and human health, also cut the connection of the Bakırköy people with the sea and said that they would apply to the Board of the Memorials on the subject and go to the judiciary.
Non-surgical treatment is possible at the turn of the head.
Phenol application is seen in 83 percent of success cases.
In this method, the diseased tissue is effectively cleansed and the tissue void is filled with an agent that kills the hair follicles.
Another method of non-surgical hair replacement treatment is the laser method.
With various lasers, the hair follicles and the surrounding tissue are burned by the circular radiant rays, and during the burning, the tissues are clogged.
Thanks to these two non-surgical methods of gynecological disease, patients can return to social and business life in a shorter time.
Dr. Mert Atak, who stated that excessive weight, immobilization, long sitting, doing intensive hair and body shaving and not wearing hygiene rules, caused symptoms such as pain, infection, abscess and swelling in his tail.
Italy hardens CSOs' approach to migratory rescue boats
Italy, the NGOs that operate migratory rescue boats in the Mediterranean have warned that they will not be allowed to continue if they do not comply with the new rules affecting their operations.
"If NGOs do not fit the new rules, it will be hard to see that they continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti told the Turin newspaper La Stampa in an interview.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities confiscated a boat operated by the German charity Jugend Rettet, apparently cooperating effectively with human traffickers in a way that would facilitate their illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has been active for only one year, has refused to comment on the content of detailed charges against Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
The organization said in a statement in social media: "For us, the saving of human life is and will be our most important priority, so we are very sorry that we can not work in the search and rescue area right now."
"We can only do an assessment of the accusations being made at the moment after we have collected all the information and have made the assessment of the situation."
The Italian authorities have been watching Jugend Rettet's boat Iuventa since October.
It is suspected that the crew has taken them to the refugee boat full of rubber boots delivered directly by human traffickers and allowed the smugglers to flee to the boat for reuse.
According to the files of the prosecutor's office published by the Italian media, at least such a meeting was held at 1.3 mph on the Libyan coast.
The crew is suspected of ignoring the authority of the Italian coast guard, who oversaw rescue operations in the area due to humanitarian efforts for another purpose.
According to the statute, it was supposed to be an Italian police officer who clearly observed their activities on the deck of the boats like Iuventa.
Only three of the nine CSOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the rules: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
Last Tuesday, he said that he considered new rules unnecessary but acceptable because it would not cause any "serious change or hindrance" to his rescue operations.
Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders (MSF) is also among those who refuse to sign.
Minniti, meanwhile, said that the sharp decline in the number of immigrants coming to Italy following last week's salvation, the efforts to strengthen Libya's coastal security and the cooperation with local governors are fruitful.
The minister said: "In recent days we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel."
This month announced plans with Libyan governors for further talks on economic development initiatives and measures to reduce the number of immigrants who have left Chad, Niger and Mali and those countries hoping to reach Europe.
Last minute fist!
Russia's capital city was drinking vodka, watermelon, as it was every year in the "paratroopers day" celebrations in Moscow.
Russian NTV television, who participated in the event and made a live broadcast in a Russian Gorki Park, was attacked by reporter Nikita Razvozjayev.
The reporter who reported the developments of the day in the live broadcast warned the man who shouted "We will seize the Ukraine" by saying, "Please shut up".
The drunk man, who was said to be an old parachutist, threw a hard punch at him on the reporter's warning.
The reporter, who was stunned by the blow of his fist, tried to get away from the man.
Millions of people watched the shock in a live broadcast.
Economy Coordination Board convened
The Economic Coordination Board (EKK) was convened under the chairmanship of Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek.
Following the cabinet change made by the ruler, the first meeting of the EKK meeting in Şimşek presidency started at 18.30 in Çankaya Mansion.
The macroeconomic picture of Turkey will be discussed at the meeting.
The meeting under the chairmanship of Şimşek was attended by Minister of Finance Naci Ağbal, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Labor and Social Security Jülide Sarıeroğlu, Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci, Minister of Development Lütfi Elvan, Undersecretary Osman Çelik, Central Bank President Murat Çetinkaya and related bureaucrats.
It is possible to get rid of the waist hole in 45 minutes
Dr. Oğuz Karaeminoğulları emphasized that only 5 percent of the patients should be operated on in the treatment of waist failure. "The first step according to the patient's examination and imaging results is rest and drug treatment".
Oğuz Karaeminoğulları stated that interventional methods (epidural injection, radiofrequency techniques, intra-disc interventions) should be tried in the patient group in which the pain continues. Especially if all of these methods can not be achieved, if the drowsiness and weakness in the legs become obvious, then the operation becomes obligatory.
Karaeminoğulları explains that it is possible to get rid of the belly disease in 45 minutes by expressing that the 'closed closed belly surgery', which is the most dangerous nowadays, allows the patients who can not get results with the interventional methods to decrease the drawbacks of the surgery.
Although microscopic surgery can yield very good results compared to open surgery, some complications such as long recovery period, adhesion to the spinal cord, recurrence of the heel, future back shift and infection may be encountered after the operation.
In most cases, microscopic surgery is defined as 'closed surgery', but microscopic surgery is performed with the same approach as open surgery.
In the case of fully closed belly surgery, these risks are rising because the surrounding tissues are protected.
Fully closed belly surgery only takes 45 minutes.
Special commission at work
CHP deputies Mehmet Gökdağ, Cemal Okan Yuksel, Baris Yarkadaş and High Disciplinary Board Member Turan Aydoğan will take part in the committee.
Commission, Berberoğlu'nun on October 4 Istanbul 14.
He will also follow the applications made to the Constitutional Court and the District Court of Appeals by the hearing in the High Criminal Court.
CHP Secretary General Kamil Okyay Sındır and Deputy Chairman Bülent Tezcan signed the signing of the commission, "Judicial independence and impartiality, apart from law to take orders from anywhere except the justice is indispensable condition."
"Our deputy, Mr. Enis Berberoglu, was asked to protect his belief in independence and neutrality of the judiciary, who did not demand any special status when he was a member of parliament, did not take refuge in the immunity he recognized by his deputies," he said.
It is argued that the judging process prefers to practice political orders instead of judging the court.
It was argued in the letter that the Constitutional Court's decision to arrest the members of the parliament was wrong, but that the decision to arrest him before the judgment was finalized was a clear proof that the judge had taken the decision under his influence.
Michelle Carter was sentenced for messages encouraging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend to commit suicide through messages and phone calls.
At the moment, Michelle Carter, who is 20 years old, will pay 15 months behind bars and five years as a legitimate evacuation.
On July 13, 2014, Carter was convicted of the death of Conrad Roy, who had been killed in his own life.
Mr. Roy's father spoke on Thursday's session: "My family's heart is broken.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free on the road to appeal.
Although he faced a maximum of 20 years in custody, his law team argued that he and Mr. Roy suffer from mental illness.
Carter, wearing a red blouse with a pair of pants and a creamy color, was tortured while his elderly eyes, his hands and his eyes gazed at him.
The prosecutor said to the court, "His actions killed Conrad Roy."
He ended his life to heal his own.
He did not accept responsibility. "
"He never showed you regret."
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was a horrible situation in which he completely regretted it."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not see his "age, maturity level, or even the mental illness" making any significant impact on his actions.
A prosecutor, Mr. Roy's mother, read a statement by Lynn Roy: "One day I will not mourn for the loss of my beloved son.
I want to be proud of me and how I come from above everything, I am going to be carrying it forever, and I am trying to be with all my sisters in pain. "
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, gave the statement that his brother could never attend his wedding or that his reality could never have happened to his children.
"It's a pain that will always be with me in the rest of my life because that person who's ever been with me ever since I was born," he said.
The case seems to create case law since there is no Massachusetts law that criminalizes a person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Mr. Roy was found dead in a car in a car monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The case attracted national interest as it revealed that Carter's text messages encouraged him to end his own life.
While she was on vacation with her family, she said in her many posts she had sent two weeks before her death: "Hush yourself, jump out of a car, knife yourself, I do not know, there are many ways."
Before his suicide, he wrote: "You must do this, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz ordered the press not to allow him to benefit from this case, saying that Carter wanted to attract attention through the death of Mr. Roy.
His legal opinions were dismissed.
There was Amanda Knox, who was guilty of murdering a British roommate in Italy in 2007, before the two minorities defended him.
Ms. Knox (30), in an outrageous opinion in the Los Angeles Times, wrote: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not imprisonment."
Striking growth forecast from Mehmet Simsek
In his statement, Şimşek stated that inflation in Turkey should fall to low single-digit figures and expressed that food inflation is a "risk area".
Deputy Prime Minister predicts that inflation will fall below 7 percent in 2018.
In his thunderbolt, he said:
Decreasing uncertainties is critical for the next 12 months.
The biggest incentive is to reduce uncertainties.
There is a strong government.
There is no political ambiguity.
I hope that the ambiguities in our immediate geography will also diminish.
By reforming a bit, we believe that by increasing our resistance to shocks, Turkey has a growth trend above 5 percent.
I told you months ago.
The worst was left behind.
Gradually we will no longer have to shift our energy to those areas, but to enrich our energy, to reforms that will ...
That's why it's critical for the next 12 months.
Reform from one side, uncertainties from the other have diminished, there is no political uncertainty anymore.
I hope our luck will go away and the distress in our near geography will be reduced.
Whether we like it or not, a lot of classic crooks have collapsed.
Libya, like Iraq.
We do not just lose Sunday we are faced with over 3.5 million waves of migration.
When we look at the last 15 years, Turkey has grown by 5.7 percent despite all these shocks.
Turkey, that is, we have strong problems in our bases.
Now, with some reforms, we have increased our resistance to shocks, further reducing the number of investors' question marks in the minds of investors and putting Turkey back on growth policy of over 5 percent.
I have to say that I have such a generous pension system from here.
I guess it would be reasonable to say that our pension companies did not make enough effort.
Once in auto attendance performance will be strong.
Why?
Because we took precautions.
Firms do not have to go and make effort and make expense.
Taking these concerns into account, taking into consideration that performance is weak, we have worked on how to allocate global assets to which investment areas.
You know the deposits are high on the returns.
In addition to the 25 percent that the state will give, there will be a performance there.
In addition to the treasury papers that remain, there is usually a low risk.
When we look at the big picture, I think it will be interesting in the coming period.
Because they will see performance.
The other area is not a failure but success.
We have restructured the 2013 BES.
There are 6.8 million participants, I have an accumulation of 70 billion pounds.
Give me the right system.
There are 2.6 million participants in automatic attendance, and there is accumulation of 775 million pounds.
We want a little more effort from the companies.
If they make a little ad, they explain this system.
We're working on a retreat.
Maybe if we flex her a little ...
We look, we work.
Perhaps the citizens will see and accumulate visibility and stay in the system.
38 percent from the system.
Almost half of the divorces are voluntary individual pensioners.
You do not want two individual pension accounts.
What are you doing?
You are coming out of auto attendance.
We were actually expecting a cessation of around 10 percent.
There also means that we are very optimistic.
Once the system is running.
We brought a prime ceiling.
Insurance companies sometimes unilaterally disclose.
They have increased their premiums very quickly.
When we ask what is happening, judicial decisions do not take into account the current regulations.
We made new net editing.
We told you to do your thing.
They said no, we should wait for the judge.
We say that this is not the case.
We have an idea here.
Of course, some firms are caught in the application of this ceiling premium.
We made a new arrangement.
We created a risky insurer pool.
I tell you, I repeat.
I prefer to operate this system through competition.
So I do not find these ceiling price applications right, they forced us to.
I would like to see this in three dimensions.
Take into account the system we have built.
Two, the system works normally, it's a pricing on that track.
In addition to it, the loads are heavy, almost 30-31 lira of tax deducted every 100 liras paid to SGK.
I'm working here too, and we'll talk to our finance minister.
Third, technology is developing rapidly.
Now, with time, traffic accidents will be severely reduced structurally.
But this is compulsory traffic insurance.
SABAH "saved the cuff in the head
Buerger's disease, which emerged from adolescence, was a discomfort in men in the past, but it is now common in women as well.
One of these women is Mehtap Dursun, 36 years old.
The pain started two years ago became chronic on the soles of the feet.
The young woman who was struggling to walk was hospitalized when she was faced with the risk of losing her bacon.
A friend Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko suggested.
SABAH'da headline 'Azerbaijan Minister of Emergency Situations saved the life' showed the news.
It turned out that Dursun, who went to Kalko, was struggling with Buerger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko, the young woman took urgent action.
Shortly after his pain relief, Dursun now sees oxygen treatment.
Audi 850.000 Diesel Vehicle Modifiye Edecek Against Automobile Manufacturers Adverse Reaction
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said he believes the company "is more intelligent options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is headquartered (considering banning or limiting diesel vehicles).
Daimler said on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be modified to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies described these actions as recalls.
European carmakers have intensified the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But nitrogen oxides released by diesel engines are considered cancer-causing and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment that automotive companies have to put in order to neutralize the dirty fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it harder for car prices to remain competitive.
While German carmakers were opposed to the review, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government was also accused of spoiling powerful automobile companies and ignoring the suspicions of the problem.
Firms are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes repeatedly, which hides the use of a device known as a deceptive device and adjusts the emissions to match the regulations when an automobile is being tested and relaxes it under normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen executives were charged in the US and others were under investigation at both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Audi's engine development department, the former president of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
The former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and therefore protected against criminal prosecution and can be tried in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was dragged into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, after the authorities blamed Audi for wearing a system to get rid of European emissions rules, then they extended the United States-based investigation.
Audi's involvement in the investigation may be heavy for Volkswagen: the luxury car maker has an overwhelming share of Volkswagen's profits.
Every time you see the fish jump
Prof. Dr. Yusuf Şükrü Çağlar, Head of the Turkish Neurosurgical Society, warned not to skip the fishermen to the shallow places for 2 meters, which are not sure deeply.
Every year thousands of people are at risk of paralysis due to neck fracture and spinal cord injury due to diving into shallow waters.
Neck fractures most commonly occur in 5 or 6 "nci vertebrae.
The characteristic of fractures is that it affects the nerves feeding the muscles of the respiratory muscles as well as the arms and leg muscles.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar, "In this type of accident, our most valuable organ, the neck spinal cord, is cut by the fractured spine or it is compressed and becomes out of function."
"Incorrect first aid for spinal cord injuries is not enough to increase the damage in the casualties and can lead to death," he said.
Diving into the water is fourth in spinal cord injuries.
The average age of the injured is 20-29 and the majority are male.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar, "Invisible water fishery should not be skipped."
"The better you get your diving, the worse you'll get is a serious injury," he said.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar also reminded:
Depending on the level of spinal cord at which the injury causes injury, the paralysis may occur at different levels on the arms and legs.
You may know swimming but water can be deceiving.
The place that seems deep to you may be shallow.
In the US and Australia, the warning plates placed on the seashore showed a 70 percent reduction in shallow water fishing jumps.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar, "Despite the fact that 28 provinces in Turkey have coast to coast, unfortunately there is not a single warning sign in places outside Istanbul."
"Regarding this kind of accidents, which are darkening life, every pre-summer health directorate, schools and social awareness project need to have a noticeable information light or information panels in the seas and pools," he said.
Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, President of the Spinal and Peripheral Nerve Surgery Group of the Turkish Neurosurgical Society, suggested that the following should be done in case of injury:
At the time of the incident, 112 jobs were the first job.
The neck should be kept as stable as possible, should not be moved, should be fixed with a hard collar.
The airway should be provided and the patient should be placed on the opposite side for drainage of the run-off water.
It should not be hanged to catch the floodlights and drain the water.
Do not attempt to correct the malformation of the neck of the patient.
The neck vertebrae may have been broken.
However, if the spinal cord has not yet been damaged, an inappropriate position for first aid and delivery of the patient during the transport of the patient may cause broken bone fragments to press on the spinal cord and cause it to cut and damage.
Provence lavender is under threat of climate change
It turned into a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is under the threat of climate change.
Lavender is dying because of drought-like conditions and disease-bearing insects, and this is causing a great headache to scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Irish research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to rain-induced climate change, much less in the spring and mostly in the autumn.
This is affecting the lavender's life.
There is also a small cicada with a leaf pest that transmits microbacteria, and it is very common in very dry weather. "
And many things are in danger.
Lavender oil for the perfume and cosmetics as well as holidaymaking is followed quite a bit.
Eric Chaisse said: "We have small, underdeveloped or non-existent or weak ears, while a few large flowers need to have very long plant ears.
So we have less essential oil fractions. "
Among the overhauled solutions include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but there is also a way to spray a protective slime and water mixture on the plants and develop more resistant species to dry conditions.
Journalist murder underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The weekly newspaper Riodoce's staff usually meets Wednesday to keep an eye on the latest chaos, corrupt officials and endless drug war wars scheduled for organizing in the state of Sinaloa.
But on this day, they came together to talk about their security in the shadow of their tragedy.
They told them it was important to change their routine.
Two senior journalists talk about what makes them feel safer: bringing their children together with them in 2009, the goal of a hand grenade, or leaving them at home.
The security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: the enemies, the neutralists, the allies.
Reporters want names for each column, no need for blood, perceptions and inner voices are enough.
Journalists suspected of drug traffickers, politicians, business people, government or cartoons paying salary, a list of Mexican villains who make the job of writing newspapers dangerous.
At least 25 people have been federally guarded since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 of them are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and at least seven of the seven provinces have so far been killed this year, according to the Journalists Protection Committee, as the number of corpses increases nationwide.
Among the last deceased are writers and inspiration sources Javier Valdez Cardenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist," Valdez writes in one of many books on narcotic violence.
His absence is felt deeply, but his presence is everywhere, with a big picture of Valdez showing his middle finger, "Justice" spoken on the front of Riodoce's building, with the two reporters of the 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wearing his shirts, his goggles face and the t-
The workshop takes place two months after his death, and reporters talk about common traumas, nightmares, insomnia, paranoids.
Despite the fact that in 2010 a special federal prosecutor's office was set up to deal with journalistic cases, according to the Journalism Protection Committee, only two have been prosecuted.
The killings of journalists are seldom enacted as drug trafficking and organizing suicide every year are the majority of thousands of murders.
In Riodoce they insist on referring to the violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken, even though the ground is now more deceptive.
Without knowing about the killers, without justice, it would be of little use to discuss security, says Ibarra.
"It's stupid to waste time at this workshop," he says.
"As long as we do not know why, you do not trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15th, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the provincial capital Culiacan.
The Red Toyota Corolla could only last a few blocks before being stopped by two men, forcibly removed from it, and shot 12 times for the name of the newspaper, supposedly translated as the Twelfth River.
The armed man ran away in his car and hit the car soon.
Valdez was 50 years old.
His wife and two adult children remained.
Gossip in Culiacan tends to move freely.
But about Valdez, there is nothing but silence.
It was one of the bloody battlefields of Sinaloa's country, when Guzman was arrested last year and after rival groups fought to fill the void after the US recall in January.
In Sinaloa, forbid the streets to be hit and killed by one or many people each day, or the cemetery of drug cousins full of ornate, two-storey, larger mosques than many houses to live in.
For a moment, forget about the "calmness" of controlling only one cartel's valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite this, and despite being deeply aware of the dangers of Valdez's work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, was demolished from guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes that the two errands have contributed to the murder.
First, there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, one of the rival cartel groups in battle with the sons of Guzman in a February issue.
This article may have annoyed his sons, the possible gang members, every copy of the pressure distributed to the newspaper franchisees, the distributors bought it.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after another newspaper was seized with the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and his murder was seen as a violent turning point of Mexican origin against journalists.
He had lived for a very long time, friends and colleagues always assumed to be there.
An experienced journalist at Noroeste in 2013 when he joined five business colleagues selling REDoce's $ 50 in shares.
"It was impossible in Sinaloa to journalize without mentioning narcotics," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper gained fame with bold and honest news, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved publishing crucial investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were caught up in a broadcast where no one could read the stories they dared not to communicate.
Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for journalism in Latin America eight years after its establishment.
In the same year, Valdez won the Journalism Protection Committee's International Press Freedom Award for showing the courage to leave the rest of the Mexican story based on where the Mexican narrative was based.
He accepted that you were clearly frightened.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to continue living."
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, drug trafficking in Sinaloa was a "lifestyle".
"As a journalist, you have to accept the task that you are falling in. You either play this or you are stupid.
I do not want you to be asked, 'What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why did you tell me what was going on?'
Riodoce personally misses Valdez, a cursing joke like a porter, his friends who are generous in embracing and advising, the teachers who know how to survive ...
They are safe for his routine.
He always took his hat.
He went to the office called El Guayabo and sat at the same table all the time.
Now they ask: Has the love of his routines collapsed?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and survive.
"If you deal with the secret airplanes they use to transport drugs, with their women, children, clean work, this does not go to their likes."
Bojorquez said, "These things have crossed the border."
The result was a high degree of self-defense and self-protection even at the best of times.
To rely on your own instincts.
If bad odors are coming, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, Riodoce editor-in-chief, said, "It is a smell-dangling sensation ... and what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules do not apply in Sinaloa, as they are not valid in the same provinces that are home to the same Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and the poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling roots, weak institutions and corrupt government officials ...
The ground is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce staff has met for safety training, and it was revealed days ago that spyware sold solely to governments was used to guard journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers wanted to get rid of a tree in the shadow of a 104 degree (40 Celsius) temperature.
They were assigned by the provincial government to protect Riodoce's office, a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood in Culiacan.
The half-sister was half-serious, some of the reporters wondering if these officers were from the cops in the 50 percent that the governor himself said was untrustworthy.
The reporters were the mountainous countryside cut-off months actually controlled by the drug gangs.
This week, Riodoce explores three main stories.
The brother of former great boxer Julio Cesar Chavez had a murder in Sinaloa.
In addition, government spending concentrated on Valin's country.
And a block away from the prosecutor's office had a group kidnapped at Culiacan's most expensive restaurant.
There was no official explanation as to who was kidnapped or how, so when it came time for everyone in the city to know what it was like to take care of it: the restaurant was both in the eyes of drug smugglers and authorities.
A reporter learned from official records that the restaurant is registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Corporate Revolutionary Party (PRI), who dominates almost every stage of last century's politics.
Lately, many PRI governors have been accused of corruption in sensational events.
Villareal asked the reporter to write at the scene about one of the sons of "El Chapo" Guzman, about the events that happened earlier, including the escape from a soldier raid.
They read only four months ago, looking at Valdez's corner for information provided by the best source of kidnappings.
Villareal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of its fine structure, said, "We already know what the precedence is."
"At this point all our communication channels with our sources have been cut off."
As the staff transformed into something that they never expected, activists on behalf of the press, Valdez's office is being reused as a repository for banners and protests against journalist murders.
Correspondent Miriam Ramirez clapped several banners and showed up for another journalist at the local prosecutor's office the following morning.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was murdered in the western Michoacan province.
There was a burned corpse, and according to DNA tests, official officials say it was him.
Reporters around the country are expressing their thoughts with a louder voice by writing "Help on the Basis" to pavements and buildings in organized protests.
Today director Bojorquez is trying to provide international support for justice in Washington, far away in Valdez.
Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth, when Valdez was killed at a meeting with the Valleys of Sinaloa.
After that day, he wanted to be appointed a different relative to the news of the government, thinking that he had damaged the neutrality of the anger.
Valdez has consistently said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organizing crime, accomplice officials and an unconcerned society.
In his last book, "Narko-journalism," he wrote that journalists are killed not only by drug gangs, but by the orders of politicians and security forces co-operating with organized crime.
The media observer group Articulo 19 attributed most of the attacks on journalists last year to police and official officials.
"You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez said.
The murders clearly had a cold shower effect.
Nobody is forgetting the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border province of Tamaulipas six years ago.
The Cesedi was accompanied by a note that was signed by the Zetas cartel: "I am here because of my news."
A computer keyboard and earpiece are laid next to the torn head.
After the murder of reporter Miroslava Breach in the northern border province of Chihuahua in March, some publications like El Norte chose to close.
Following the murders of their principals in 2004, others, such as El Manana from Nuevo Laredo, continue.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke to the drug cartoons with the following headline on the front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists escape from their own provinces, even from the country.
It's a shabby decision.
It is difficult to find jobs on the run and they are still scanning the streets in anticipation of danger.
Sometimes the photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was massacred in an apartment in Mexico City together with four women in 2015 three months after her disappearance from Veracruz, is seized as an agreement.
A dance made every day with these high-risk decisions for those who stay behind and work.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says he scared himself of reporting on the drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell and I am the reporter for this reason."
Around midnight Saturday, when the final count was being prepared, Riodoce writers began to steal the phone at the same time as sitting on the sidewalk outside the office and having a beer.
A series of armed conflicts involving rival gangs and security forces near Mazatlan, a holiday resort on the beach, have caused 19 confirmed deaths.
As promised in a series of cartel messages in the environment, the war continued to heat up.
They put it on the website of Riodoce via mobile phones on the sidewalk.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
The sirens have begun to mourn recently, there is a conflict with another weapon in the vicinity.
Bojorquez glanced quickly at police officers on guard to see if they were on alert.
Even if they were afraid, they would not show it.
Under the enormous portraits of the defeated founders of his newspapers, his middle finger was on display for the whole Sinaloa's sight, and Riodoce's staff was following his footsteps.
"How can you think about closing," Bojorquez said, "on the day that Javier was killed, while the trainee did not send him out to make news on the street?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a sculpture, but to a horrible one.
The researchers now know that the first findings of an incredible creation of rhino-sized creatures found by a Canadian miner are well preserved, and experts have described it as' the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
They were so well preserved that they could tell that the flaky skin was reddish brown and say it was a 'troubled past'.
The report in Current Biology described it as 'one of the best preserved armored dinosaurs and one of the best dinosaur species in the world'.
The fossil is a newly discovered nodozoa that lived 110 million to 112 million years from the middle of the Cretaceous Period.
The extraordinarily well-preserved situation has amazed researchers who have defined it as 'truly wonderful'.
Plant-eating armored, according to National Geographic reports, is the best kept fossil of its kind.
Shawn Funk found the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta Canada on March 21, 2011.
He hit something strange about the rock around him and decided to look closer.
The fossil unearthed was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
For the next 6 years, they ran wild animals out of a 2500 pound (1100 kg) soil pile.
After this intense work, the completed result is now ready to be revealed.
Caleb Brown, a science fellow at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is exhibited, said, 'If you make your eyes a bit short, you can even believe that you are almost asleep.'
'Science is one of the most beautiful of its history and will be passed down as the best preserved dinosaur species, the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
The researchers, examining the skin, found that even though it was covered with armor and resembled a walking tank, the plant was facing a serious threat from eating dinosaurs, probably from meat-eating dinosaurs.
The rather heavy armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from the tear and used a protective technique used by many modern animals known as contra-shading.
Experts say they are hunted by larger dinosaurs, saying it allows them to get around better and get their enemies over.
The 110-million-year-old nodosaur family first appeared in the headlines in May and is now exhibited at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The researchers have now finished their work and gave the name of the wild animal, Borealopelta markmitchelli, who is dedicated to the museum technician Mark Mitchell, who is one of the team who spent more than 7000 hours effortlessly to uncover it.
The extraordinary preservation of the tread made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the stamps and the armor documentation on the body.
Contra-shadowing is discovered, which means that it is a common defense method in the animal kingdom and that the upper part of the creature is darker at the bottom.
Contra-shading is common, but the findings are surprising because the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the contra-shaded animals that are alive today.
This means that dinosaurs have been hunted by meat-eating dinosaurs as vigorously as they have been, and that evolution also wants to face hiding as a way of survival.
But the most contemporary animals (such as deer, zebras, or armadillos) that use contra-shadowing are much smaller and much more vulnerable to being a prey, meaning that this nodozer has faced a serious challenge to survive.
"The powerful hunting of a huge, heavy armored animal shows how dangerous the dinosaur tearl in the Cretaceous is," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the flakes also revealed that the dinosaur skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about their life, including protected intestinal contents, to find out what they ate at their last meal.
They believe that when a dinosaur dies, he falls into a river and drifts into the sea, where he sinks over the surface of the ocean on his back.
At that time, Alberta was as hot as South Florida today, and probably more than it is now, with rivers and oceans now.
"The nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is covered and preserved entirely in the sculpture, while at the same time the animal's original shape has been preserved in 3D," Brown said.
'The result is that the animal looks almost identical today as it looks in the early Cretaceous.
You do not need a lot of imagination to rebuild it, if you keep your eyes a bit short, you can even believe that you are almost asleep. '
Cretaceous, giant teropods with meaty gluttonous dinosaurs standing on two legs when they were on the globe.
Although he was king of all, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armored dinosaur Borealopelta, which could have been hunted by a number of imposing ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, 6-tonne monster.
Scientists in their latest findings, Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta is dragged into the sea after death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, digging the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur, including leather and armor, complete from the horn to the hips.
The creature weighs about 18 ft. (Five meters) on average and weighs up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
There are two 20-inch long horns coming out of their shoulders.
The researchers believe that this armored weed wandered into the open sea by a river overflowing, and now wandering around in western Canada is cumbersome.
But the dinosaur kept the grave under the sea in perfect detail.
This special fossilized remains are so well preserved that the skin pieces still cover the bumpy armor layers along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, a housing at this level is as rare as "piyango".
The more I look at her, the more incredible she is.
Fossilized skin pieces still cover the bumpy armor layers that dot the dinosaur skull.

Do not be whitening your teeth
White teeth and an aesthetic smile are every man's dream.
While people resort to all sorts of ways to whiten their teeth, Nükhet Berk, President of Oral Laser Practices Association, warns that products that are sold in the market or on the internet should be avoided.
"The bleaching of the teeth can be achieved by fine porcelain surfaces adhering to the surface of the teeth or the chemical substances applied by the dentists," says Nükhet Berk, who points out that these materials sold the surface of the enamel and that the teeth were colored without any recycling.
Bearing in mind that the protection of dental health prevents many diseases from occurring and that aesthetic practices are also important in terms of mental health by giving teeth and gum health as well as a nice smile, Berk shares the following information:
As long as there are no abnormalities or genetic factors in the tooth structures, the teeth of the young people are usually white.
The teeth get darker over the years due to aging, scrawling of dental minerals and frequent consumption of cigarettes, abrasive or dark colored drinks.
Bleaching of teeth can be achieved by fine chemicals applied by dentists or by fine porcelain surfaces which adhere to the surface of the teeth with minimal or no abrasion, such as a false nail.
Products never sold in the market or on the internet should not bleach your teeth.
Because these substances burn the surface of the enamel, the teeth are colored so that there is no recycling.
Kecioren Municipality, 2011 "to this side of the elderly, handicapped and bedridden citizens" Domestic Tooth and Oral Health Care "gives.
Köksal Güngör, 65 years old, who has been living in a bedrocked life for 24 years in the Awakening Quarter of Keçiören, said: "My wife has been informed of this service of Keçiören Municipality."
We sought the municipality, they came immediately.
"I already paralyzed the neck down, I do not neglect my dental care if not at all thanks to this service."
Gülizar Taşçıoğlu, a 95-year-old living in the Pınarbaşı neighborhood, is 72 years old daughter of Kezban Gökçe, "My parents are living in bed for 7.5 years because of old age."
When I came to the municipality, I saw the banners of this service and immediately called.
We have been receiving this service regularly for 4 years.
I also have problems with my teeth, the doctors are looking at me when they come.

"Seniority" in Turkish army
Dear readers, very interesting decisions were taken especially at the meeting of the High Military Council (YAŞ) held on the previous day in terms of Naval Forces.
The commander of this Force was not an admiral, but a coroner.
It is an application that has never been seen before in our army.
How did this happen?
Admiral Bülent Bostanoğlu, the Commander of the Force, has completed his term and will retire already ...
And it happened.
Now the commanding order came to Veysel Kösele, the only admiral.
In the past, Veysel Pasha, who had been a disgruntled victim and who had been detained for a while, had to be a commander in normal order of rank.
But the government did not want it.
I try to summarize it very briefly, commanders 1, 3, 4 and 5 were not promoted at the top of the Navy.
In this case, the Marine Corps was the only admiral.
The vacant bureau was supposed to be brought in: Admiral Veysel Kösele, Commander of the Navy at number two.
What happened after that?
Vice Admiral Ozbal, who was in sixth place, was appointed by the government.
Now look at this table!
Admiral Veysel Kösele stands there, but a lower-ranking commander is appointed instead!
A senior, junior emrine is getting sick.
What will happen next?
An admiral who is superior to the rank can not do the task at the command of a lieutenant who is himself a junior.
He can not take orders from him, he can not.
In this case, Veysel Kösele will not endure this hurtful situation. If the retirement is not sent, he will resign today or tomorrow.
This is the hurtful message given to him by the government anyway: "Veysel Pasha with all your heart!"
Yesterday I wrote this article, but after the announcement, the news resigned at the end of the day, but the situation has yet to be officially announced.
Now let's look at these again!
The government objected to Veysel Kösele for this or that reason, did not want to, forced it to resign and replaced the command with a sixth corridor instead of the army and destroyed the traditional "Seniority" mentality.
There is always politics in the work, but we do not know the background behind the scenes.
Maybe if we tell somebody soon we'll all learn together!
Dear readers, I have tried to explain briefly above, especially the seniority in the Turkish army is very important.
Not just as a rank.
For example, the officer who finished the 10th place in the Military School is more senior than the 11th.
The general is promoted from the first rank, the second rank is more senior than promoted.
We experienced concrete examples of this seniority event in the War of Independence.
Garp Front Commander Ismet Pasha ...
You have two armies under your command.
Army and 2nd Army.
By 1922, our armies would carry out a great assault and expel the Greek army.
At this stage there are valuable names expected to be assigned to the army command.
One is Refet (Bele) Pasha.
An army commander is offered to him, but he says "Ismet benden is junior, I can not enter his emrine".
Another name is Yakup Şevki (Subaşı) Pasha.
His teacher at Atatürk's War Academy ...
A valued and veteran commander who loved, valued, addressed as "my teacher", and was involved in various wars.
In 1919, he was caught with soldiers and civilian Turkish intellectuals and driven by the British to the island of Malta.
On his return to homeland he is reluctant about the military command and says the same thing: "The commander of the West Front is me senior, I can not take orders from him".
However, Atatürk persuades him to ask for gratitude and Yakup Şevki Pasha accepts the command of one of the two armies.
The third is a very colorful name ...
Ali Ihsan (Sabis) Pasha.
He speaks so much, he's always a soldier.
A commander who fought in Iraq, Caucasus, Iran and various fronts.
He is exiled by the British to Malta, escapes from there and comes to Ankara via Kuşadası.
When the army command is offered to him, Ali Ihsan Pasha says the same thing: "I can not fight at the command of Ismet, who is a junior ..."
But it is being persuaded ...
But it seems that the point is that since the beginning of the relativity, emrine has been constantly arguing with the Garp Front Commander Ismet Pasha, making the incident and making the army uneasy ...
And in a major offensive, a short time ago, the officer was transferred from the post and a retirement was introduced, replaced by a bearded Nurettin Pasha.
After that Ali Ihsan Paşan'ın Atatürk'le never improves.
The issue of seniority in the Turkish army is not only in war, but also in peace.
Of course he has to go out.
Veysel Kösele is the last example of this.
An activist had to learn the answer of the question "Who are the streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken deeply.
One day after arriving to New York City, St. Louis's native sat in the bed of the Airbnb hired and started on Facebook on his phone.
It came to the sharing of a librarian.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still on the street."
I was surprised to discover that no one else shared this information in the content stream, turned off Facebook and turned on Twitter.
A user @TheePharoah nickname was constantly re-tweeted in the content stream.
The rapper from the St. Louis region tweeted Michael Brown's death vividly, an 18-year-old, unarmed black, murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson Missouri.
He shared the photograph of Brown's street-sized body, which will remain there for four hours.
Ferrell thought to himself, "This is brutal."
But death was not new to him or to society.
The phone then left to return to tweets about people gathering at Canfield Drive that same evening.
There were photographs of a man holding a banner on the police bands, shouting people and claiming to be Brown's father, saying "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
A police officer watched a live broadcast with a dog hawk in front of a group of protesters.
Another policeman on another video, as he said, triggered his rifle and yelled: "The animals I will kill all of you."
Ferrell recalled, "This is not customary."
"'This is the kind we are used to, and it is not a typical murder we can say.'
I felt a creep at that.
I'm angry and crying. "
He booked a return ticket and went home the next day.
At 11 pm, he took the 6 year old from his father's house and decided to go to Ferguson with him the next morning.
What will happen to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is a new documentary titled "Who Are the Streets?".
This is a story telling from the point of view of the people who survive and protest, love and loss, power and resistance, who live in that society and fill the streets with the answers they seek.
When Ferrell drove his car to Ferguson with his daughter wearing a floral dress and wearing a crown, he returned to talk about the "experiences of the politicians and the situation of the politicians" that they had repeatedly done that morning.
"Do you remember that I taught you that black people should fight for what they believe?"
"Right now we go to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old child and that was not true.
I could not have taken him, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened here today ... is a result of what happened in the past.
He must know, must see, and grow up within.
We should not only develop well in the field of activism and organizing, but also know the layers of the black experience and the black situation, and knowing what we should do to liberate ourselves.
I will not be any different from any black woman-child, if I am lucky enough to give her an experience she will not personally experience in racial racism.
I feel like I will be doing evil by protecting him from them. "
Their first stop in Ferguson was on the South Florissant Highway, across the police headquarters, which turned officer Darren Wilson into a kind of camp site for activists, who later awaited to talk about the matter that resulted in no criminal charges.
There Ferrell and her daughter contacted local business owners who prepared packaged food.
The bags were made and they helped to get them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism was gradually being formed.
"My activism was fully transformed after August 9," said a student at the Missouri State University, who is president of the Minority Students Nurses Association and concentrates on injustice in food justice and health in the black community.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It came spontaneously. "
After a few weeks, Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, one of Filmin's co-directors, at an evening show.
Folayan said that he and his own image director Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.
Ferrell's mind came up with a question: "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story you can use?"
This skepticism has been reported by countless people, usually whites, to come from a gathering and to benefit from its pain and resistance ...
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We heard that the sounds of people born and raised in Ferguson were not condensed, and we decided to do it differently."
Folayan had already contacted local actor Damon Davis, known for his activism in connection with the death sentence prisoners.
His involvement warmed Ferrell to the project, as well as the rest of the six other regions, following "The Who's on the Streets" team in the years after Brown hit him.
David said: "This documentary is not one of us talking or talking to us, we are talking."
"What was essential for me was how these people would be represented, because that's how I will be represented."
"While the aim is not to focus on Ferrell's experience, he said," the film proved that the participants were the most open, "as the movement showed that" it is not about a Christian leader, the community is about to come together. "
As a result, "The Streets Whose Who?" Surprisingly documents the personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as being in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like a nude," said Ferrell, who laughed at the finished product for the first time.
"But when I was doing this, and I was humanizing black people, I knew there might be some sensitivity."
In addition, Ferrell's story consolidates the role of black gay lesbians in the Black Lives Matter movement and re-centers them.
After the murder of black teen Trayvon Martin in 2012, two of the three founders, who derive the #BlackLivesMatter slogan in social media, describe themselves as homosexual.
"The black homosexual women in the lead generally keep the movement alive," said Ferrell, "and this is our constant battle on many fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all their weight. "
Folayan said: "The movement is really kept alive by black women and many homosexual black women."
Ferrell, however, insists that "this is not something of the sort of affirmative action" and that he is not elected because of his identity.
He says: "He was the one who took this energy action."
"But it is not a coincidence that he is in the forefront, because as a black gay woman you have a lot to lose by living a life at these intersections.
From the screen you can feel its energy. "
In the meantime, the news cams have already gone to Ferguson, but there are worrying racial links between the community and the police.
Ferrell is under surveillance for 2.5 years due to close the highway during a show.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere in the region of the house as "confusion" in one word.
Nevertheless, the song that he put on the streets of Ferguson keeps digging into his memory three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Winning is our job.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing more to lose than our chains. "
Kyrie Irving: The world is not round!
"The world is not round," Irving told NBC Sports.
The world is flat.
People are getting used to such things by providing fear.
Oh my friend, do not question it.
Because the more information you solve, the more information you get.
This is crazy.
The world is flat?
Or is it turning around roundly?
I think you should investigate this.
I tell you, they lie against face to face.
They are lying to us!
"I believe I have wanted to believe for years."
I thought the world was round and back.
Do you really think we're back in the solar system?
Nothing they send comes back.
He's not coming back!
The information they give us is inconsistent.
The truth is here.
You just have to look for this truth.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?"
Claiming that the world is flat, Kyrie Irving struggles with the Cleveland Cavaliers form this season with an average of 24.4 points and 5.9 assists.
A Relevant Similarity: The artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the room at the New York Fridman Gallery, there are many white, black and brown, almost vaguely resembling faces hanging over the cables in the back.
These 30 portrait artists were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg, ear rods and cut hair sent to him by Chelsea Manning.
Manning, a former intelligence analyst who has been known for stealing diplomatic messages for 35 years after wreaking havoc with the WikiLeaks site, has sent his cut hair out of Fort Leavenworth's prison.
The name of the new exhibition opened on August 2 is a generic similarity.
This is a product of Dewey-Hagborg, who combines discipline with technology in computer science and in-house expertise, and a two-year writer between Manning, a leading trans-woman and a trans-woman forgiven by three-day ban Barack Obama.
Dewey-Hagborg, who created 30 portraits by analyzing the DNA extracted from Manning in an algorithmic way and by using what he could have looked like, could produce not only the workability of the DNA data (the many ways that it could be interpreted and the determinism of the interpretation itself) but also a tight, perhaps somewhat cerebral interpretation.
Manning, born as Bradley Edward, but openly admitted to being a woman in her adolescence, Manning was convicted of sixteen offenses in 2013, six of them from computer espionage and vileness.
The image was put under pressure by the prison, so that there was only one photograph: the unsettled Manning's sitting in his driver's seat, a sandy, black-and-white graceful self-affirming platinum-yellow wig.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a success in 2012 with the enormous success of the Stranger Proactive.
In this, the artist produced portraits by filtering out DNA from the fragments of forensic pieces such as cigarette butts and gum to make a picture of what these people might look like.
He just received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were interviewing Chelsea Manning in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait that could accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained in the press preview of the new exhibition.
During this time he could not visit, his photograph could not be taken, he reached Chelsea and asked if he was interested in making a DNA portraiture.
The artist and his imprisoned inspiration became unexpected letter mates by exchanging many letters over a period of two years.
They even revealed Suppressed Images, a cartoon book that was illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, in which the president forgives Chelsea's punishment and dreams of a future that he can personally view the exhibition.
Obama is really asking for Manning's release a few days after he went to the book market, a kind of happy coincidence after seven cruel years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something profound and powerful about this exhibition, which is now open, while Donald Trump has tweeting information about the government and waging war on transgender soldiers, and there are new, tweeterable ways to foster even the sharp divisions that he wants to repair.
When all of this is asked about the strange timing, Dewey-Hagborg said, "Things happen for a reason."
An artist's statement on the wall of the gallery was calling for an end to "automatic discrimination based on sex, race, sexuality and culture" (Manning's big-size signature, under his signature "i", "harping point heart").
In front of the wall is his mitochondrial DNA sequence: many C's, G's and A's written in lead pencil ...
Including 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the sophisticated scientific glossary of the artist), Dewey Hagborg wanted to tell us how, at least surprisingly, we were each other as biological creatures.
"What I hope people will get out of this is Dewey-Hagborg, who is on display at the 2007 video business Imitations Anilar, who said that his genome is who we are and how genetic data is open to interpretation and how subjective it is.
"The DNA data can tell a lot of different stories, and that's 30 of them."
The last piece on the show held in a single room is a page from the aforementioned short comics book.
Here, Manning, King Kong style, United States Disciplinary Winters from a speaker is shown when exiting.
They say, "They have silenced their conversation."
"So do not be silent."
"This came directly from a letter I wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"When I talk about it, my hair grows stiff."
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition (as predicted by the cartoon book quite predictably) but will be greeted with masquerading as his genetic imitations, collected as a group of protesters in the middle of the room.
Like everything on display, the genetic haplogroups were made up of the lead pencil Manning (5 "2, the size of Manning), which was especially made.
Regarding portraits, Dewey-Hagborg said, "I used to put them on the wall in the past, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd."
"I wanted it to be perceived as a collective movement shaped by Chelsea, which is like the movement behind his emancipation."
Northwestern training officer and Oxford University employee wished for murder
Police said a nationwide manhunt for a Northwestern University training officer and an Oxford University employee, who was skeptical after being stabbed to death in a luxury apartment block in Chicago, was launched.
Cook administration district records show that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for first-degree murder without bail for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) alleging they had been involved in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died many times after being stabbed.
A notice issued by the Chicago Police Department says he had a corpse on July 27th.
The officers received a call, reached the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with many deep cuts in her body.
Official sources say that Cornell-Duranleau was announced to be killed at the scene, and the police actively searched for two suspects and said the detectives were investigating the stabbing as a murder.
Lathem has been an associate professor at Northwestern University since 2007, in the field of microbiology and immunology.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said by e-mail that Lathem was in administrative custody and was banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case under investigation by the necessary authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
"We are in touch with the UK police and are ready to help whatever they need authorities in the US investigation," a spokesman from the University and Somerville University e-mailed.
Beyanda was also told that Warren's colleagues were a point of contact and wanted to surrender.
Chief of Communications at the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said that he strongly encouraged suspects to surrender to authorities.
"There is a sense of where the police are at the police, but our efforts to detect it are intense," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities helped to find suspicions.
Guglielmi said that the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious clue that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the incident as terrible.
He said it was unclear whether the guglielmi incident was on July 27th.
He said that Lathem and Warren were verified as security cameras.
Guglielmi said, "We believe that the lecturer is the connection of Latham with the victim."
The executive staff at the Grand Plaza issued a statement to calmly say: "The police are still working on the victim's timeline and past, and are investigating a range of motives, including a possible family incident."
Italy confiscates German ship
The Italian police announced that they were seized in Lampedusa yesterday on the ship called Iuventa, which is in search and rescue operations for asylum seekers in the Central Mediterranean.
The police, who also shared records of telephone conversations he claimed belonged to two members, told reporters that the operation was carried out within the scope of the investigation launched by the Trabzon Prosecutor's Office in October 2016.
The Jugend Rettet members, who are allegedly "in favor of illegal immigration on the Libya-Italy line", have brought asylum seekers back to Italy at least 3 times directly from the boats of the Libyan merchant traffickers.
It is alleged that Jugend Rettet members who are questioned in the prosecutor's office have committed this crime together with some people from Libyan Coast Guard.
On top of this, it was stated in the statement made by the organization that their priorities will continue to save human lives and they are evaluating the accusations against them.
In addition to the vessels covered by the Italian Coast Guard and the European Union (EU) mission, approximately 9 international non-governmental organizations are also involved in the search and rescue of asylum seekers in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government had to prepare and sign a 13-point code of conduct for these organizations to comply.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will complete the WADA roadmap in the short vault"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to become operational again.
"In fulfilling the roadmap criteria, a certain stage has been completed, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this context, "stated Mutko on Thursday.
The prime minister was evaluating the second part of the WADA Regulation Adaptation Roadmap, which was recently published on the website of the agency and described the criteria governing the re-operation of RUSADA.
According to Mutko, it does not have anything to worry about Russia.
"Everything has been announced, all will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one criterion in the list states that Russian anti-doping officials must publicly acknowledge the reported results of a state-sponsored doping investigation in the Russian sport, made by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, approved by the WADA.
Referring to the subject, Mutko said: "While our anti-doping system accepts a failure, we conduct the investigation.
All the measures were implemented.
But there is no state program and we will not accept anything that has not existed. "
Mutko's words were repeated by Vitaly Smirnov, president of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Smirnov, who spoke earlier in the day to Russian publication RSport, acknowledged past problems with Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said at many occasions that the report contains positions and positions that create contradictions.
No one thinks to accept the report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended by WADA in November 2005 to conduct doping checks in Russia under the doping scandal.
However, this June was allowed for testing planning and coordination under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
In July, following a visit to the institution's headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli announced that RUSADA was "in the right direction" to become re-operational.

Galatasaray President does not turn hand
Faruk Süren, the former president of Galatasaray, criticized President Dursun Özbek, who went to Bucharest to persuade Mircea Lucescu and the capital Ankara for the transfer of Ndiaye, to a tough dilt.
Here are the specific explanations of the legendary president for MORNING readers:
Lucescu-Uzbek interview: "We were finished when we were gone."
The President of Galatasaray will not go to no avail, his hand will not return empty.
Ndiaye transfer: Galatasaray President does not go to football.
The player comes to the chairman's feet.
Of course, they meet or they embrace or embrace their hand ...
But no matter who the player is, the president will not go to his feet.
You give 9 million Euros to the player that Osmanlıspor has bought for 300 thousand Euros ...
It will be 9 million, not 7.5 million!
You already invested a lot, of course you will play and you will be 9 ... 9 ...
Uzbek's actions: I do not want to criticize.
But the situation is clear.
G.Saray values are getting erosion.
It's not just football, it's all wrong with the approach.
The Divan Board and the General Assembly will change this.
But as far as I know, members are happy!
Start-ups to help your company not be the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee happiness in the e-commerce start-up, but the questionnaires did not work.
The answers were often ambiguous, unhelpful, or even worse.
Some employees did not trust the process even if they committed anonymity.
Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce company in San Francisco, says, "There has never been consistency or objectivity."
He called out the outside for help.
A new kind of human resources start-up is emerging to help companies understand how their employees feel.
They allow employees to create and distribute software that measures specific occupations of specific target workers, allowing employees to do quick-check surveys, targeting specific teams and demographic groups, providing anonymity and complaint helplines to employees, bypassing top managers in some cases, and informing direct management board of irregularities.
Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Redwood City start-up Glint, who measures the work of the employees by software analysis tools companies, said: "Now there are tools to monitor your health such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is your company's Fitbit?"
Errett says he understands better what his employees think and feel after three years using Glint.
In addition to offering quick and polled surveys and questionnaires to specific teams, it also offers a heat map that shows which parts of the company have received the most complaints and which have a low rating score, so their causes can be tampered with.
In order not to be the next Uber, companies are beginning to realize that businesses must have knowledge of their culture - Uber has been in a scandal since he described an environment of harassment punished by those who clearly state what they think in a blog post published by an old employee.
For start-ups like Glint, this oversight means a very profitable job opportunity.
According to Let's Talk Payments, the financial technology insights website, the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry can be worth $ 118.7 billion by 2020.
The interest and efficiency of the Denver Colorado-based start-up Convercent, which helped companies identify and block bad behavior, increased during Uber's dismay debate earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to do personalized "pulse" polls, collect real-time hidden responses, and extract heat maps from problem areas.
In addition, the anonymous message that employees can report bad behavior offers a drop-off helpline.
If the president is charged, complaints go directly to the governing board.
Covercent's founder and president, Patrick Quinlan, spoke as follows: "The public opinion court got hold of the regulators".
Quinlan said: If a company does not behave badly or act ethically to its employees, even if regulators do not act, consumer boycotts may face costly results due to employee disruptions or lawsuits.
The restaurant chain, Ruby Tuesday, which has more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, uses Convercent for more than a year to keep employees informed about the principles and procedures and to easily reach the company headquarters.
He had to find a phone number or e-mail at the headquarters of the company when he wanted to report a problem in the past, had a formal memo and hoped he would get serious.
Ruby Tuesday's chief legal counsel, James Vitrano, said that these were mostly intimidating and disturbing experiences and that it was not a good way to follow employee complaints.
But now with the company's use of Convercent, the problems previously hidden from managers sitting at office, city or state distances (such as discrimination, harassment or unfair salary application) can be detected and solved more quickly.
Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management group, said: "I can get closer to this employment experience with a holistic, 360-degree view."
"We also protect our shareholders against business cases."
Quinlan said that after the bankruptcy of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen in 2002, due to a violation of ethical values stemming from the Enron scandal, companies were dealing with ethics, values and employee relations more seriously in 2002.
But after "social media comes to life", companies realize they will not prevent their dirty laundry from becoming viral.
"Before technology was used to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
They offer both Glint and Convercent software as a service and they charge repetitive charges for using their products.
This is a business model and opportunity where the venture capitalists support both start-ups.
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital and raised its total capital to $ 47 million.
Glint provided $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its total financing to $ 60 million.
These investments are not a surprise given the companies' naturalness, culture and risk capital.
Increasing amounts of research indicate that today's employees are expecting more from their workplace than the old.
High salaries and interesting projects in competitive markets like Silicon Valley are only minimum requirements.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued and given their time to a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint, said: "People are happy to be in a company, feel their voices heard, and become more sincere to make that company successful if they are satisfied."
Investors earn money when their portfolio companies get a good job, and companies do good work if they feel the employees are inside and the company.
It is not surprising that if third-party analytics tools promote employees' sincerity and sense of belonging, they will find support.
Having data on employee commitment is important to business culture experts.
But the data is useless if the company's responsibilities do not work.
In fact, if a company wants feedback from its employees, it can create an expectation that the change is coming.
And if the expectation does not come fast enough or does not come at all, it can create disappointment and make the employees feel as if they are broken.
"If you want 4000 suggestions, you have to be ready to talk 4000," said Russell Raath, who heads the business management firm Kotter International, who is the consulting chief and sees companies making too much trust in data collection.
"Because if you do not follow, the workers will think, 'Do you really see me?
Do you care?
And if you do not give a damn, why do you make me cry? "
According to Errett, the monthly employee survey, Madison Reed, was able to act the same day when a problem was reported in Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees who were hurt by the decision-making and quality of communication, they were able to reorganize the various teams within the company and added communication training to solve problems.
On Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights about its employees and hopes that in the long run, this kind of industry, known to have a high number of employee input and output, will become more workforce-friendly.
Vitrona said: "If you do not depend on creating a culture of transparency, you lose people."
"And if you lose people, you'll lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you'll lose companies. "
It's a long day for Bruins that the NCAA lifts two training days each day.
It's 11 o'clock in the evening and a crowd of UCLA football players hang out to chat on the side of the team's new training ground on campus.
Some have stripped the tops of their formations, revealing their slippery backs from the terrible suffering of their first day at the training camp.
For an important part of the team, these empty minutes constitute the mid-day break.
After a 3-hour training session, he will return to the players' homesties registered for the summer classes and will work on final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Center for their meeting at 6:30 the next morning.
Bruins coach Jim Mora just before returning to Monday said: "The next three days are a torment for these guys."
The NCAA's two training sessions per day, which was held to lift the load on the players, at least until the finals were finished on Friday, actually extended their days.
That's why the first three training sessions of UCLA are scheduled to begin at 7.15 in the evening so that the players can adapt to the already tight schedule.
Bruins takes the week's starting of the camp nearly a week ahead of last season, and during his summer school, Mora trains in summer school for the first time in six Westwood seasons.
They plan to train 18 until August 20, starting with the official match preparations for their opening against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said the NCAA supported rule changes, even though the players had added new items to the intensive work schedule.
Mora said: "We put a huge burden on them for three or four days, and that is very challenging."
"And they move near, they work, great kids.
I think we will have more time when we arrive on Saturday, it will be really great. "
UCLA is not an easy task when you think that the luxurious hotel Luskin Center, which is kept in the sight line of the fields, which stops the workout when camping is over, the car park next door and the soccer ball is covered by rain and the back of the castle is covered with a protective net.
Bruins players are scheduled to be in the hotel from the beginning of this week, but Mora admits that there may be a problem with the discharge of these rooms during the season.
Mora said, "We will be safe."
"It's a real concern and it's not too hard to think that someone will rent a room and sit there and film a workout.
If a workout is video recording, this is a good thing for the feast.
But we will be safe there and we will be safe in parking space 8 above.
We will do what is best we have.
I will not be worried about this much.
We have a plan. "
Facebook increases the story validation power to fight against counterfeit news
Facebook will send more potential fake articles to third-party story verifiers and show their findings under the original sharing, as the world's largest online social network tries to struggle with names called fake news on Thursday.
In a statement he made on the company website, he said they would use updated machine learning to detect possible fraud and send them to the story verifier, which would potentially show story verification results below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the main distribution points for news that is known as fake news that many think are influencing the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has turned into a major political headquarters in Europe, too, as French voters in the run-up to the election of presidential candidates in May and the support of the penalties in case of Germany's failure to swiftly remove hateful exchanges in pre-election social media networks there in September.
In a separate statement Thursday, Facebook said that a test of the new story validation feature is being launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which stories are being discussed by third-party story verifiers, people are asking for more resources about what they read and share to make informed decisions," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news flow, said in a blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the "related article" feature and will work on other changes in the news flow to reduce fake news.
Creating a comic book: The story of a castle in England
In the recent past, the tiny Scotney Castle took part in a Squeeze music clip and became a refuge for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But now Scotton, inspired by a comic strip written by Jamie Rhodes of Yorkshire, who has a broomstick, historical documents, witnessed a 700-year turbulent tranquility in the comfortable seat of the Bewl River in Kent.
"I find it very nice to look at the handwritten notes of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says in an effec- tive manner.
"How is it a personal bond to keep this letter from being removed."
A Castle in England extending from the Edward era to the Middle Ages, each story documenting the lives of a different artist from the United Kingdom (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg) who lived in Scotney.
This is not Rhodes' first book to rely on an archetype: he also wrote the Dental and Other Stories of Dead Men in 2014, a project he found unexpectedly emotionally inspired by the stories in the British Library.
"I am filled with a finger print on the side of a letter written by a bilingual agent working for King James fans in the 1700s," he says.
"That was his thumb finger!
Letters always smell because you burn a fire for that time.
For someone who will be 300 years old, this smell makes me feel like he is there too.
Ah, I love archives! "
As someone who is in love with old papers, it seems too good to get support from the National Trust and the UK Arts Council and stay in a place for almost four months ("Honestly, I'm a bit overexcited to get warm enough").
Rhodes spent his days studying the "new" castle of the Victorian era, scanning archives and working on many treasures and antiques, such as hyena heads mounted on the walls of the manor and bottles spent centuries in trenches.
Talking with the guards, the gardeners and sometimes the artists working on the illustrations of his book, he wandered the land and remains of the old castle.
Then the nights were "drinking whiskey and putting it down".
The detailed history of Scotney is unknown as National Trust can only be reached when the last heir Elizabeth Hussey died in 2006.
When Rhodes came ten years later, the staff began to handle the archive, which he describes as follows: "For centuries, the annual aristocrats said: 'Oh, put him in the attic'."
"There are letters from the days of the British empire, and maps that set the boundaries of who owns what," says Rhodes, "but you have a birch tree fighting over the two families.
Forget it, guys! "
Some of the collections in the collection, including The Labourer, a newly built castle to join the Peasant Rebellion in 1381, use Kalay as a leap point to make a wider introduction to British history.
"In this book, Kent and Sussex's Knights' Parents, there is a record of a rebellion in the place at 1380," says Rhodes.
"The Peasant Rebellion has started in this village and I think that a revolt can be a good starting point.
Maybe these two are related? "
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle, for example The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family who kept a Jesuit priest for seven years during the British Reforms.
Or The Smuggler, an 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to be filling his coffin with a coffin of stones.
The Darrells are the most popular Scotney family in Rhodes: "These ladies seemed to be pretty tricky, always borrowing money and spending money for things they could not afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt crises by marrying older elderly women, and I imagine them to be a group of handsome men who are skilled at courting female heirs. "
Rhodes is in quest of other singular writing experiences.
Fin finished a two-week job for a comic book about Elämänmäki in wildlife, the site of a sanatorium in the early 20th century, which has since been recaptured by nature.
But Scotney has a separate place in her heart.
"I'm sorry to leave," he says.
"It's like, 'Oh, I have to go now and face my fucking real life.'"
Meral Akşener'a 'Maho reaction
Nationalist Movement Party Secretary General İsmet Büyükataman recently made a written statement regarding the allegations of resignation of social media and press in connection with the MHP.
Büyükataman suggested using social media and "the corners of some old rifle Marxists" by using the "act of kin" to the MHP that "the nationalist movement was resorted to games and looms to prevent its existence under the roof of the MHP after September 12".
Büyükataman, said:
"The Turkish people rubbing their hands if they can not digest the history of their country, they can not capture the Turkish nation, how badly they are, if the crime file is fluffy, the mind is blurry, the mind is mixed."
"Now they have gone out" MHP Kocaeli Golcuk District Organization Administration and 410 members of the members and MHP Bursa in Yenişehir district 215 people resigned ".
The public is misled by unfounded unfounded news such as 250 resignations and 300 resignations.
In the newspaper column lies lies, deceit deepens.
In this issue, there is no resignation, and the number of defendants in the betting places does not cross a hand's fingers.
Büyükataman, who is in the "so-called" position regarding resignations, said that the public was trying to mislead and perception management with "so-called" polls.
Büyükataman said, "These are going to reverse the propaganda and campaigns to create perception in the face of the MHP."
MHP is an important and indispensable actor of Turkish politics voicing MHP General Secretary Büyükataman, said about resignation:
The power of the old Marxists is not enough to overcome the place where the MHP takes place in the conscience of the Turkish nation.
All comments made are behind a perceived method of perception management.
Because politics and the media, the MHP base has stared.
It does not make any sense to us that those who did not show any good work or hard work in favor of our party while we were there, now resign.
Those who can not take part in the calculation of the Nefisim resigned what gam?
MHP's life in the MHP has not touched the truth, shared our memories, did not understand our country, did not participate in the struggle, even if they joined the mentality of the coalition, hearted, crowded mausoleum must find themselves another occupation.
The efforts of those who can not capture the unity and integrity of the Nationalist Movement Party are seeking for cause, seeking debate and faction is a futile effort.
And he will surely turn back and take possession.
The Nationalist Movement is the last survivor of the Turkish nation despite the heavy destruction.
In his statement, Büyükataman said "political counterfeiters", "political catch-ups" for those whom he claimed to target, "The nationalist movement is not unfriended."
"The roots fed by the ocean will not be able to reach their purpose, no matter what the price of the outer outcrops in the interior," he said.
Büyükapaman, a MHP who uses the phrase "The traitors are going to die and the nifak will be on fire" will be able to operate the Turkish nation's right to own their own destiny no matter what they do from the CHP to the HDP and from the PKK to the FETO.
Yesterday Turkse "you MHP, without the MHP Turkey plans to play against the new tactics and games, the MHP without government, the MHP without the struggle until the last time we were fighting the bills.
Now we will ruin the games, we will ruin the players.
"It is clear that Istanbul will leave you on the edge of the cliff, saying that if you leave Istanbul on a mountain slope after traveling for days in a truck, you will have to go to power and take you to power," said Büyükataman, referring to Meral Akşener as "the patriot is the patron of the MHP."
This is their issue, but they are the only ones we want from the defenders.

Washington Modifies Green Card Rules
According to the media, President Donald Trump said he would have a new US immigrant plan that would change the Green Card rules.
It envisions legal immigrants dropping 50,000 adolescents per year, stricter rules for temporary work permits, and restrictions for family-oriented visas.
New rules were proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in both wings of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase salaries, save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and change the way the US gives Green Card to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and take the place of the current regime.
This new application process will benefit English-speaking candidates, those who have the talent to benefit from our financial resources and our economies, "according to the American media.
Authors Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz interpreted the game
I can not find two sezondur, I can not see the enthusiasm and the meeting again Kadikoy ...
Aykut Kocaman 's "barbecued" team, which he took out in the absence, was on the scene to make his deal "stand behind us" with his supporters.
We can criticize the game, the positions or the performances, but I have not watched a game that has been so functioning and searching for a long time.
He had announced in the first game but he had his own apoleties yesterday and Valbuena is now Fenerbahçe's commander on the field.
While transferring, there was a problem of age, but in the words of Kocaman there was a statement of "the character who did not give up".
30 years ago, we gave Rıza Çalımbay the name of the atomic animal.
If it does, the French player will be the best comment.
He was all over the scene, participated in all rust events, always taking responsibility, and scoring a goal, making a gigantic short-length show.
Alper's playing in front, his second striker position, Sturm Graz left his team "limited" for a long time.
Fenerbahce period, the victory over the corner, throwing such a hard wall to overcome constant formula called.
Topa dominates, but they can not produce effective rust in a competitive penalty area.
This image may bring "interpretation" but we are confronted with a game that hesitates to pass Ahmethan and does not put the only one in his position.
Either the team does not trust the young player or his performance needs to improve a bit.
After scoring 1-1, they were not able to take advantage of two net options.
It was important to go through the tour, but it was even better to lift the leg of the players, who applauded the struggle of the players, as a "goal".
Probably 1-2 new transfers will be available until monday.
But the fact is that Fenerbahçe's biggest need is number 12 ...
We are on the verge of a very sparkling and enjoyable season with this play style that carries the heart of the tribündekiler who is trying to play in the front.
Aykut Kocaman's machine is drying up, it needs more time.
Physics is good as quality.
Game quality will also develop.
You can see clearly that all players of the Sahada are increasing their self-esteem.
They need a lot of applause for a new page last night.
The rise of sex robots is real and we have to worry
While you think that 2017 can not be any more strange, there is a new report about the technological improvements in the sex robot sector.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Institute (FRR) has published a report that looks at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
We must be serious about their rise according to Christmas Sharkey, a retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and one of the founders of FRR.
Customers can choose the eye color, nozzle shape and nail type of the robot.
Mr. Sharkey spoke about the publication of the new report: "People are laughing at them, but the companies are actually shipping a lot and we will see them even more."
Modern sex babies evolved into robotics, especially human-like reactions, carried out by artificial intelligence, with warm silicon skin touching similarities that can be inflated.
Users can also customize their robots to fit their own blood by choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the nozzle-like shape and nail type or coloring.
But it gets even more uncomfortable, as many robots have "personalities" so that a Stepford woman can be innovative.
Modern sex babies evolved into silicon-skinned robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to personalize their robots according to their character traits (eg, shyness).
Then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personality, "Frijit Farrah" giving the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with the adventurous personality.
True Companion's website is excited: "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that matches your personality as closely as possible."
So what do you like if you like it, if you do not like it does not like it.
I also have moods in the day like the real people.
She may be asleep, willing to talk, or "in full" mode.
There are many disturbing sides about the rise of sex robots: not only the real human relationships are involved, but the highly submissive female personality traits, the most suggestive of the rape associations when approaching Frijit Farah.
On the website True Companion likens Roxxxy to a vibrator, but to men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator," he says, why do men have to be Roxxxy?
However, these sex robots are not just fetishes or sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a withdrawal towards sexual desire through subjugation, an optional addition to gender equality ideals.
Many men will naturally not have sex robots, and FRRs are attracting attention to their growing popularity, but for now they are part of the outer walls of consumer culture.
But those who leak from the extremes can be highly instructive about the course of the time we are living.
Many people are not as strange or aggressive as the free market gives them the right to be.
It is not a coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide, with the White House having a president boasting of sexually assaulting women.
The Handmaid's Tale The flippant side of the TV series is not the portrayal of all the details, the stained corpses or carved eyes, but how realistic the view feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but it does not feel like such a big change at the moment.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as much physical similarity as possible to real women (of course, in the proportions of porn movie stars) as technologically as possible.
Creators want them to feel human touch and imitate their movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personalities", robots can not clearly represent real women.
They can not leave their wives or leave them.
There are no activities or past stories, nothing to reveal their independence or disrupt the fantasy of total slavery.
In other words, they are delightful slaves.
Or by the year 2017: caries.
Attack on American military convoy: There are deaths and injuries ...
The suicide bombing of Karabakh province of Afghanistan's capital, Kabil, targeted foreign military forces operating in the country.
1 NATO troops and 3 civilians were killed in the explosion, 5 wounded American soldiers in the convoy, and 1 wounded by NATO forces.
In a formal statement by NATO support forces in Afghanistan (Resolute Support), it was stated that NATO forces detonated a homemade explosive device during a joint patrol duty with the Afghan National Army.
The wounded personnel are being treated at the American Military Hospital in Bagram Airport.
The wounded are not in vital danger.
Local suicide bombers are reportedly members of the Taliban.
Trump's great skill?
Show Mitt Romney as a common sense
The political division of the US voters was the reality of the Trump era in the division of families on a micro scale.
Near Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US were filled with how to deal with the nightmares of relatives who voted for Trump.
We are all trying to blow up our own filtering bubbles.
The less talked about is the power to bring Trump's families together.
I am referring to this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has broken up with Republicans in my family, visits us this week in New York.
He reminded me that there might be a strong influence on unity against a common enemy.
Everyone he knows, including his Republican brother, whom Trump has argued for decades over politics in the White House, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
Of course this is a good thing for the dinner table, but it seems to me that in a wide context these risks are significant.
The left was portrayed by Trump, but the bending effect created by his presidency created a push to the right for all of us.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, one day we talk about the terrible possibility that his strange behavior may no longer shock.
There is even a more terrifying long-term scenario, in which Trump "normalizes" the right-wing Republicans against their own standards, and they seem to be a symbol of logic.
I find myself nostalgic about the strange version of Mitt Romney's madness: these are the dogs on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what it looked like), both of which are really mildly offensive to Trump.
When Trump is gone, the next Republican candidate must be in a good mood to be judged by his incalculable development.
When my cousin is in town, we take our kids to the car park in Central Park, the biggest of the mall cars run by the New York park department, and the best three bucks you can spend in town if you do not need cafe.
The horses are huge, the central fiberglass designs (all clowns and animals that make strange faces turn to look fearfully behind their shoulders), and the tingling music is a freakishly exciting ride.
In other words, many of the townships of a city can be frustrating: the high-rise buildings start to look boring, the horizon becomes so familiar that it can not create much excitement, and the reality of the city does not reach its destination.
Thirty-five years ago, and I still could not come to the top of the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage is not actually a Swiss country house (it's not the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage) but a large roundabout in North London.
However, the carousel in Central Park is still a strange magical experience, such that two-year-old two-year-old, 11-year-old and 40-year-old can go here and all can have a very good time.
If I could give a note to the carousel I gave him a full note, but thank God no one asked.
On the other hand, this week I was asked to rate my transaction "experience" between 1 and 5 stars before I switched my credit card to a bonfire.
The same thing in the coffee shop on the corner of my street, and the option to match the note with a 15% tip, for what was bought from the countertop ...
The effect of this is not only to slow down the need to be an impartial shopper but also to put pressure on the server to gain personality that is not needed at all.
While the poor woman in Bonmaden grinning like a standing apology, I gave five stars in my experience of giving credit card to her hand.
When temperatures reached 41 degrees, they dressed in mayo
In Tunceli, where one of the hottest days of the season lived, people flocked to Munzur beaches.
The young, children, elderly, women and men who entered the beaches along the Munzur Stream tried to protect themselves from the heat by cooling off in the cold waters.
Tunceli citizens living in countries such as Germany, Holland, France and England especially filled the beaches of the Munzur Stream because the Tunisian citizens spent their holidays instead of Aegean or Mediterranean.
Suna Tosun, who is one of the coolers on Munzur Beach, stated that he preferred Tunceli instead of western lights for holiday and said "It was better to stay in our own land to cool off in Munzur, the family I did not want to spend in the west."
"Munzur's ice-cold water is nowhere else in the world, and in these temperatures Munzur refreshes us," he said.
Hasan Ulu from Germany said that they chose the Munzur Stream in Tunceli instead of Çeşme or Bodrum owners and that they did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital with chest pain
This is the second time that Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, the prison officials were taken to the hospital for treatment of cuts in their wrists, which they said had fallen down after falling on the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after his objection to the previous accidental murder by prosecutors.
Early in the year of the 2013 Sevenths Day, he shot Steenkamp several times towards the door of a toilet cabin in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he had confused his girlfriend with someone who had been intruding inside the night of his hideaway.
The prosecutors announced that they intend to once again appeal against Pistorius's six-year sentence, which they consider to be too light.
The National Prosecution Authority said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be assessed this year.
If the prosecutors succeed, Pistorius will face a 15-year penalty.
There is no death sentence in South Africa.
The first pilgrimage party
Pilgrim candidates who would go to Saudi Arabia through the organization of the Directorate of Religious Affairs were presented with tears and prayers at the Atatürk Airport International Terminal Departure Terminal.
Prior to the first pilgrimage movement, approximately 200 pilgrims, as well as relatives and citizens, participated in the ceremony held at the International Terminal.
On the other hand, Turkish Airlines (THY) rode the podium to the pilgrims who went to the holy land with scheduled flights.
The pilgrimage house in Ankara was opened by Esanboğa.
Relatives of martyrs and veterans who took advantage of the application of "pilgrimage for pilgrims and relatives of martyrs" applied this year for the first time in Kafile also took place.
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece Due to Illegal Camping
According to the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and quoted by the bTV, two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece on grounds of illegal camping.
A group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by the police on the morning of August 1st in Sithonia.
The investigation was left on the same day as it was already underway.
The ministry of foreign affairs informed bTV that the Bulgarians were later abandoned.
Greek authorities tightened controls over free camping and severely punished those who were arrested while still in places not reserved for that purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the prisoner could be punished.
We will not return to Holland before we find him
JOEY Hoffman (22) went to Turkey to visit with his two friends at the beginning of July.
Joey Hoffman, who visited Adana and Mersin with the vehicle they rented, disappeared in Silifke on 8 July.
The friends he came with told the Dutch family when they could not reach Hoffman despite all the calls.
While the police were taking action to find the missing tourist, his brother Robin Hoffman and his friends Angelo Durei and Jaimy Gewald went to Adana.
PROMOTIONS DISTRIBUTION
Robin Hoffman, who was a police applicant, dispatched his missing advertisements to Adana and Mersin to find his brother.
Robin Hoffman informed his brother last July 8, "We applied to the police first in the Netherlands."
Then I came to Turkey with my two friends and applied to the police here.
We have not found any clues that have not received any news so far.
"Until my brother is found, we will stay in Turkey until a news is received," he said.

The last words 'I think I'm dead, goodbye mother'
"I do not want to die, Mom, it's not fair at all," said Grenfell Tower in London, who has been 30 so far.
"Thank you for everything you did for me, goodbye," said Italian Gloria Trevisan, "and she is also a lover.
Among the dozens of people who could not hear the news after the fire, Gloria Trevisan, 26, who lives on the 23rd floor of the 24-story building, and Marco Gottardi, the Italian lover.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer for the Trevisan family living in the north of Italy, announced that according to the information they obtained from the British authorities, it became clear that two genera lost their lives.
The lawyer, who expressed that the families of the young people are suffering a great deal, also asked the journalists not to insist on getting an explanation on this issue.
I think I'm dying, goodbye mom
Lawyer Sandri said that Gloria was also crying when she listened to her mother, Emanuela Trevisan, shortly after the fire started, and listened to her mother's last recorded conversations.
Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times over the next 2 hours after the fire started around 01:00 local time.
Trevisan said, "Mom, there are bad things happening here, there's a fire."
We're trapped, we can not get out.
There's a little smoke, but do not worry, we're waiting to be saved.
"We tried to get out by opening the door, but there was too much smoke and the elevator was not working," he said.
Gloria Trevisan, who is increasingly worried about the future searches of the fire, is quoted as saying:
Mom, my whole life is crossing my eyes.
I think I'm dying.
There was a life I would live in front of, it is not fair.
I do not want to die and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I can not hug you again.
Thank you for everything you did for me, goodbye mom.
I am going to cennete now and I will help you from there.
This is the fault of the Italian government
Both Gloria Trevisan and her beloved Marco Gottardi, both studying architecture, moved to London from the Veneto region in the north of the country in March, after having had difficulty finding jobs since graduating last year.
Gloria Trevisan, who had only paid 300 euros in her country, began to work in London with a pension of 1800 pounds (about 2060 euros) in a short time.
Lawyer Sandri said Gloria Trevisan "ın's family had a hard time financially," Gloria went to London to help her family. "
Unfortunately our young people have to leave the country to save their future and find a job.
"The government must find a solution to this problem immediately," he said.
Italy's drama, which can not provide jobs for young people
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, said in anger, "This is the fault of our culprit, who forced our young people to escape to work abroad."
While the unemployment rate in Italy is 12 percent, the ratio of young people is 40 percent.
Over the last couple of years, many Italian young people have started to migrate to many European countries, especially England.
Only last year, the number of young people who had to leave Italy due to unemployment exceeded 110.
Commenting on the deaths of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi in the Italian press, it is said that this is the drama of a country that can not provide jobs for young people.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can alleviate IBD
Red meat and chocolate may be a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the exact opposite: A rich diet of meat-based protein and dairy products can help alleviate symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This untreatable health condition affects 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom, causing stomach cramps and swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While the disease is often advised to skip meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of protein helps immune cells develop a durable gut.
Principal investigator Dr. Marco Colonna stated that immune cells were patrolling the intestines so that the microbes hidden in the food would not sneak into the body.
The cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that encourage endurance without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance shifts too much towards inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may result.
Experiments have shown that some kind of immune cell has emerged in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines, promoting endurance.
And the bacteria need tryptophan, one of the building blocks of protein, to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna: 'We have linked the growth of bacterial Lactobacillus reuteri, a part of intestinal microbiology, to a cell population that promotes endurance.'
Mice with more tryptophan in their feeds had more of these immune cells. '
If the same thing happens in humans, he suggests that a diet rich in L. reuteri and tryptophan could develop a more durable, less inflammatory bowel environment.
Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, a postdoctoral researcher, discovered that while a group of immune cells worked on some kind of immune system, a group of experiments had such cells, but another group of the same species and held in a different place did not.
It was suspected that the difference is related to intestinal microbiomas of mice, in other words bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA sequences of the intestines of the mice were made and found to be six bacterial strains in mice with immune cells but missing in those mice without them.
L. reuteri was given to mice lacking an intestinal microbiology and not developing such an immune cell because they were looked at in a sterile environment, and immune cells appeared.
To understand how bacteriocin affects the immune system, researchers have grown L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred it in small quantities to this immature immune cell from bacteria that is bacteria-free.
Immune cells have become cells that promote durability.
The active ingredient, when purified from the liquid, appeared to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice 'nutrients, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were lowered, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have cells that promote the same endurance as mice and that many of them have L. reuteri in the gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the tryptophan side products from L. reuteri have developed in humans as well as in mice, but the defects in genes related to tryptophan are found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
He said: "The development of these cells is something we probably want to encourage because these cells are controlling the inflammation inside the intestines.
High levels of tryptophan cause this population to spread when potentially L. reuteri is present. "
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United is signing a 'genius' with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic after the midfielder came out his first game against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
£ 40 million transfer from Chelsea started with a 2-1 victory in Dublin ahead of United's UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday's last pre-season match, and Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira looked ahead to the position they held in a forward attack.
However, the Maviler's Matic, left out of the pre-season Asia tour, was severely lacking in match conditioning and could only take 45 minutes, confessing that Mourinho had to be improved before the Premier League season began.
Mourinho said, "We need time, but experience, intelligence, genius in the way of thinking ... He thinks about football."
"We will help him to be ready sooner."
As Mourinho began to shape the top 11 for the season, Matic, his new transfer friends Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also played at the Aviva Stadium.
The Independent revealed that Mourinho still wants three more transfers this week, but the club has already insisted that he has done three "out of four priority transfers" and made a "extraordinary job."
"I thank the club for taking the third of the four," he added.
"If they take four out of four, they will be happier, but they make a great effort for me."
197 people were sent to the hospital last year
According to the Swedish Welfare Society data, the gender dissatisfaction of 1 person in one hundred thousand persons in 2005 increased to 8 in one hundred thousand in 2015.
197 children and young people, most of whom were dissatisfied with the sex they were born in last year, were referred to the Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital.
"The psychosexual clarity, including questions about sexual identity, can be perceived as a general development in the society," said Lousise Frisen, a child psychiatrist at the same hospital, who may have come from a more open society.
Gender dissatisfaction is known to have no connection with sexual orientation.

The British inventor used a hand gesture to insert a micro chip into his home and into his car
A British inventor was the first person to install a microchip in the country to open his front door, access his office, and even run his car with just a hand gesture.
Steven Northam (33) transported his tiny chip between his thumb and finger and presented it with BioTeq, a business and people company that wants to make life easier with technology.
To ensure that the implant procedure can be applied in medical standards, he went to work with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthetist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winters, Hants.
The technology is similar to the microchip transplanted to cats and dogs and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company will also change the locks on the houses and cars, up to £ 300 per lock, to be compatible.
The man who is married and has a child, both the house and the BMW Z4, is fitted with this technology and the car is working while the hands are on the wheel.
White House Demonstration Costs Thousands of Taxpayers
According to the military records released to TIME, the White House's decision to fly a marine market helicopter to the southern gardens for an organization that highlighted American production last month cost taxpayers up to $ 24,000.
At the time of the President's meeting, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the focus of attention at the White House, which introduced American build programs on July 17th.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials traveled throughout the 50 states.
A helicopter in Connecticut, a yacht from Main, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House War Department requested a helicopter presence on an individual order (also called FRAGO) helicopter only 36 hours before landing on the southern grass for "unusual" organization.
The day before the organization of HMX-1, the top Marine Commander of the Aviation Command, sent an e-mail saying, "I just want to make sure you're aware because this is an unusually high visibility organization."
The message indicated that the helicopter would stay in the southern grass of the morning on July 17th, around 7pm, for the organization for the 3rd, and stay there until 6 to 9 am on the grassy evening.
The note added that if the exit from the White House was delayed, a second flight team would be required for the return flight due to duty limitations.
While the unit security personnel aircraft stood in the ground, the original flight crew was in the helicopter during the organization.
It is unclear whether a second flight crew is ultimately necessary from the records provided to TIME.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating whether the organization violated this requirement.
"The question we asked was whether or not it violated the Hatch Code and it was declared not to do us," the commander wrote.
"It seems that you are locked," replied the Commandant.
The "Made in America" organization has been designated as an official organization by the White House and is not covered by the Hatch Code.
But even official organizations have political implications.
At the organization, the president then tries to reform health care services in senate and pays for his efforts to curb government regulations.
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents need to use them to travel.
But it is unusual for them to be officially requested to use only one photo opportunity.
Trump was noticed when the presidential plane in February went to the stage of the first campaign meeting in Melbourne Florida and the Twitter account was filled with messages about the use of the seat of the seatbelts.
Lindsay Walters, the White House press secretary, said: "The White House is thrilled by the 'Made in America' exhibit of American products made by American workers throughout the 50 states.
The HMX-1 crew frequently conducts training flights in the Washington area and is practicing to leave the US President in the South Laurel spot on the White House.
Trump made 58 practice landings in HMX-1 White House while in Germany for the G-20 summit in early July.
One official said that the flight for the Made in America organization was counted as the training crew of the air crew within that month.
Unit helicopters flew an additional 11 hours for "support missions that were not relevant to the presidency" that day.
The White House said taxpayers were not charged for any other numbers in the organization.
A spokesperson from Sikorksky said the companies did not participate in setting up the helicopter on the southern grass.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to pinpoint the exact costs incurred by the organization.
But according to the hourly rates for the Department of Defense's fiscal year 2017, the Defense Department's VH-3D coverage rate is $ 24,340 per flight hour.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes on either side of the headquarters of Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico Virginia.
The White House claims that the helicopter's actual operating cost is well below this rate.
"It is very misleading for taxpayers to make an expense based on cost-of-living estimates," Walters said.
"These rate estimates include wasted costs included in staff, maintenance and annual costs."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Defense Department's cost of living does not include staff costs, but includes fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Back then, the White House former press spokesman, Sean Spicer, advocated the use of helicopters for this organization.
Spicer said, "Here are the things to do here in the United States."
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the contributions they make to our national security, and I think that even though there are not thousands, the work of hundreds of people depends on it.
And like most Americans, I think we're all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans have worked tirelessly to do.
Therefore, of course, it is appropriate to bring it forward. "
It is not clear if Trump interacted with the helicopter while walking around the southern grass for the organization, but he stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump joked about the company's products in the media and his own fleet, and spoke to Sikorsky representatives.
The president said, "I know Sikorsky very well." He said, "I've got three of them."

According to B.M., Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women
The head of the B.M.'s mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections could be representative if all sectors of society, including women, play a role.
Nicholas Haysom, deputy chairman of the B.M. Assistance Mission, says hundreds of women compete in the county council elections, three women compete for vice-presidency, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women can not be exaggerated," she said in her Wednesday statement.
Elections only women are fully engaged and can be truly representative and trustworthy if they are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will take place on April 5th.
The Taliban threatened the electoral process, which coincided with the time when international military operations turned into advisory posts.
This year's elections are the first time for a democratically elected government to point to a peaceful shift in power.
Haysom said the strong role of women would contribute to the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission is reporting that 1.2 million women are enrolled in 3.6 million registered electives.

McVitie's investment in Glasgow factory worries GMB
A trade union is seeking assurances from biscuit-maker McVitie's managers to give a long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow factory.
GMB Scotland said the company is silent about the future of the investment in the Tollcross region.
In addition to other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits are produced in the factory, more than 500 people work.
McVitie's owner, Pladis, has said they have invested more than 5 million pounds in the region over the last few years.
Employees and union representatives will be "informed first" if there is a change in their operations.
In a letter to the company's installation manager, GMB demanded that McVitie's "worry about not funding for the modernization of production lines" from Scotland.
Drew Duffy, GMB senior organizer, said: "The plant general is deeply concerned about not seeing the clarity of business needs and the investment plan for Tollcross's future.
Generation-sized families work here and the workforce is concentrated in the local community and in an area where high unemployment and social deprivation are concentrated in Glasgow and its suburbs, which are critical responsibilities for adequate employment.
From the perspective of work, salary and welfare, Brexit conditions urgently need a four-star production presence at McVitie's, east of Glasgow, against rising living costs and chronic production decline. "
A woman spokesperson from Pladis said: "The facility manager at Tollcross GMB received a letter yesterday from Scotland and the company will respond directly to the worker and the union representatives we value the commitment.
At Tollcross, we held a regular meeting with employees and representatives of GMB two months ago, where a few issues were openly discussed.
We then told our employees that we, like all companies doing business in an overly competitive and uncertain economic environment, are constantly on the lookout for our operations, which are valid for our entire business and facilities, to remain competitive.
He added: "In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in the Tollcross plant, especially in production lines and operational developments.
We fully recognize the inheritance of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility, and if there is any change in our operations, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know. "

PSG, did you warn Barcelona about Neymar's departure three years ago?
It may have regretted the fact that La Liga was in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar's follow-up after the offer to mobilize the £ 189 million release, but will he warn Barcelona to plunder the world record three years ago?
The sensational proposal moved the summer transfer season, as the Ligue 1 team was ready to beat the world record transfer of more than twice the previous amount that Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season against £ 89 million.
PSG's monthly salary of £ 500,000 after taxation suggests that Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world and the most profitable professional athlete when the transfer is completed.
It is known that Barcelona is angry about the style of the proposal and Neymar's attempt to break apart, although a source close to the Catalans' administration does not insist that the club has always done its best to keep an eye on it since the advent of Santos in 2013.
So, was the football world warned by the PSG president about this landscape three years ago?
When Manchester City Blaise Matuidi expressed interest in signing in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi made a stern warning to all the clubs that wanted to sign one of the PSG's best players.
Al-Khelaifi said, "I am not worried because they know that if we touch one of our players, then we will be against them, we will pass them by their players."
"We respect all the clubs.
But if our actors try to sign one of them, they will suffer the consequences. "
The Spanish club Barcelona seems to have crossed the line at the beginning of this summer, expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
The PSG has shown that they will not allow the Italian mill to leave in any condition, and Barcelona feels well by losing Neymar, one of the greatest values of this attraction.
The punishment for hindering the reading of Sala is broken
The defendants Kenan Gülşen and Nait Yılmaz who allegedly tried to obstruct themselves by walking on the Imam Mustafa Baki of Küçükçekmece Gültepe Mosque, who reads Ezan and Sela, were convicted on charges of "knowing and willingly helping with knitting and not being a member", "resistance to not to perform duty" and "insult"
He was tried by the High Criminal Court.
The court sentenced Gülşen to 1 year imprisonment on charges of "resisting not to perform the task", taking into account the importance of public opinion and the future of Turkey in terms of the date and time of the offense, as well as the duty of the accused Yilmaz, who was prevented from making the victim, to the Gülşen "insulting the public officer for his duty" and giving the victim a complaint of 7 thousand pounds.
The delegation ruled that Yilmaz's sentence of imprisonment would be converted into a fine of 6 thousand pounds.
After two judicial monetary penalties, the defendants' lawyers demanded appeal.
File to be examined by the Istanbul Regional Court of Justice 23.
He came to the Penal Department.
Completing the examinations, the appellant found that the suspect's penalty for the defendant was appropriate by deciding on the grounds that the applicant was defensible on grounds that the defendant, Kenan Gülşen, had been punished for the "offense" in the legal context and that the action was properly defined and committed.
When the defendant Nait Yilmaz read the imam Mustafa Baki, who read the words of the defendant Nahe Yilmaz, and said that he was pouring "What an ezanı, what kind of a nativity, the nation is pouring on the street" by the High Criminal Court.
The President was taken.
"It is finished," said the act of attempting to walk and strike on the grounds that it is the crime of "resistance to not to do the task" as it is assumed that the imam, the victim, is unable to read the rumor and salvation which should be read at certain intervals.
Despite the reasons given by the local tribunal, the court stated that the act was carried out when the victim had finished his task of reading and punishing the prisoner and informed the public in front of the mosque and stated that there was an insufficiently reasoned judgment without explaining whether the victim had started or continued to perform his duty or not.
He explained that the defendant had no criminal record and that there was no material financial damage to the victim because of the criminal charges. He also stated that moral hazard is not an impediment to the application of the declaration of the sentence and that it is not discussed whether the victim has given up his complaint.
THE FILE WAS RETURNED, THE FILE RETURNED The apartment which sees the appeal claims of the defendant Nait Yilmaz's lawyer for this reason decisively decides to return the file to the first instance court for the impunity of the accused.
Interpol's live bombs list 6 Europeans
German newspaper Die Welt wrote that Interpol (International Police Service) sent a list of 173 people who had the potential to commit suicide attacks on behalf of the terrorist organization DEAS last May to the police in Europe.
It is reported that the 132 people on the list are from Iraq, North Africa, Gulf states, Tajikistan and Bangladesh.
Six people on the list were European citizens.
These people are coming from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Bosnia.
