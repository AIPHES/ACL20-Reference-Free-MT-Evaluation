The latest: Our cosmic Visit Dev Asteroit 2014 JO25
There are billions of perhaps more huge skies in the solar System that are starved and could have serious consequences when they collide.
The path of these cats, which can have indoor or open orbits left out of the sun's formation, can sometimes pass through Earth.
The 650-foot-wide asteroid 2014 JO25 is such a visitor and will pass through 1.75 million miles away, the closest location to Earth, at 14:24 a.m. today.
As the day wore on, we became more often heard of this kind of news.
The main reason is improvements in monitoring techniques and monitoring appliances.
In this way, we also have the opportunity to determine smaller-scale asteroids that have not been determined before.
Last January, for example, a bus-sized asteroid travelled to and from a distance of just half the Earth and Month distance (about 25 km).
And the even more interesting asteroid was able to be set just a few days before the switch.
So there could be other cosmic buses coming over us right now.
Think, if you get the news that a 20-foot-wide asteroid will fall into the middle of the neighbourhood where you are, what would you do?
In fact, asteroids of this scale do not destroy our neighbourhood, but probably the windows of all buildings will be explosive.
This will be due to shockwaves spreading from the asteroid that will infiltrate the atmosphere.
The asteroid, which crashed into Russia in 2013, for example, was on that scale and was enough to tear apart the windows of buildings in a few cities.
However, if you have a neighbourhood in the target of a 100m-wide asteroid, your advice is to go at least 50 km from your neighbourhood.
Criteria such as the size of the asteroid and the point of collision are the factors determining the depth of the crystal and the damage caused by the collision.
Let's take a look at a few scenarios, according to the simulation of the European Space Agency.
If a 100m-wide asteroid sits on Earth at a speed of 60 km per second, with a 45-degree view, it will form a krater with a depth of about 250 metres and a height of 1,200 metres.
The collision is equivalent to a quake measuring 6 on the Richter scale, and even if you're 10 km away from the point of collision, it's a 3rd degree burn in your body.
Those 50 km away will be waiting for the broken window windows.
If a 1km-wide asteroid is twisted, the situation becomes even more internal.
Such an asteroid, with the same angst and speed value, sits on Earth, at a depth of about 600 metres and a height of 12 km.
So a coca semiconductor would turn into a king and instantly disappear.
Even if you are 100 miles away from the collision point due to the heat caused by the collision, there is a 3rd degree burn in your body.
The collision is equivalent to an earthquake measuring 8 on the Richter scale.
The damage to the Asteroids depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid, but also on the rocky structure of the area where it will collide.
The values above were given in reference to the scenario that arose if a rough rock-like asteroid crashed into an area made up of tortoise rocks.
If the asteroid is made up mostly of the railroad, it falls into a surface formed by the onset of the lavors, the calf size will increase by 3 times, and the resulting disaster will suffer.
About 66 million years ago, the dinosaurs had something more cramped on their heads and were hit by a disaster that hit an asteroid about 10 km wide.
Due to the Asteroit collision, 75% of sea and land livelihoods were instantly destroyed.
If this very large asteroid that destroyed the Dinoles had targeted Earth, the most robust option for sure would be to leave the planet.
Tongue-in-cheek material falls on Earth every day from space.
Most of them burn and burn in the atmosphere.
Some skies, which are large enough, burn in the atmosphere, leading to shrinks commonly known as star slides.
Let's terminate our work with another news that will bring internal relief.
The work shows that, over the next 300 to 400 years, an extremely huge asteroid that will cause very serious devastation is not expected to hit Earth.
As vigilantes who live an average of 70 years, I am sure your instinct has been somewhat relieved.
Flagship claim for Medel: 10 m euros!
Gary Medel, who is certain to leave Inter, is the man on the agenda for the Black Cats who want to reinforce the Stoper region....
The 30-year-old, who is on holiday after a spell in the Confederate Cup with the Chile striker and recently started reworking with Inter, is waiting for offers to come to him.
Gazzetta dello Sport, one of the Italians' prestigious newspapers, suggested that Besiktas, for Medel, who could be involved in both the stoppage and the front-row area, had made a 10m-euro bid for Inter.
Presenting his offer to Medel, he said he expected answers from both sides, while the Chilean footballer was keen to live with his family in Istanbul.
Despite Gazzetta's claim, the Black Eagles, the FFP limit, are unlikely to pay as much as 10 m euros for Medel.
There is a possibility that the black-and-Beyoncé will first turn to Medel through lease, as in the Caner Erkin transfer, or add the star to the squad if there is a significant reduction in his bonus.
Besiktas reported Negredo transfer to the stock market
Human rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
For colourful people who will travel to Missouri, the National Association for the Progress of Renee People has issued a warning over the province's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The Grupun statement reads: "The NAACP Travel Tavsie Statement of the state of Missouri is valid from August 28, 2017, and it would give a salute to African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri residents to pay special attention and be very cautious when travelling to the end of the province, as stated there, because recent sceptical, race-based events occur across the province."
The NAACP said a new Missouri law makes it harder for people to win discrimination cases, but also because the province's law enforcement disproportionately targets minorities, making it effective for the group to issue that travel warning.
"There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They are stopped, beaten and killed because of the colour of their Derby, "said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP for the Cancer City Star.
"We hear complaints at the rate we haven't heard before," he said.
It is the first time the association has issued such a warning for a county in the United States.
The group cited racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders was detained earlier this year before being charged with a crime by Missouri police after his fuel was finished as he passed through the province and died under suspicious circumstances.
The recommendation statement also points to a new report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the province are likely to be stopped by 75 percent more than whites.
"The Tavsie declaration is for people to be vigilant and to warn their families, friends and colleagues that they can be in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People should be ready, whether they want to bring bail money together, or to inform their relatives that they will go through this province."
In Missouri, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015, according to the latest figures in the FBI's hate crimes reporting program; that puts the province 16th in the country in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it more difficult to sue an employer for discriminating when they are renting housing or doing business.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona after local executive authorities in those counties passed immigrant-force laws ordering people to arrest them for immigration violations; the ACLU says it would increase enforcement based on race.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to the practice in response to a number of laws and trends inside the United States.
Demba Ba complete in Besiktas
Demba Ba, who moved to Chinese team Shanghai Shenhua for £13 m two seasons ago and was loaned to the Black Cats by the giants last season, is returning to Besiktas without cost.
The Black Eagles, who asked the Senegalese player for a detailed health report last week, moved in after a report from the star footballer.
Black-Beyoncé management, which has started work for the 32-year-old, whose Chinese representative is not considering on the roster next season, has knocked on the door of the Shanghai team.
It was not written on the list
Demba Ba, who was not written on the list because of his foreign status in China, has conveyed to the administration that he wants to go back to Black - whites.
The Chinese team approved the 32-year-old's departure.
The Senegalese player is expected to arrive in Turkey in the coming days and sign an official contract.
Image caption Castillo underwent surgery
A statement on the club's website said Castillo had undergone an artroscopic meniscus operation from his left knee at Istanbul Liv Hospital, adding: "It is envisaged that our post-operation player, carried out by Professor Ugur Rights, will start training with the team within 4 weeks."
Castillo suffered a right back injury during the borderline team's friendly against Dutch team Heerenveen in the Slovakia camp.
The Colombian player, who was announced to be out of the field for 3-4 weeks due to his treatment, was also scheduled to undergo surgery due to a meniscus problem he had previously suffered.
A referendum exit from Barzan!
Barzani delivers a speech at a memorial service in the city of Duhok marking the 3rd anniversary of the terrorist group DEA's attack on the Euphrates in Mosul's Sincar district.
"I have to say sorry, we have no hope that Iraq will be the right and proper country," Barzani said in his speech, referring to the independence referendum that IKBY wants to hold on September 25th.
We tried all the ways with Iraq, but we were completely helpless and hopeless.
Our past experience with Iraq has brought us into this situation and there is no guarantee that we can take our rights and protect them.
That is why we all need to show the world that we can ensure our destiny through a referendum so that co-existence and security can be assured.
I need to underline that; the referendum is not a goal for us, but a means for us to achieve the larger goal.
Recalling that the Iraqi central government made a number of commitments to the Kurds after the fall of the Baas Reef in 2003, Barzani said a direct referendum had been taken after the fight against the DEA, noting that the disaster in Sincar had occurred soon.
Barzani said he wants to ensure the peaceful and democratic destiny of the people of IKBY for self-protection and development. "It has emerged with the documents that Iraq cannot or does not want to protect us like a state," he said.
"He doesn't want us to move forward," he argued.
Barzani responded that during the fight against the terrorist group DEA, the Iraqi central government did not give them weapons, but that the Houthis, which was recently formed with a fuse, were immediately legalized and all weapons cleared.
In Iraq's defence system, the Peshmerga has not been muted.
The central government did not make it to the Peshmerga, which it presented to the Houthis.
The Peshmerga is considered part of Iraq's defence system, according to the constitution.
However, the Houses of Parliament have no presence in the constitution, while the laws have been violated and all impediments have been mobilised.
We are not saying that we are against the Houses of Parliament.
The Peshmerga and the Houthis fought on the same front, but why, on the one hand, are the Houthis legalized, the existence of the Peshmerga and the fight against terrorism covered up?
That is why these are our deep wounds with Baghdad.
On August 3, 2014, the terrorist group DEA carried out an attack on the Euphrates in Sincar, Mosul, killing a number of people, including women and children.
He was returned from a facelift with 10 minutes to go
The Boeing 777-type passenger plane belonging to Air France airlines was west of Hokkaido in northern Japan when North Korea's missile was in the air, according to the BBC.
The missile crashed into the area where the plane was found 10 minutes ago, officials said, noting that the missile was estimated to have come as close as 100-150 miles from the plane.
Air France said in a statement that the missile had not been cut off by the plane's route and that there had been no problems with the flight in question.
"The information we have at this stage indicates that the missile crashed into the sea more than 100 miles from the plane's course," the statement said.
Is nothing sacred?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty
The most definitive sign of regime change is that they are starting to attack statues.
Americans can be as rosy as any of this; the nightly, self-orchestrated Saddam Hussein's 2003 ouster in Baghdad's Firdos Square...
Stephen Miller, one of the key comedians of the Trump regime, knew exactly what he was doing while symbolically destroying the Statue of Liberty in a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta about the president's proposals to sharply restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he had done so, he would have had a slew of boat rounds and the Freedom takeaway would have lynched him.
But he attacked his manuscript, and especially his manuscript, which was thrown at him in 1903 after the memorial itself was added to Emma Lazarus's well-known poetry memorial base 17 years after it was completed.
As Miller exited Acosta: "I don't want to talk about history from scratch here, but the Statue of Liberty... is the absurd symbol of American freedom to the world.
The poetry you mentioned was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller is actually right, but as he himself says, that's not really about history.
This is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's chilling words, and it seems that not only did a state in them invite not only some older immigrants but also the poor: "Tired, poor, / Twin-packed masses are harmed to get the right to freedom, / the perilous desirability of the packed carpet."
There was never a time when "peripheral desirability" was so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't bring a literary critique; it was clear that these people were not welcome in Trump's United States.
The conflict about the mantle of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: This is actually a conflict about America's mantra.
Lazarus and his friends, who campaigned after his death to put his words at the base of the statue, knew very well that they were engaged in quite a political act.
The monument was intended to celebrate the connections between French and American republicanism, with an imperative, by representing Freedom in the form of a woman.
Lazarus changed that logic: In his poem, the female figure was no longer abstract, he had a voice.
And it gives him a very varied ad: The Annals of those who have been deported.
The poem's marriage to appearance is a daunting feminist coup and a devastating attack on American anti-immigrant.
And as the same Lazarus changed the mantle of the statue, right-wing extremists have long wanted to change it back.
Big palate Rush Limbaugh, a Baptist John-style one for Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that Freedom did not invite anyone in, but rather an early handover neocon that kept American fire in the dark-faced world: "Female Freedom is coming forward.
He exists to carry the torch of freedom from the United States of America to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to illuminate the path to the United States of America. "
Hardly unusual, Limbaugh had actually discovered something.
The rationale for the statue was entirely about perception.
Lazarus's magnificent creative act was to see it as if it was seen after long and often ferocious journeys by exhausted, perilous but promising people on the deck of ships.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people who are looking for a place to shelter and want to improve their lives.
His statue corresponded to them with words of hope and the warm welcome they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not a perspective that Miller and Trump will find justified in any way.
Their torch is not to show way, but to lessen the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle recalls the time only two Scottish teams were able to enter the Great Britain squad
United Kingdom Athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish group on the World Championship roster will make a "huge contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which began on Friday.
Black believes "something is developing" in Scotland and that United Kingdom athletics should learn from it.
"We're adopting it and we're trying to understand it and we're going to deal with it until we get out of it," Black said.
He said: "I'm talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish Atletico think this is about what they are doing.
British athletics: He thinks this is about their actions.
So is the ordinary man in the corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, this is absolutely wonderful. "
Many Scottish horses are competing for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah at 50 mph, while Eilidh Doyle has been selected as captain by the squad.
"Eilidh is a bit of a low-key volunteer.
The captain's speech was unbelievable, "says Black.
"Regardless of whether they are Scottish or wherever they live or train, a few athletes have been very proud and really motivated by that room," he said.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally catches was amazing.'
The silver medallist from the Commonwealth Games, who herself will compete in the 400 m hurdles at the fifth World Championships, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scottish players are in the UK squad.
Scotland's best total athlete figure at previous world championships was the one achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, the middle-distance runner who set five British and two European records last year, is the leader.
He will join 1,500 m and 5000 m.
Chris O'Hare, running at 1500 m, is another Scottish to follow, having had a very good season including British Team tries and victories at the Year's return Games.
Doyle recalls his first championship when the only other Scottish in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says he is "very proud" of the move, in which many hemispheres will not only enter the team but in some cases compete for a medal and struggle to reach the finals.
"The special part of being a team captain was with the votes given by other members of the team, so it was already a huge honour, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you made it extra special for me," he added.
He said: "I'm proud of all the Scotland who have come into the team.
It shows how far we've got to go.
And they are here, as self-proven athletes, as athletes who have stepped up to make it to the podium.
When it comes to the Captain's speech?
Yes, I think it went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we are very lucky in this situation, in my view, that there is a World Championship that is in our house.
So, in this reality, we are only successful with the impact of being able to take advantage of this infield support and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I've got a second chance to get out there and fight and it's going to be such a wonderful atmosphere out there, "he said.
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Running for state office if you can't afford voters' criticism
The father of our country had some information about negative media coverage.
Americans seated George Washington, but it didn't take too long for newspapers to start sharply criticising him about everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course, he was irritated by the criticism.
But it didn't silence those who criticized him.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "freedom of speech can be eliminated, and we can be stupid and silent and dragged to shore."
It brings me to Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, who needs to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the shares of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union also sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff didn't care about the case on the grounds that it was serious, and the online comments were filled with responses from "who cares?"
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But that's important.
When it comes to someone like Hogan, that's especially important.
This is a Republican governor who is stunningly popular in a province that is overwhelmingly Democratic.
It has the second highest liquidation rate among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a gerrymandering crazy phrase.
He has shown mastery in leading his province and in his strict commitment to principles.
He was also highly skilled at using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his voters, with his post-chemotherapy haircut wearing his head shirtless.
So it's unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people coming to the governor's page, which is a public forum, formally described and run by members of the public's staff who are paid tax dollars.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's female spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's input, claiming that blocking the comments was nothing more than regulating them.
But it's very easy to use images of trolls or spam-makers or hateful people making online verbal salutes.
The Post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people who speak only to their elected leaders: A teacher, a workplace owner and a pontiff; not Control.
They all said their comments were not respectful, thoughtful and defiant.
In his exchange, the pontiff addressed Hogan's Catholic faith, posting a quote from the Bible.
Lakshmi sarma Ramani, a lawyer from Maryland Bowie, was not hateful, but asked about hate crimes.
"Naively, I made the comment that I was disappointed that he was unresponsive to hate crimes and other recent reports," he wrote in the commentary section of The Post's reporting.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same issue, it should be ignored by some as a collective effort, rather than by a large group of anxious citizens," he said.
Others, whom the governor's staff called an "intensified spam attack," would probably call an "advocate for ideas."
The Facebook era facilitates the convenience of a message by blocking a dissident or deleting a negative message.
It is much cleaner than in the old days, when staff were sent outside to collect and burn newspapers where there were critical articles, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that's exactly what happens, even if it's digital.
Hogan is not the first public post to be criticized for ineffective Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being taken to court by Twitter users who have been blocked in his Twitter flow.
One of the decisions that could be a future reference to this issue came from Virginia last week.
The chair of the Loudoun Administration District's Board of auditors acted in violation of the First Amendment when he banned a voter on Facebook, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria.
Also in Kentucky, V. Matt Bevin (Republican) was visited by the ACLU because of his Facebook and Twitter use.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington time, the reasonably priced postal transfer had a pretty similar effect on the interiors.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled to four, and the anonymous letter writers overstepped his lead.
Even then, Washington had the unknown Control.
People using nicknames such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to the newspapers that put Washington's decisions under their feet.
According to the online George Washington articles Project, which has collected historical documents, petitions critical of his standing on the Friendship, Trade and Travel Agreement with Britain have bungled his office.
But it didn't silence them.
Freedom of expression, opposition and duplication are on the very basis of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes his home at Renaissance Club will be in relief
Ronan Rafferty, a former European number one, hopes his home will be in relief over the next three days as he hosts the 25th edges of the Renaissance Club, Scottish Senior Open in South Lothian.
The Northern Irish, who reached the final by leading the next door before losing to Paul Eales at Archerfield links, feel committed to the new venue and act as an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of Jerry Sarvadi, the founder and CEO of the tower.
"I watched the construction of the Renaissance Club and with this organisation we see it getting statewide," Rafferty said.
The players will see the pitch in its best form, in a frenetic situation.
Jerry set up this place and did a frenetic job.
He is an undaunted advocate of this game and is proud of his success here.
That's a great show for this pitch.'
Britain's Eales has won both the Europen Tour and the European Challenge Tour but will struggle to maintain a title for the first time in his 32-year career.
"It feels really special," the Southport-based player said.
"I didn't have a chance to protect the Extremadura Open because it was removed from my schedule the following year when I won.
It's very nice to go back to this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
Memories from last year are canceled, and for me and my wife Sharon, winning last year was very special.
It was very special and a time when we would always be remembered for love. "
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year, is also making a comeback to the game on his own.
This event will be the first Scotland competition since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always makes a little bit more sense when you're struggling at home," Helensburgh Man Orr said.
"You want to do well, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and playing drastic golf.
I am happy with the progress so far. "
Participants in this trio on the field are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior Major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the 6 Scottish on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Attendance is free and there is parking; £5 per vehicle where a person is, and £10 per vehicle where there are two or more people.

I found the response
Think of a "seat"... The Budget is more than the budget allocated to each of the ten ministries, including the Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science Industry and Technology, Environment and Childhood, Health, Culture and Tourism Ministries, with 6,867 million Turkish lira.
The number of personnel is 117,378.
Turkey's largest "propaganda base!"
Yes, I'm talking about the Office of Religious Affairs!
Yes, I'll talk about the head of Religious Affairs, Mehmet Gormez!
For days... I'm looking for answers to the question in my Caucasian...
I wonder the real reason for Mehmet Gormez's removal from the post...
I read every article that came out about her being sent.
It doesn't exist.
I can't find any way to answer the question I've got.
Just at the beginning of this year...
Mehmet Gormez has drafted the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan of the Office of Religious Affairs (DIB).
A 1m-euro S 600 model Mercedes was pulled under by President Erdogan.
I mean, he had no problem with Erdogan.
What happened?
You can say, "Is it enough to have been in office for seven years?"
The first DIB president, M. Rifat insect, served for 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz, who you all know, sat in that seat for 11 years.
So... the president's mandate is clear.
I return to my question again: Why did Mehmet Gormez leave his post?
Business has fallen to a head...
Shiite closeness
The source close to the power said: "According to the infamous uproar, Mehmet Donmez did not have his own skin!"
The code of this sentence is: He didn't have the Suns!
The person who made the cake said on his back: "Modernist was found by the Secondary ulema!"
So, Mehmet Gormez was seen as innovative.
What was it about innovation?
The answer was that Mehmet Gormez was hiding on a trip abroad.
Date: December 27, 2015.
Mehmet Gormez travelled to Iran to attend the 29th Vahdet Conference in Tehran -- aimed at bringing Islamic denominations closer.
He met with Iran's religious leader, Ayetullah Ali Hamaney.
He stood with Shi'ite clerics and prayed.
And he said at the conference: "The denominations are the five religious sites that have been created over time, representing different ideas and beliefs in understanding the Islamic religion."
The aim of all is to determine the exodus up to God.
Each is a tale road distance that leads to the main road, but where they arrive is the same.
It is never acceptable to mirror the sectarian religion, or to see a member of the sect above the Islamic aids.
Secrecy-based segregation is a reflection of kissing and conflict taasis and ignorance.
It has been the religion itself that has suffered the most in the way that the Cemeteries have been in front of religion...
I want to highlight it again by underlining here:
Shiites and Sunnis are one hope...
"No one can single out someone else for not being able to alter and live as he understands Islam himself," he said.
A year later...
Only Cafe leader Selahattin Ozgun from Turkey attended the 30th Vahdet Meeting.
So...
The Vehicles, not the Sunnis
Mehmet Gormez's trip to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of "traditional uprisings."
It was that no one - again - would attend the next Tehran conference, representing the Turkish State.
Already, Mehmet Gormez has not received an invitation four times since taking office.
The reason was clear; the Shiite - anti-Iran "traditional ulema!" In the DIB.
Starting in early 2016, immediately after his trip to Iran, Mehmet Gormez's seat began to slump.
At the beginning of this was Deputy Prime Minister Numan liberty, who was in charge of the FIF -- at the turn!
Mehmet Gormez was so drowned that he wanted "to be connected to the Presidency of the DUP."
At the core of the job...
Within the state, there was a difference in the view of Sunnis.
Some "traditional ulema," whose theoretical worlds were created in Saudi Arabia and Egyptian medallists, depicted Sunnis - in the shadow of the United States - as Vehhabi-Selefilik!
These were Iranian opponents who didn't even tap into the trip to Tehran.
His remarks about Mehmet Gormez were not surprising. "There was no danger of this happening to the Religious Community," he said.
"Rabbim is a stunning reis Nasip eyeshadow who is committed to the homeland nation and loyal to the Ehlishness," he said.
They were using "Ehlisünneti" as a semiconductor concept of Iranian hostility.
Once made by FEMA - a CIA supporter - the anti-Iran movement was now running new names.
And with the FEMA scams...
A photograph of a teenager holding a visor was served to the media with the words "Mehmet Gormez's son!"
Ah what a coincidence!
Who made the biggest opposition to Mehmet Gormez in the media: Turkey, the newspaper of the US-led Islamic Community!
After all...
- resisting not bringing Sunnis to the Saudi Vehhabi-segregated line...
- that doesn't fuel sectarian segregation...
- modernist... a cleric whose consciousness was destroyed by the "traditional ulema" created during the Cold War...
The US cultural emperor continues to rapidly Arab Turkey (making it a Vehhabi-predecessor).
You will have no doubt that the President of the future Religious Affairs will be a representative of the Vehhabi-predecessor!
"We support Turkey's protection of sovereignty."
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was in China for an official visit.
At the State Congress in Beijing, the capital, Cavusoglu and Chinese Foreign Minister Vang yi held a joint press conference.
"We hope that Turkey will be more actively involved in international issues," Vang said.
China will support Turkey in its efforts to maintain sovereignty, stability and security.
"We hope that with regard to Palestine, it will be resolved with the international community, including Turkey," he said.
For his part, Cavusoglu said of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, "Turkey, in its pursuit of close business with regional and international organisations, is a complement, not an alternative to each other."
Spirituality officially begins its second term
Hasan Ruhani's presidency, which won Iran's presidential election in May, was approved by the country's leader, Ayetullah Ali Hamaney.
Hasan Ruhani, who was elected president for the second time in Iran, was sworn in at a ceremony attended by the country's religious leader, Ayetullah Ali Hamaney.
Turkish Ambassador to Tehran Riza Hakan Tekin attended the ceremony, which was attended by senior military and political figures as well as representatives of foreign countries.
Ruhani, who will serve for another four years as president, will be officially inaugurated on Saturday (August 5th) after a swearing-in ceremony in parliament.
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci, representing Turkey, is expected to attend the ceremony.
Security measures at Cilvegli Border Patrol
The passage of trucks carrying supplies other than humanitarian aid, food, medicine, cleaning materials will not be tolerated from the Cilvegli Border Patrol in Hatay's Reyhanli district.
Due to adverse security conditions at the Babel Air Border Patrol and in the area near the Turkish border, the Cilvegli Border Patrol has been closed to shipments other than humanitarian aid, food, medicine and cleaning materials, according to sources.
The exit of aid trucks from the Cilvegli Border Patrol is permitted.
No information has been released on how long the limit will last.
A Faculty and Death in Indonesia's Golden Age
Bardina Degei doesn't use oats while repairing food.
He even rarely uses a cap.
The housewife is in Papua, Indonesia's restive region, at her wooden home in Enarotali, in the Paniai namesake, where she puts a sweet potato, usually known locally as "notoriety," directly over the Amendment.
Half an hour later, the knife is taken and the appetite is written off and suffocated, the hands have not been washed.
Degei sits on the muddy ground, where she does anguish things like washing up with cloudy water from the nearby swamp, with no furniture at all.
A kova in the disgraced house serves as a pitch helmet.
As the youngest of her husband's four Cardinals, she was never given a job in any field.
The discovery is a regular here.
Of course, it can be dangerous to work until late: Most of the men in the village are unemployed and most drink a lot, and there are soldiers.
"No one is walking in the village after 5pm," she said.
In 1969, after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elderly people were forcibly removed and forced to vote as umumi before the units invaded, a former Dutch colony absorbed by Indonesia is a rare insight into everyday life in the mountainous areas of Papua.
An existing movement that propagates independence against the Dutch leadership quickly directed its anger at the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, banning foreign journalists or rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the region was officially designated as Papua and West Papua, in a way that independent Papua New Guinea would occupy the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is remote; the journey here includes a 90-minute flight from the regional capital, Jayapura, to Nabire, and a 5-hour drive that mixes with a rental vehicle.
There is no public transport.
The 19.000-square-foot bell contains wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, with burnt iron roofs converted by bystanders into a variety of crisp brown tones.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, have traveled there and virtually no foreigners have traveled there.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, he taped Mee Pago Papuans to a god named Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," Degei says, referring to her vibrant colourful, get-in-touch heels, sheer skirt and bright eteenth.
"In advance, we would just wear make-up to our body," she said.
Papua, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have the worst shepherd death and literacy rates in Asia, is Indonesia's poorest region.
But at the same time, this is Indonesia's golden bottom.
Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just 60 miles away from Paniai, a mountainous area on the scale of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport removed $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from it.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
But these attractions, a source of misery for Papuans, allow Indonesia's powerful military to maintain a straightforward presence.
The New York Times research in 2005 reports that Freeport paid about $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including sums of up to $150,000 given to a single officer.
Papuans' call for more automation threatens this golden egg chicken and comes from their mercurial rights.
More than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned, according to rights activists.
In the mountainous parts of Papua, mass killings in the 1970s reached genocide figures, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful demonstrators in the area last year alone.
The Archdiocese of Brisbane's 2016 report, "We will lose everything," includes testimony of sectarian crimes committed the previous year, including unlawful executions, torture (according to another report, death by rape and electricity is particularly popular) and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to calculate the number of victims because there are incidents every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Pressure has been heightened as Papua's resources have brought settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The region's population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as muddy migrants from Indonesia's crowded islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi come for economic purposes.
Javid warung breads sell gado-gado, served with ground fat sauce mixed with fried chicken and vegetables.
Locals are finding it hard to compete.
"Immigrants sell chicken and vegetables more cheaply in traditional markets than locals," explains Abeth You, 24, a resident of Paniai, who moved to the regional capital of Jayapura for a job.
"This has caused local Papuans to lose the market of their Papuvian Mama-Mama (women)," she said.
Indonesian president Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, vowed during his 2014 election campaign to address inequalities and rights abuses in Papua.
The former maroon was on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, where he won the vote of 27 of Papua's 29 regions, including Panaia.
But little has changed in Papua, and today locals feel alright.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in anticipation that he would carry out our hope that justice would be restored," You said.
In fact, Paniai experienced his worst situation just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children injured two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike while singing Christmas songs in front of a festive fire in Enarotali outside.
Fearful children told them they should open their fares.
One of the soldiers was inside their base and, according to local pontiff Yavedt Tebai, later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses said the soldiers, who had taken alcohol, chased the group and beat them with the footprints of their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers fired at the boy's group.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he got into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government election commission building was set on fire and incidents escalated the next day.
Up to 1,000 Papua men, women and children gathered to demand justice at a football field outside the local police station and military command centre.
They were carrying ceremonial pilgrims and performed the waita dance of Papua's Mee Pago tribe (by running in public and wearing a bird knife).
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and the military guard.
As the nerves escalated, the troops were ordered by dawn radio. "If the crowd showed more than three hours of resistance, they shot and killed them," Time quoted an unnamed official as telling local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the head of the Kego koto neighbourhood in Enarotali, saw the approaching danger and called on the crowd to return home, demanding calm.
No one had any intention of listening.
"When I turned around, I was shot by multiple left-handed knocks," he explained to TIME at the presentation of his wooden house, which was painted with bright colours.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from a collected military error
"It was horrible, it was fired a lot of times," he adds.
Local Alfius Youw was hit on three occasions, according to his cousin, who was shocked by the attacks.
Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, is known only by one name, explained gloomily to TIME, "I ran into him and examined his body to make sure he wasn't."
"I saw him die... I kissed him," she said.
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers had only "secured" the station because the station was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," branch Director Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for Papua police, said in 2015.
"It's a matter of my death," he said.
Five young protesters were killed and many were injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
News of the deaths reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a euphoric speech in Jayapura in which he said he shared the pain of the victims' families and vowed to solve historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, and not again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he had set up a non-criminal mechanism for historical human rights violations.
But the predators started almost immediately.
"Most of the negatives were a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and some in the early 2000s.
The issue is that we are committed to solving these violations, but there are processes that we have to go through, "he said.
Speaking to TIME on June 5, Wiranto hit back, saying there was no plan to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It will all be resolved by law."
Wiranto, whom the B.M. has accused of "crimes against humanity" involving more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai case, had already been resolved.
Families of the Paniai victims have greeted such claims with bitter scepticism.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," Yohanes said.
"I was tired," she said.
Years later, he says, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," she said.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the soldier, I'm afraid of being shot," he said.
His brother, Yacobus, repeats the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by a soldier after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the Naughters, the soldier came to look for me," she said.
Yet the attacks have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police in Paniai's neighbour Deiyai namesake fired at villagers.
One person was killed and 17 others, including children, were injured during a clash between villagers and the director of a construction company that refused to help bring an unaccompanied man to hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned in a nearby lake while fishing, died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company's sheriff's office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd and killed someone.
"We were very panicked, we feared that revenge would be taken," Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives close to the hospital and whose injuries were raised, tells TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days," she said.
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the mobile police brigade to withdraw from the area.
Paniai has always been a troubled region for the Indonesian government.
The persistence of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the people of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live scattered along Papua's green mountainous centre.
Many have joined the insurgent army Free Papua Movement (OPM), which claims to protect the rights of Papuans by carrying out random attacks and carrying out kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some high-ranking OPM leaders, including Julius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, are from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and kept arbitrary in recent years by soldiers under the knife of "protecting national sovereignty."
Some never see it again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as a "tragic and forgotten place."
The Faculty is beset by dissatisfaction.
The azure rice, which is on sale in Enarotali, is too expensive for landlords to buy.
Bread cannot be reached.
People here grow everything they eat: Basically the note, as well as some fruits and make-up vegetables.
Farming is the work of women who can indulge in sweet potatoes with four or five tarts.
They usually hide most of the damage for the family, and sell the rest on the local market.
The 10 notes contain just 10,000 Indonesian rupiahs (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between local Papuans and new migrants who have come in more numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
Jobs that are already few usually go to immigrants who are better educated and richer.
Papuans have very rarely had their capitalism or the necessary qualifications to run their own business as competitive.
"Young people have no interest in staying in the village because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Panai cabin council.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
Other than that, the limits of reporting for the international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua for "lack of co-ordination with the relevant institutions," despite a rare follow-up to the video.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's campaign promises to lift the limits on reporting and develop to improve transparency have not been carried out.
One bee said: "There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to make news from Indonesia's restive east-end villas, Papua and West Papua: Visa rejection and blacklisting."
The lack of press oversight means international pressure on the Indonesian government is often limited to its neighbours just near Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands) encouraged the B.M. Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries historically support the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir did not care about the group's claims, telling reporters in Jakarta that "the democratic system in Indonesia is still valid and there is free media so the evidence in human rights cases is hard to cover."
Locals want more foreign governments to be interested.
When an official Dutch delegation visited Jayapura on May 4th, chaired by the country's human rights envoy, Kees Van Baar, local residents broke their silence with the phrase "We want Freedom," according to a source who attended the meeting and did not want to be named.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say it's unlikely they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai attack," says Gobai, head of the cabin council.
Jokowi wants the people of Paniai to know that, apart from living under the imminent threat of the Zorba soldier, he has been rounded up in a poor state of emergency with his coveted education and health services.
Like other Papuans, Gobai says, Paniai people see their own vote as a "debt" they have been given to pay back to Jokowi.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," she said.
Despite the threats and scares, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack have carried out a final symbolic counter-act: Burying a victim's body on land opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice can never be fulfilled, they will at least make sure those responsible do not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said, with his head raised.
"What else can we do?" He said.
Fire engulfs Dubai's' Mashale 'skyscraper for second time
A fire in Dubai on Friday ravaged the world's tallest residential towers and forced hundreds of residents to flee the 79-storey structure, which is 337 metres long.
This is the second major fire to spread rapidly into the high building, dubbed the Mashale tower, in two years.
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported and no explanation has been made for the cause of the major fire.
"We were asleep and we woke up to the fire alarms, people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us around 10 minutes to reach the 50th floor, "a caller who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said the fire team had extinguished the large blaze around 4 (00:00 GMT) on the ground local time and were cooling the building.
The government said it was trying to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident could reopen questions about the safety of material used on the outskirts of high buildings worldwide.
The torch management's investigation following the 2015 fire found that most of the damage was in the cover-up -- external panels used for dehydration and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believe the isolation and cover panel system on London's Grenfell Tower, where 80 people died, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire there.
More than 4,000 chronic patients hailed 'social help'
In the first stage, 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients will benefit from the social assistance programme, which will be launched by the Ministry of Family and Social Policies for poor citizens and their families battling chronic diseases.
Through the assistance programme, the ministry plans to provide patients with monthly support of more than two-thirds of the minimum wage, and will provide regular psychosocial support.
According to sources, the details and implementation of the "New Social Assistance Programme for families battling chronic diseases," which began work recently under the orders of Family and Social Policies Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, have become clear.
The social assistance programme, launched with the Ministry of Health to support citizens who are struggling with chronic diseases in their labour union and face economic and psychological difficulties, is the first of its kind in the world.
The ministry has completed all preparations for the launch of the programme and will provide regular psychosocial support to families, not only for transplants, through the social assistance programme.
It aims to ensure that poor citizens and their families, who suffer from chronic illness and continue their treatment at home, are not left alone, both financially and morally.
According to studies, the first stage will provide regular psychosocial and transplant support as part of the new social assistance programme for poor citizens battling Subakut Sklerozan Panensefalit (SSPE), a brain disease caused by tuberculosis and schizophrenia.
Later in the programme, poor citizens battling other rare and risky diseases will be included in the assistance programme.
In addition to the planned support of more than two-thirds of the minimum wage, additional payments could be made to tuberculosis patients identified by the health unit, who are unable to afford medical self-care, continue their lives as dependent on bed, or need to improve home living conditions.
In order to benefit from the support, the household's monthly income per capita is required to be less than two-thirds of the monthly net salary.
It also requires that citizens with SSPE patients be provided with a health board report based on the procedures and guidelines set out in the "Directive on the measurement, Class, and Health Board Report on Productivity."
More than 1 in 5 US passengers bring banned substances to plane, survey finds
According to the survey of airline passengers, more than 20 per cent, knowingly or unknowingly, missed banned substances on the plane from US Transportation Security Agency checkpoints, including at least 6 per cent carrying banned knives or other sharp objects without knowing it.
Less than 1 per cent later claimed to have noticed a mistaken ride with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
Research by the jet rental service Stratos Jet Charters, conducted with more than 1,000 people, also found that younger passengers were more prone to breaking the rules.
Among the participants who admitted to trying to fly knowingly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were from y-birds, compared with less than 15 per cent of X-generation members.
The most general ingredients, knowingly abducted from TSA agents, are food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowing they had undergone sharp alerts from safety, while 2.2 per cent of female participants and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also admitted they were carrying banned drugs knowing about the plane.
The firm said it had surveyed passengers across the country to find out how many people had mistakenly brought illegal goods from airport security, and how many of them had done so knowing.
It is no surprise that the most likely people to pass illegal goods out of security, knowing or not, are the most likely to fly.
Yet, as the firm notes, the TSA rules are a piece of wetter and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids or how much they can carry from them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of substance confiscated by the TSA has emerged as banned liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might be treating the books as illegal goods.
Foreigners are allowed on domestic flights, but are not allowed in international ones.
China welcomes US statements
Chinese Foreign Minister Vang yi said at a news conference in the capital, Beijing, that Tillerson was referring to the Pyongyang administration as saying: "We are not seeking an excuse for the change of the Reef, the collapse of the regime, the rapid reunification of the peninsula and sending our troops north of the 38th parallel."
Chinese Foreign Minister Vang said Tillerson re-emphasized the Washington administration's principles on the North Korea issue, adding that he hoped the United States would implement these principles effectively and in a policy focused on concrete results.
Noting that the security of the Korean peninsula is a priority, Vang said he expects the parties to find the middle way in which they can resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, and stressed that the Beijing administration has been adamant since the end of the year that the peninsula should be demilitarised, that peace and stability must be maintained, that problems should be resolved through dialogue and negotiation.
EPA Chief Pruitt Wants to Name Obama Duty Emission reduction laws
A day after it was sued by 15 counties, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, reversed an earlier decision to delay enforcement of Obama-era laws that cut air polluting emissions that caused pill smoke.
Pruitt represented change with his own organization being more sensitive to the needs of county environmental regulators than past administrations.
He never mentioned the subject of a legal appeal against his own previous position in a federal supreme court.
What is at stake is that counties are starting to meet October 1, the end of 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt had announced to his own organization that he would delay compliance by one year in June to give the plan more time to work and avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's provincial attorney general before he was appointed by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable ally against stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has moved several times to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change is Pruitt's latest legal defeat for his agenda of reversing the arrangement.
Last month, a federal supreme court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator's attempt to delay the practice, which demanded that oil and gas companies, an Obama administration law, oversee and reduce methane leaks, exceeded the limits of his own authority.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt said the reversal of ozone standards strengthened the EPA's commitment to only meet new standards with counties in time and work through complex processes.
Pruitt, who has sued the EPA on more than a dozen occasions in his previous job, said: "Under previous administrations, the EPA would often fail to meet the final deadlines of decisions, waited to be sued by activist groups and others, and would have been happy to resolve the dispute to arrange the timing for the decision."
"We do not believe in organising through a trial, and we take the dates of the term seriously.
We will also take seriously the law and the authority it gives us. "
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt could use "delay authority and all other authority that is legally available" once again at some point to ensure the regulations are "supported by robust policies and the best information available."
Congressional Republicans are pressing for a broader rewrite of ozone laws.
A House bill approved last month struggles to delay implementation of the 2015 laws by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to the Senate for a vote.
Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general who led the coalition of counties that sued the EPA this week, said the group was intent on maintaining legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: "Following our trials, the EPA's change of decision is a significant win for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the pile of smoke flowing into their communities."
The case involved New York from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone occurs when general pollutants are endemic by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical facilities and other sources that react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting pill smoke can cause serious breathing problems in a group of people who are quickly affected and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applauded Pruitt's surprise decision change.
Lori Ann Burd, of the Centre for biological Diversity, said: "It is disturbing that so much pressure is needed to achieve this righteous step from the person tasked with protecting the air that we find."
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological struggle to encroach on environmental pollutants and interest groups," he said.
Inflation is the only household
Turkey, which saw its biggest increase in exports in 6 years in July, brought its unemployment rate to 10.5 per cent in April from 13 per cent last year, and its economic confidence index rose to a 3.5-year high, bringing inflation down to a single digit.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.15 per cent in July, while annual inflation fell to a single digit for the first time since the octagon, at 9.79 per cent, according to data released by the Turkish Statistical Institute (CPI) yesterday.
As of the main spending groups, the highest month-on-month increase was in the group of restaurants and hotels, at 1.75 per cent, while the largest drop was in clothing and footwear, at 3.51 per cent.
The highest year-on-year increase was in the transport group, at 15.24 per cent.
"The moderate audience in inflation has been influenced by the drop in the prices of food and clothing groups," said Business Investment Economist Muammer Koumoutsakoglu, noting that inflation has dropped to a single digit, in line with expectations.
Unlike the headline in core indicators, however, there is a rise compared to the previous month.
"We don't expect there to be a relaxation in the hard standing of the Central Bank," he said.
Despite the drop in headline inflation, there has been a rise in core inflation indicators.
The B index of specific CPI indicators, also closely monitored by the Central Bank, rose from 9.07 per cent to 9.46 per cent, and the C index rose from 9.20 per cent to 9.60 per cent.
"Inflation could fluctuate by December and fall to a single digit in December," said Digital FX Research Deputy Director Enver Erkan, adding that inflation could close at 9.3 per cent this year.
"The Central Bank may get an opportunity as of the first months of 2018," he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek: Inflation will close the year in a single digit.
Central Bank tightening will continue until inflation falls below 7 per cent.
We will give the final shape to reforms at the nearby Food Committee.
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci: We are delighted that inflation has fallen to a single-digit figure, but it needs to become permanent.
The fight against inflation requires lower food prices, as well as increased supply.
Development Minister Lutfi Elvan: There may be some upward trend in annual inflation due to the bump effect in the coming months, but the drop in inflation from the first months of 2018 will be decisive.
We estimate that annual inflation will be even lower.
I wish Fenerbahce success in their next game.
Sturm Graz Technical Director Franco Foda said their performance in the second half was not enough to kick off the tour, as they drew 1-1 with Fenerbahce in the UEFA Europa League 3rd qualifying round.
Speaking at a press conference after the match, Foda said Fenerbahce were a top-level team, adding: "We couldn't use the wings in the first half."
We set the balance in the game in the second half.
We had a chance for the second goal.
I'm still proud of my team.
They changed the flow of the game in the second half.
We could have been a little bit better.
In the game, small things were decision-making.
"I wish Fenerbahce success in their next game," he said.
Foda said that as long as they are in Turkey, they feel very good and are also happy with the misogyny they see.
Fernando in Istanbul
Brazilian football player Fernando Francisco Reges, who started the transfer talks with the Galatasaray Club, arrived in Istanbul.
Fans cheered the Brazilian footballer, who arrived at Ataturk Airport.
Fernando, whose yellow-clad fans showed love with cheers, walked into the private vehicle waiting for him under security and left the airport.
Fernando, 30, who started his career in Vila Nova, Brazil, playing for Estrela Amadora, Porto and Manchester City, is in midfield.
The Brazilian is expected to sign a contract with the yellow jersey team after undergoing a medical.
Galatasaray, who are continuing their transfer work, have agreed a £5,250,000 deal with Manchester City for Fernando, who they have long sought to add to their squad.
US flagship Rakka move: Homeland Security Force...
Colonel Dillon, who was connected to the US Department of Defense (Pentagon) with video conference management from Baghdad, said the coalition-trained Rakka Homeland Security Force (RIGG) had begun to relocate to areas in the city that had been cleared of DEA.
"The Rakka Homeland Security Force, composed mostly of Arabs and local anti-DEA volunteers in the cleared areas of the city, continues to maintain order and prevent terrorists from fleeing or returning," Dillon said.
Another 230 people have completed their training and joined the group this week, Dillon said, adding that "for the time being, there are 850."
The coalition has trained the group on basic weapons training, as well as on first aid, armed conflict, screening and checkpoint operations, Dillon said.
Citing the high level of interest in the Rakka Homeland Security Force, Dillon said the coalition would continue to monitor those applying for education and employment.
The US-led coalition is co-operating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, which are the main shoulder of the PYD / PKK in taking Rakka.
The PYD / PKK terrorist group has appointed a PKK terrorist, Leyla Mohammed, as co-chairman of the Rakka civilian government council.
Members of the PKK / PYD are also alleged to be part of the military force in Rakka.
Dillon also announced that the US-led coalition had collected heavy weapons from the opposition group Karyateyn (Shauhuk) in the Shia in the al-Tanif camp in southern Syria, where it cut its support last week.
"After meeting with their leaders last week, Shuhuk brought back the heavy weapons and equipment that the coalition had given them, but some small weapons and light vehicles were allowed to remain in them," Dillon said.
Last week, the United States said it was pulling its support from Shuhuk because it was out of the conflict zones it had agreed on with Russia and was patrolling and conducting activities that were not related to the fight against the DEA.
In addition to the DEA, the group is said to be seeking to fight against the regime of Bashar al-Assad.
Trump pressured Mexico to pay for a border wall, according to leaked phone call notes.
Notes of phone calls between US president Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
In a phone call with Mexico's president, Enrique Pena Nieto, on January 27, Trump squeezed him over his failure to publicly say he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The US president rebuked the president of Mexico, who held the wall open to the public, and said, according to rumors, "You can't say it to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign on building a wall along the southern border of the United States and promised Mexico he would pay for the project.
Notes of his first meeting with Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, which revealed a heated dialogue, were also published.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull that the US agreement on getting refugees to travel to Australia was "masterful," "chilling" and "stupid" and that the deal under Obama after offering a ban on relocating a refugee to the US would show him like "Budala."
"This was the most naïve speech I've ever had all day," Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull, terminating the speech.
Patient relatives break doctor's neck
Doctors and employees of Turkey's High Identity Education and Research Hospital walked off their short-term jobs last morning in response to the daring of a doctor's friends by their sick relatives.
Crowds gathered outside the hospital's main entrance with banners reading "No to violence in health," reacting to the incident.
"The slogan 'no to violence in health' seems to me to be inadequate or even an entity slogan," said Dr. Feyza Aydikur Pac, director of the hospital's Children's Cardiology Clinic.
In health, there can be no place for words of violence.
"If it goes that way, these people are in the face that they won't find a health guru who will soon be self-serving," he said.
The medics' action was supported by Ankara City Health Director Dr Kamil Turkmen, Ankara First District Public hospitals General-Secretary Dr Oner Odabas, Turkey's Higher Education and Research Hospital's chief medical officer, Dr Mustafa Paç, and patient relatives in the hospital yard.
Condemning the incident, he said:
Unfortunately, violence against healthcare professionals is increasing.
We reexperienced an example of this incident yesterday (the previous day), when our cardiovascular surgery dentist was coughed up by a patient.
We are demanding an increase in the vulnerability of our people, even though we are taking the measures we can as our state, ministry and governor to ensure that these incidents end as soon as possible.
I condemn yesterday's events on behalf of my hospital and health workers.
"Unfortunately, it has become a professional complication that we have experienced from time to time," Odabas said, noting that society needs to raise awareness of health violence.
"We will take our own measures, but the most important thing is that our nation has its own health worker," he said.
Turkmen said the judicial process is under way. "Our laws on violence in health have been implemented effectively enough," he said.
The ranks of the state are implementing it.
Currently, the police are working.
In the past, these have always been vacant, but at the moment there is a direct public case and the state appoints a lawyer, following the case.
"There are also severe examples of punishment that have been taken in relation to this," he added.
In the wake of the revelations, employees continued to work.
The alleged incident happened at about 17.45pm the previous day.
Relatives of the patient, who died in intensive care, attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Ozbek, who worked in the Heart and Damar Surgery department, who reported his death.
He was taken away from the scene by doctors and assistants; police were called to the hospital.
Uzbek's Burnu was framed in the incident and the attackers were taken into custody.
A doctor, a witness to the incident, said:
When our friend went to the patient's relatives to report the condition of a patient who died, patient relatives blamed our friend and us for the situation and attacked two of our friends.
Our friend's Burn was broken, he was in the chest.
Then we took our friend into the ameliorator and hid it.
For 15 to 20 minutes, the security set-up was on the hunt.
If sick relatives had crossed that safety wall, there would have been much worse things.
Heavy blow to DEA in Gaziantep: 102 wickets...
The investigation, which is being conducted by the Gaziantep State Prosecutor's Office, found 5,100 kilograms of amonium nitrogen in 102 cans used for making explosives as a result of an operation by the Gaziantep Police Directorate's Counter-Terrorism Directorate into a store designated to be owned by the terrorist group DEA in the Kayaonu neighbourhood.

YPG looting in Syria...
US intervenes
YPG terrorists have looted the homes of residents of the resort of Tel Semin in the northern countryside of Rakka, where US military support has entered on the grounds of fighting the terrorist group DEA, AA said, citing local sources.
The reaction of civilians whose homes were looted and confiscated has turned into clashes with the terrorist group.
US forces in the area then entered the resort with armoured vehicles.
"Cougar MRAP" type laborers, personnel carriers and Husky-type mine-clearing vehicles were found to have formed a buffer zone at the resort.
The terrorist group YPG does not allow civilians fleeing death in Rakka, which has come under fire as part of an anti-DEA operation, to enter cities controlled by it.
The local network of activists, "Rakka is quietly murdered," announced yesterday that 121 civilians were killed in the group's artillery fire in July alone.
Let's not take the fights of the old world to the woods
A belated perception of domestic and world realities could lead to crises not only for people in the region, but for countries as well.
One of the reasons for the belated perception of the world realities of the rest of the East, which we refer to as "Sonism," may be the blocking or real-world announcement of these facts in the geography of the East.
Don Chisinau and Oblomov were the subject of the literary world as well, either by delay or not to perceive change.
Cervantes's "Don Perot" is a mecca that still sang itself into a knife in its return, when its necklace began to form.
Or Goncharov's "Oblomov" is a lazy legacy that, when ignoring the facts, thinks everything can last as long as it used to be.
For example, China was open to the world by the end of the 15th century and was a sovereign country overseas, with a passionate dynasty closing in on the throne.
It has been withheld until the death of the captain of boats that ran out of Chinese land waters.
With one leg, eyes and ear in the West, and the other leg, eyes and ear in the East, we Turks have had constant dilemmas about understanding facts and change, starting with the Ottoman past.
We tried to bring the old, new chapter to date, to understand the present with the concepts that fit the old conditions, and to think about it tomorrow.
As a part of us, we have been able to act as quickly as the think-tanks in developed countries when it comes to understanding the realities at home and around the world, as well as change.
This has been a source of constant clashes, tensions.
Medrese and the university, the newcomer and the modern army, have faced doubts about faith, leading to a dramatic showdown.
The progression is even worse than before, and it was not accepted that the hearings, which were new and advanced at a time, would go ahead at the end of certain periods of time, and that they would be left behind.
After a while, progressives of the world began to declare the new and advanced "Threatened," while those trying to interpret domestic and world conditions in line with the present-day reality were "traitors."
The most important lesson was that in the Ottoman Empire, when those who defied the realities of home and the world by delay dominated thought and state life, empathy dissipated, collapsed, and the people became impoverished.
The most important lesson of our Ottoman past to the Republic was the fact that the world's conjecture and the rapid perception of change are an inevitable precondition for survival.
Since this lesson is very well summed up, we have been an exemplary country of geography that has been able to maintain its unity, integrity and stability in peace since World War I.
We also need to put the crystals behind us and be aligned with reality so that we can survive the global process of change that has entered into a different approach.
In other words, there will be no one to blame for the pointless camping and blood feuds that have led to the toppling of our democracy in the past.
Moreover, in today's world, the smallest mistakes lead to huge and dramatic crises.
The most problematic geography is in the Middle East, where we live.
Historic monument operation in Muirfield
The governor's office said an operation was carried out by City Gendarmerie Command teams on the smuggling of historic monuments.
"As a result of the work, two golden coins, one silver coin, 20 bronze coins, 1 golden bracelet, 2 bronze rings, 1 fragmented glass bracelet, 4 stone obscenities, 8 branches, 1 pink-and-white-coloured stone obsession, 1 painting frame, 23 different pieces of stains and ebbs, and a different colour," the statement said. The covers and pages, deemed to date back to the period 6, were encrypted and some of the pages were painted in Arabic-written Qur'an, along with books, 1 pottery cover, a broken stove, which was deemed to date back to 10 old times, and 1 bronze copper knife, "he said.
"Our operations in the fight against crime and criminals for the peace and security of our people will continue with determination," it said.
Turkey in the wind
Relying on Turkey's future, the global giants struggled with a break in yesterday's wind power tender.
A world record was set in the tender for a model set by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources to ensure the transition to national energy by reducing external dependence.
The tender will reduce Turkey's energy costs, paving the way for $1 billion in investments and close to 4,000 jobs.
By early 2019, domestic production wind turbines will be included in the system.
8 consortium, including US, Chinese, German and Danish giants, participated in the tender for the license of a wind power plant in renewable resource areas (YEKA), which was opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.
Financial bidding envelopes were opened to determine the 5 bidders who originally submitted the lowest bid.
After the initial bidding envelopes, the lowest bid was $4.19 / kWh.
The open-screen range is set at 0.01 cent.
After the tender began, joint venture groups including Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas decided not to participate in the auction.
Groups including Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed in the auction.
MingYang-First Construction and Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon were the last two after the consortium, owned by Nordex, also pulled out.
MingYang-First Construction took the mound 11 times.
The Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon Energy consortium has never used a mile.
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak: It is a record day for Turkey.
The open eclipse continued for 30 rounds.
The winner of the intense competition between the two consortia was the Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon joint venture group, which offered the lowest bid of $3.48 cents / kWh.
The consortium offered $3.49 cents / kWh in the tender, while the tender commission, headed by Deputy Assistant Minister Alparslan Bishtar, withdrew its offer to 3.48.
With the result in the two-hour YEKA competition, Turkey set a world record.
The price offered in the tender was $3.48 / cent per kWh, the lowest in the world.
The previous record was in Mexico's hands at $3.84 / cent per kWh.
Speaking at a press conference following the conclusion of the tender, Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak said the win by the German company Siemens was an important message to the region and the world. "In terms of Turkey and Germany's 200 years of historical co-operation, I think this outcome will contribute significantly to Turkish-German relations," he said.
Our goals are great.
The nexus that emerged today has revealed how robust and confident the economy and the energy market are going into the future.
I am very proud of the fact that, regardless of the regional crises in the world, Turkey has emerged as the most reliable investment destination in the region and the world.
"In this picture, which we will be proud of as much as 80 million people, the greatest contribution is to our president, who, in his 15 years in power and leadership, has taken Turkey to this point," he said.
He said he had launched a new era with the tender, which was open, transparent and competitive. "One of the most important steps of this is the purchase cost of $10.3 / cent per kWh, with a domestic contribution in the wind up to yesterday, with a historic record of $3.48 / cent, with a world record price," he said.
I am proud of that, on behalf of my nation, on behalf of my country.
He said he aims to activate the first domestic production panels in solar energy by the end of 2018, adding: "We will also incorporate our domestic production wind turbines into the system by early 2019."
The turbines will be built in the designated 5 regions.
The winning bidder will launch a total installed force of 1,000 megawatts, with a requirement to build at least 50 megawatts of wind power in each of these 5 regions.
Total investment in the Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon group will be more than $1 billion.
With local wind power plants in operation, a minimum of 3 billion kWh of electric power will be produced each year, and the annual electricity needs of about 1.1 million households will be covered by the wind.
The future wind power facilities will also provide an average of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 / year emissions reduction.
The winning bidder will build a factory with an investment of more than $100 m.
The plant will produce an average of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines, with a capacity of at least 2.3 megawatts.
The consortium will study R & D for 10 years in a total of 5 areas in at least three of the canning, generator design, materials technologies and production techniques, software and innovative feminine box areas.
A budget of $5 m is earmarked each year for R & D work, while 50 technical staff -- 80 per cent of them local engineers -- will be employed.
The plant will be built 21 months after the contract is signed.
The licensing period for the project is 30 years.
Kazim Turker, chairman of the Board of Directors of Turkmen Construction, which was part of the consortium that won the tender, said domestic production would be around 64 per cent, while 35 per cent of the equipment would come from abroad. "We plan to finance the equipment from foreign sources and the rest from domestic banks," he said.
The tender reflects confidence in the Turkish economy, Turker said.
Murtaza Ata, chairman of the Kalyon Holding Energy Group, said "It was a tender that would reduce Turkey's dependence on imports by another 1,000 megawatts."
"We are pleased with the result," he said.
Siemens Gamesa Turkey Senior Manager Hakan Yildirim said they have been operating in Turkey for 160 years. "We will do everything we can to lower the cost of the power unit," he said.
The displacement rate for wind turbines to be produced at the plant will be a minimum of 65 per cent.
Of the 8,000 industrial pieces found in the wind turbine, 65 per cent will be domestic (at least 5,200 pieces).
At least 50MW will be built in each of the 5 regions, with a total capacity of 1,000MW.
A 10-year R & D obligation for employment of 3,750 people will be set aside annually for R & D activities of $5 m.
The 1,000MW Rural Survey 65% Settlement Forest is the production of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines with at least 2.3 MWe power.
More than $1 billion is invested in more than $100 m in the production capacity of 400 MW / year wind turbine annually.
The production of electricity, which will cover the needs of about 1.1 million homes, will produce a minimum of 3 billion kWh of electric power each year, with a reduction of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 / year emissions.
Moore's Ford massacre: Activists Reinvigorate Iron lynching case for Age of justice
A 1948 model Ford Mercury was passed out among a group of spectators in the Monroe Georgia countryside, and it made its way to the small Ford Bridge in Moore with a glimpse of the sounds.
The car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, came forward to cover the path of an armed group of white men before reaching the bridge.
The leader of the gang, a man inside the middle-aged fine-line team elbow, took a long breath from his purse and looked carefully at the inside from the front.
Inside, those sitting were irritated by fear.
"We want it now..... i want it, Roger!" The man yelled.
"The interest from the car is him!" He tweeted.
A young black man was dragged out of the front passenger seat while screaming and screaming.
Fortunately, this horrifying scene on June 22 is only a re-enactment.
But when a mic was thrown around the paint of "Roger," almost everyone from the viewers was quite realistically left.
Since 2005, human rights activists have been returning to the Ford bridge in Moore to revive the lynching of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and MAE Murray Dorsey) by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one has been charged with the killings.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the re-enactment, said: "Although we see them in our communities, it doesn't menace that not a single person has been arrested for all these years, even though we know who they are."
"It's a stain at this time, but it's a burden in our spirits," he said.
At 71, Brooks was a former Georgia state congresswoman and a lifelong human rights activist.
For him, this re-enactment is a call for dramatic action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want to prosecute, we want results, we want the wounds to heal, we want reconciliation, but first we have to achieve justice," he said.
"We can't have the wounds healed and until we get justice for reconciliation," he said.
Criminal Taxation puts a bazaar over the body of one of the victims of the Ford lover in Moore on July 27, 1946.
More than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding areas were suspected of lynching, according to FBI files obtained by NBC News.
But even one has never been investigated.
Although the suspects remained on the run for decades, human rights advocates say the twin motivations of lynchings have always been very well known everywhere in town: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a supreme court ruling made it possible for black citizens in Georgia to vote in a preliminary election for the first time at the end of that summer.
In almost the same cases as the election, according to the FBI, black partner Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white land owner, in connection with a woman apparently during a fight.
Brooks testified that the gossip in town was that Hester was lying with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not from her own husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a leading white land owner, paid $600 to get Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.
Dorothy and her cousins MAE Murray and George Dorsey went to jail at the retreat.
But when they arrived at the Ford Bridge in Moore while driving away from prison, a lingerie gang surrounded the car.
"It is understandable that it was Harrison who arranged and ordered the killings," an FBI report concludes.
"Also, obviously, there was a secret agreement between the provincial and local law enforcement, which not only involved in the murder, but destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses," he said.
Brooks was shorter and self-described.
He said: "This was a massacre of the right to vote."
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and vote, that's what's going to happen to you,'" he said.
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has been leading the revival of the Ford Bridge linebacker at Moore, which takes place annually.
His performance highlights all the details, it's notable, and it's based on a deep kind of racism that many believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch and it's even harder to turn off their look, but Greene says that's the goal.
He said: "We don't want to talk about lingerie because that's what makes our tobacco face the ugliness in our drinks."
"But I can't develop a relationship with the senator if you don't listen to me or listen to what's going on in my head," he said.
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, close to 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest black) packed into a room, and when Greene reluctantly entered the game's well-rehearsed general lines, they listened.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's associate director.
Over the years, he played the role of President Klansman, but says the role has never been convenient.
Marbaugh said: "I feel contaminated because that's not me."
"But I think it's very important to keep this past alive because we don't want to go back to those times," he said.
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester throughout the room, were rehearsing their own dealings.
The game begins with Malcom shouting at Hester, who is very angry that he is lying with his wife Dorothy, and pushing him.
"Z.... i said," Oh, I've stolen from my property, I said! "
Rascona reacts.
There's the sound of a shot.
And then everyone (at least black actors) drops to breakfast.
For the most part, Greene laughs.
"What?!" Rascona asked.
He was amazing, he was surprised.
Have I been serviced a lot?
"No," Greene said in the darkness.
"I just don't think white people were saying z... i at the time," he said.
"Yes," one of the black players said, throwing mixed stones at the sheriff.
"You should push 'R'," he said.
Thus, the energy in the room is changing and some form of sincerity is replaced by discontent.
Everyone is dedicated to doing it right, not only for the fault of the game, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The stage is restarting.
This time, he says the word that started with Rascona N, sharp and shot.
Absolutely no one is laughing.
The re-enactment ends in a violent manner and at speed.
There are screams, gunfire and then silence.
A woman bathed in funeral black stands on the bedrooms of the actors and reads Billie Holiday's hugely methodology, "Garip Meyva."
In one of both words, his voice is broken.
Face Yard is behind an average audience of four, wiping away tears and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost equally divided, in black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many of them from the progression of the road.
While Brooks took them on a holy journey to the graves of Malcom and Dorsey, they were all based on Georgia's oppressive nemesis for almost eight hours.
By this point, the killings had been left as an anecdotes, but now standing in the same place where the lone is, it means the cross is coming like a Landing.
As the final notes of the song weaken, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and examine the bedrooms.
The children wash on their hands, kiss the fake shop and motionless bedrooms, and flirt with each other.
"They never died," a little boy jokes, as if recalling himself.
A few minutes later, Greene is thankful to the crowd and ends multiple times.
The actors take a lingerie thread and wipe away their eyes.
Bradshaw is surrounded by team elder Marbaugh, who plays chairman Klansman.
Nick Rascona is surrounded by two of his player friends and tears are divorced from his eyes on their arm, the emotional cost of the performance comes to him at the end.
"It's not a problem," one of the women laughs.
"We know that's not what's at the heart of the skin.
Do this for a reason. "
Viewers then sit down for dinner with the actors.
At one table, the white couple from Atlanta chatted harshly about reviving with a black couple.
Denise Duplinski found it hard to find words about how the performance made her feel.
He said: "To hear these horrible, bereft words and that behavior... comes out of people who look like snakes and they do them because they look like snakes."
"What this has done to me is make me think that the lynchings are still going on," he said, adding that "only police armed attacks are now being carried out on them."
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks eats at his desk and becomes a focus when he understands human rights moments.
He said he had already started planning next year's performance.
He said: "The revitalisation is inspiring in a sense because it's tarnished what we've been catching up with, but it's also instructive."
"It's like, if you don't learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who do not investigate their own past, those who do not know their own past, are forced to revisit it. "
Myer crash: 4 dead; 6 injured
According to reports, the car with 48 YS 411 license plates, led by Adem Haslam, collided with a car with 09 B 1510 license plates, run by Sinan Senior, at the Kavakliere-Yatakan road Salking post.

The injured Sinan, Senem, Furkan Senior, and Adem, Yilmaz and Abdullah Yigit were taken to the Hospital for Education and Research at Kocman University, as well as to the Yücelen Hospital.
The vital danger of the injuries was found to be ongoing.
As a result of the accident, the road from Yatagan to Kavakliere was closed for a period of time.
Kavakliere Mayor Mehmet Demir and Captain Engin Ocak, commander of the Housing Gendarmerie, also arrived at the scene and received information about the accident.
AK Party's special website for congress
By the AK Party, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the government should
A website called "akconler.com" has been set up for the regular Congressional process.
The website included brochures, material and eyebrows that the party service would use in the process.
In the site's' Communications strategy 'section, the rules that need to be observed in the congressional process were listed on 14 topics.
In a message posted on his website, President and AK Party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned members of the establishment to abide by the party's institutional identity during the congress process.
"Now we are starting a new era of breakthrough," Erdogan said in his message.
We must be renewed and renewed to achieve our 2023 goals with more robust steps.
"We should continue to work hand-in-hand, shoulder-to-shoulder tomorrow as we did yesterday," he added.
To revive business, Pearson makes another 3000 job cuts, cuts profit share
British education group Pearson has begun another restructuring programme to overcome the pressures the business faces, saying it will make another 3000 job cuts on Friday and reduce its occasional profit share by 72 per cent.
As chief executive John Fallon has said, the job cuts, which will mostly come in late 2018 and early 2019, will be in addition to the 4000 positions lost in the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to save another 300 million pounds ($394 million) by experimenting with retiring the business, which is rapidly shifting to digital learning through a third cost-cutting program.
The firm, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said there was no change in the perspective of this year after reporting its basic sales up 1 per cent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half.
Text 2 again took her to death!
Hakan's death is suicide, according to initial findings in a preliminary autopsy report, according to an initial report by the Institute of Criminal Medicine.
A thorough review found no coughing and Cedar traces of the boy's body.
The reason for the suicide is that the elastic bandage he doused in his paint remained needless as a result of his tightness.
The beef, described by his family as Sarc beef, was also found to be the elastic bandaj used in the wound.
After a detailed report on the boy's death was prepared, it was learned that the report, which said the incident was suicide, would be sent to the Metropolitan Prosecutor's Office, which is leading the investigation, newspaper Haberturk reported.
Police are investigating the boy's suicide with all the details, as well as examinations of his computer, which was confiscated after the incident.
Police are also said to have appealed to Hakan's friends.
The information from Hakan's computer, which relatives say was "cleaned up," could also be accessed by third parties or a gang.
Police are looking into whether Hakan may have been driving a suicidal gang.
The certainty that Hakan had committed suicide turned his eyes to the violent Metin2.
Metin2, which was banned from children under the age of 15 by the Antalya Governor's office last year for causing addiction and violence in children, was brought up in 2009 with the murder of Metin Kang, a 13-year-old "mint hacker."
To play Metin2, which was designed in Korea in 2005, it must enter its site and register as a member.
The actors are trying to ensure peace and justice in the world with the Dragon god in the game.
In doing so, there are wars, the dose of violence is on the rise.
The play also features images of war with cutting-edge, delicacy weapons such as venom, swords, pala, balloons, as well as images of people being torn apart by wildcats and their meat defeated.
The actor buys characters with money to strengthen.
The family, who buried their children the following day after the July 25th incident at their home in Esenyurt Istiklal, has continued to claim murder.
"The whole dream was to become a doctor, we don't think it could hurt him or anyone else because of the game," said father Mehmet Ekinci. "They shook the elastic sarcophagus and threw wigs at the side."
It's my son who was found that way.
Certainly, we don't think our son can either commit suicide if you can hurt him and someone else because of a game online.
We were unaware that he was playing a game like that.
It wasn't a game he played haunting.
The bottom line is that when a little cat tightens up, he leaves it out of the game.
Her mother, Gulizar Ekinci, said, "There is no smoke coming into the building."
At a certain hour, my child is said to have entered the house.
None of them hold each other.
When the tree came home, it reached the only seat.
"But when he had his funeral, he had 2 seats next to the computer," he said.
Ilker KARAs: He may have been involved in the gang
In general, families are not paying attention to the issue.
"If my child is at home or whatever it is," they look like.
The child communicates with a lot of people through games.
There may have been a debt-lending situation there, or royalty.
Or, having invited a person in the game home, it may have been a problem between them.
He may have been stuck in an impact not because of the direct play but because of the problems he had with other people he communicated through the game.
He may have seen the spectacle of the game, the frog, the child's real intellect.
The trauma that leads to suicide may be related to blackmail.
There is also a case of being dragged into the bunker because the child could not solve the problem if he faced the situation of being lured into the family.
He can't have committed suicide because of the game itself.
There is also the possibility of the child being bugged into the gang.
He may have been involved in the gang.
Individually, there can be nothing the child could have done alone.
IT systems consultant Füsun NEBIL: Families should know their children's interaction
We cannot say that the Games are harmful.
Research also says the games are useful for children's development.
What's important here is that parents pay attention to what their children play and how they talk to the players online.
Families should know what content children are affected by and take the measure.
There are only 2 children in Turkey in 5 years who are said to have died because of the vote.
This shows that ending a child's life is not just the impact of games.
What was the pain that pushed this child into it?
First, we have to learn about it.
There's a need to look at the sociology and psychology around the child.
Stock market caps 8-month yield at 50 per cent in Istanbul
The BIST 100 index continued the rise trend, which it began in December 2016, in July and moved its rise to 8th in the top tier.
The index thus rose to an 8-month high for the first time since July 2007, rising 45.3 per cent over that period.
The BIST 100 index, which has outperformed the world's major stock markets, including Germany, the United States, Britain, Japan, for its performance since the start of the year, did not leave leadership on a yield basis in July.
The BIST 100 index was up 7.06 per cent in July, followed by the Dow Jones index in the United States, up 2.54 per cent, and the FTSE 100 index in the UK at 0.81 per cent.
The DAX index in alma and the Nikkei index in Japan ended July with a loss of value.
As of January-July, the BIST 100 index showed a high performance from both the major world stock markets and emerging country stock indexes.
The BIST 100 index, up 37.6 percent from its 2016 close this year, was followed by the Dow Jones index, up 10.76 percent, the DAX index with a 5.55 percent gain, the Nikkei index, up 4.55 percent, and the FTSE 100 index, up 3.21 percent.
The MSCI EM index, the benchmark for emerging countries' stock markets, provided a 23 per cent yield.
A look at the historical process of the BIST 100 index showed similar performances in the past.
The BIST 100 index, which most recently finished the 8 months between December 2006 and July 2007 in a row, was up 38.3 per cent during that period.
In addition, the BIST 100 index ended the 8 months between August 1996 and March 1997 with a consecutive gain in the 9 months between May 1997 and January 1998.
Meksa Investment Research Director Eren Can Ümut told an AA reporter that the BIST 100 index has continued to rise for 8 months, noting that since the beginning of the year, the rise has surpassed the 37 per cent level.
The MSCI emerging markets (EM) index has risen 23 per cent, he said, because even when we look at these rates, there is a positive split.
The flow of funds to developing countries has been going on since the beginning of the year.
Funds, especially in the quest for higher yields, prefer countries with higher interest rates.
As such, domestic markets are positively affected.
Of course, the appetite for risk-taking on a global scale is also a stunning one.
In this way, stock market indices, which have risky asset status, are on the rise.
In the United States, the S & P 500 index has risen close to 11 percent since the beginning of the year, and we see new record levels being tested almost every week.
At the start of the year, the US Central Bank's (Fed) estimate of 3 interest rate hikes stung markets, but it eliminated uncertainty by using the Fed's verbal direction policy pretty well, he stressed, noting that the Fed has a market that is insensitive to interest rate hikes.
He said inflation in the United States is not yet at the desired level, while expectations that the Fed will not be accustomed to raising rates and avoid radical moves are also quite effective at current pricing.
He said US President Donald Trump's failure to scrap health care reform, known as "Obamacare," reinforced his perception that he could not deliver on his promises of expansion finance policies, adding: "Thanks to Trump, faster-growing US economy expectations have affected stock market markets for a period of positive effects, but the failure to deliver on promises strengthens the Fed's hand in terms of the response to faster growth and faster inflation, and in this context, the market."
He noted that in terms of Turkish markets, 2016 was a year of many negative trends, and said the BIST 100 index, which was negative and sold overseas, was in an effort to close the gap.
While noting that they have not seen a strong recovery from the flow of domestic news, he said the current outlook could be interpreted mainly as a trigger for an increase in the appetite for risk-taking abroad and a willingness to close the gap based on the similarities of domestic markets.
He said he watched some snow sales in the BIST 100 index, which technically tested new records at 108,600 levels.
In particular, the 109,500-110,000 area is a critical gateway in the short term.
It is normal for snow sales to take place after it approaches these levels.
In the short term, we think that a new local or global story should be created to prioritise 110,000 grapes.
For the time being, a downward spiral of 107,500 support could trigger profit sales.
In this case, if we follow the support of 107,000 people, I think there could be a relaxation of up to 106,000-105,500.
In particular, a fraction of the 105,500 support could lead to a withdrawal of up to 104,300, a level that is comparable to the Fibo 50 per cent of the rise from 100,000 to 108,600.
The decisions of both the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) will be at the forefront of the global market, he said, adding that expectations for the Fed are already clear, but that the likelihood of a balance sheet reduction program being activated could trigger a strengthening in the US dollar, although no interest rate hike is expected at the September FOMC.
This, he said, could trigger profit sales in the emerging country (GOL) stock market indices, which are overshadowed in the short term. "In addition, the key thing is what the ECB will say," he said.
After the July monetary policy board meeting, ECB President Mario Draghi said he would discuss the course of monetary policy in the fall, a rhetoric that allowed euro / dollar parity to rise above 1.1700 levels.
Therefore, statements about how to reduce or end the 60 billion-euro monthly asset purchase programme will mean that post-Fed liquidity on a global scale will also be reduced by the ECB.
"Therefore, negative pricing can be dealt with on the part of the country's markets, which have a high current account deficit such as Turkey and are obliged to access foreign funds," the report said.
Erol Gurcan, director of gear Investment Investment consultancy, also said there had been a fairly serious Rally in the United States in November 2016 in terms of global stock market markets following Trump's election as president.
Gurcan said it was possible to say that the main factor driving this Raleigh move was developments that would boost global growth expectations, particularly Trump's promises for a tax cut.
The stock exchange, Istanbul, also topped the global rally.
One of the main reasons is that the BIST 100 index has remained highly competitive in recent years compared to similar emerging world markets, but it is worth noting that the steps taken by policymakers to support the economy and financial markets have also played a significant role.
In particular, we can say that the Credit Garden Fund (KGF), which became active with its reputation in March, has had a significant impact on the rise in the index so far.
In the rest of the year, positive developments reflected significant pricing, and the KGF, which has a significant role to play in the rise, has slowly reached the doorstep, Gurcan said, adding that while the BIST 100 index still remains conducive to similar country markets, the search for a new story for the rest of the year could be slowly highlighted.
In particular, Gurcan said, developments such as the 180-day action plan, which has been expected to be shared for some time, the raising of the Credit Garden Fund's limit, and the introduction of regulations to support corporate profits, as well as the possible tax cut that has been raised recently, could contribute positively to this effect.
Gurcan stressed that the fact that key developed country central banks such as the Fed, ECB and the Bank of England (BoE) will also slowly tighten their current enlarged monetary policy stance is also among the critical risk factors for developing countries, adding: "The fact that the Fed, which has been going through measured interest rates for some time, is very likely to launch the balance sheet reduction process after September, the possibility that the ECB will soon end its asset buying programme, and the BOE's. The possibility that the Fed will then be one of the key developed country's central banks that will raise rates will be the main developments that need to be followed in this sense," he said.
According to Gurcan, the possible correction of the index in the coming period is critical for the 104,150-104,600 support areas, which have been on the rise since the beginning of the year and a 200-hour mobile average. If this support area is broken, the correction movement could continue to reach 101,700, 100,000 and 99,200, respectively.
If the current upward trend is maintained and the current historic peak level of 108,605 resistance is broken, the index could rise to 110,000-112,000, Gurcan said.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
In Kabul, the Afghan capital, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy, killing a NATO soldier and wounding a few, officials said.
Five soldiers and one interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
Local sources, who have not been confirmed, say three civilians were killed in the incident in the Karabakh region of the city.
The bombing is the latest act of violence in Afghanistan this month; more than 30 people died Tuesday in a mosque explosion in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed 2 people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday evening's blast involved an attack with a 'personnel-led improvised explosive device' on a joint patrol with the Afghan military.
All injuries are in good condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram air base, the statement said.
Reporters say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group, known as Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh, are a major concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
In the first half of 2017, Afghanistan witnessed the deaths of at least 1662 civilians, an average of 20% of them in the capital, according to the United Nations.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul's mostly Shiite region.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack themselves.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people in the deadliest militant attack in the country after US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The act of violence highlights the unstable security situation in Afghanistan as US president Donald Trump weighs in on whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country's military and police.
Reporters say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have led to a crisis in public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reprimands for delaying dirty air rule after lawsuits
The US Environmental Protection Agency returned a day later when 15 counties sued the organization over the initiative, following a decision to delay an Obama transfer law that demanded that counties block emissions that cause pill smoke.
The EPA announced its decision late Wednesday that it would continue with the "2015 Ozon Charges," saying it showed the organization's determination to work with the counties.
"We believe in dialogue with our provincial partners and to be sensitive to them," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's intention to delay ozone decisions by one year until October 2018; these decisions and current pill smoke pollution are measured across the country and decide where cuts are required to meet more challenging air quality standards.
Fifteen counties, mostly Democratic, and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is continuing its search to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations implemented by former president Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump has called to stimulate economic growth.
But those efforts have sparked a backlash from Democrats and protectionist groups who worry about the effects of more emissions on public health.
Air respiration containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as astonishment," the EPA's website says.
The forest has been heralded...
As well as stoppage and wing transfer!
Besiktas president Fikret Orman has spoken to Dutch football player Jeremain Lens and Bein Sports about the stoppage transfer.
Fikret Orman said:...
There is no surprise in the Transfer.
Our goal is not too much transfer, it's point-scoring.
Now we're going to have a stoppage and a wing transfer.
We have Champions League games, we'll have a good build-up in the build-up.
We have to transmit kangaroo from mecca.
The 10 m euros are very easy, but we don't have a budget like that.
If it comes to the budgets we say, we're going to transfer, and if we don't, we're not going to die.
It is not possible for me to provide information without clarity on Lens.
We are a public company.
The end of the saga is seductive.
Does the threat of ISID exist only for the festival, which exists for August 30th?
Reactions continue after the Ankara Governor's office banned all public events, including sit-ins, commemorations and other events during August, citing the "threat of Isil."
The governor's decision on the ban included "all mass events," while the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Ankara ruled that the ban was a "violation of international law."
The International Grand Ankara Festival is under way.
"It is out of the question that August 30th will be affected by the bans," Levent Gök, acting chairman of the CHP Group and Ankara MP, told the spokesman.
There is serious confusion.
Even the governor is hesitant about what decision he will implement...
The state's mission is to create areas where the holidays will be celebrated.
"All of Ankara has a security problem, only Gokcek's organizations do not have a security problem," CHP Ankara MP Murat Emir said.
Aylin Nazliaka, an independent MP from Ankara, took the ban to parliament.
"Does this ban clearly demonstrate the AKP's antagonism with the republic and Ataturk, and how do you think of blocking the millions who will celebrate August 30th in the fields?" He said, requesting the prime minister's answer.
"I personally learned from Edwina that I was being drunk," he said.
Demet Sener, whose divorce with Ibrahim Kutluay is under way, was in the Nationals with his lawyer, grace Hatemi, the previous day.
He filed a manslaughter lawsuit against Edwina Sponza, who he claimed destroyed her home, and presented photos of Sponza and Kutluay together as evidence to the court.
The autistic Sponza of Sociology also filed criminal charges against Sener, saying, "Demet took my private photos lawfully."
'YEMIN EDERIM, 'she captioned the image.
After that latest development, he met his lawyer at the Nationals Delicatessen, where he was out of the venue when he saw journalists.
Very cheerful, Sener glanced at Edwina Sponza's claim about the photos, saying, "Oh my God, I've got to go into her house and get it."
"There is such a complaint, but its content is not true," the astute Hatemi said of Sponza's complaint.
"We have everything; we have submitted it to the court," he said.
"At the time, everyone knew about your wife's relationship with Sponza," Sener told reporters.
"How did you know?" He said with great surprise.
What is it?
How?
"I didn't know if I would be sworn in," he said, adding, "Why would I believe in my husband looking into my eyes, or the gossip of my hands?"
"Don't you hear it?" He said, before reporters insisted. "I didn't hear it, but of course I heard it the first time."
But I didn't believe anything like that in any way.
Everything was normal, it was in place; there was nothing I could suspect.
Handicap, I had learned it all when he sent everything to the elite, the new meaning...
"Was Sponza the person who sent the evidence?" He asked. "Yes," he was confused by the photos and correspondence he had submitted to the court, claiming that Sponza had personally driven him.
Sponza had previously claimed that his correspondence with Ibrahim Kutluay was a monster.
Besiktas will sign a contract with Negredo tomorrow
The Besiktas Club will officially include Spanish football player Alvaro Negredo in its squad tomorrow.
A signing ceremony will be held at Vodafone Park for Negredo, where Besiktas has agreed in principle on a transfer with Spain's Valencia Club.
The signing ceremony, which will be attended by club president Fikret Orman, will take place at 12pm.
Meanwhile, the Spanish footballer will undergo a medical tomorrow morning.
Qatar: We broke the embargo thanks to Turkey within hours
Qatar's Economy and Trade Minister Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani said he wanted to express his gratitude to the people of Turkey.
Al Thani: "I am very thankful for your honoured position and the support you have given us."
I also conveyed to my brother, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the greetings of the Qatar emirate.
Qatar's economy has defied its resistance.
In many countries, economies are negatively affected, while our economy remains robust.
We have to work with our power to ensure Qatar's independence and strong.
We have largely broken the embargo against us thanks to Turkey within hours.
At the moment, we don't have a lack of any issues at all.
Our natural resources, gas exports, are a major boost to Qatar's economy.
Turkey has not been affected by the brutal crackdown against us and the blockade of the laws.
Today, Qatar is again continuing its worldwide production in gas and LNG.
"In the wake of what happened, we had a 30 per cent increase, not a drop in gas exports," he said.
Work is under way in all areas with brotherly relations between Qatar and Turkey, Al Thani said, adding, "There was a volume of $554 million in the first quarter in the volume of trade in our territory."
Recent decisions have played an important role.
It is very important for us to increase the flow of goods from Turkey in all sectors, as well as investments in many fields, as a result of the fact that Turkish products are self-identified in the Qatar market.
"I thank you very much for your constructive attitude towards us," he said.
The cost of the latest disasters is £300 m
TSB President Can Akın Caglayan said that in the aftermath of the July 18th flood raid, insurance companies received 7,000 damage notifications of 116 million TL. On July 21st, there were 800 reports of damage worth 12 million euros, and on July 27th, there were 22,000 damage notices of 168 million litres in the floods and dwellings in Istanbul, bringing the total cost of the last three incidents to 300 million euros.
"In terms of car insurance, the damage caused by the filling is 3,500 euros per vehicle, while the glass damage is around 1,000 euros," he said.
"In the quake, the average house damage is 6,000 euros," he said.
He said the industry is working hard to compensate for the economic losses. "Out of 4 people, 3 out of 4 have no housing insurance, one out of every 2 businesses does not have fire insurance, and 2 out of 3 do not have insurance," he said. "The risk of natural disasters is increasing due to climate change."
Due to the low level of insurance in our country, the risk of our citizens and institutions facing serious costs of damage is growing daily.
All of these costs should not be left on the state.
Insurance pollinators aren't as expensive as they thought, but insurance isn't just an industry that pays damages; it's also a risk management consultant.
Raising the rate of insurance awareness and insurance is very important for our people and our country.
"In the general terms of insurance insurance, signifiers must report their damage within 5 business days, a period that ended yesterday," he said.
"Will there be an insured victim?" He asked. "If there is such a period of time in general circumstances, the statute of limitations in the Trade Code is 2 years."
"Also, this is a natural disaster, so there is no need for signifiers to panic, no company can pay," he said.
The German media saw the huge tender like this!
Amid growing difficulties between Turkey and Germany, the German company Siemens won Turkey's first Wind Energy Renewable Energy Settlement Area (YEKA) tender.
"Germany's Siemens won the huge tender in Turkey," German media quoted the development as saying.
"The consortium will invest more than $1 billion in wind power plants," DWelle reported, quoting the Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon consortium that won the YEKA tender.
"The tender for the construction of 1,000 megawatts of wind power capacity is Turkey's first YEKA tender," the report said, adding that the number of companies competing in the tender has now dropped from 8 to 2, China's Mingyang and Germany's Siemens are facing each other, and the Chinese consortium Mingyang has withdrawn from the tender as the 30th round begins.
After the tender, Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak made sensational remarks about Turkish-German relations.
The tender was cheered by the win of the German company Siemens, and we can say that this picture is an important message to the region and the world.
In terms of the 200 years of historical co-operation between Turkey and Germany, I think that this outcome will contribute significantly to Turkish-German relations.
I am very proud of the fact that, regardless of the regional crises in the world, Turkey is one of the most reliable investment countries in the region and the world.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible competition
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who will be cutting paths to showcase their most satisfying boxing match in the near future for the 147-pound six, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, was in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until he walked the corridor and greeted Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-derivative coin champion.
By voting on Showtime on Monday, he beat Adrien Broner, the former world champion in four heavyweights, after Garcia beat him, with both unbeaten finalists among the top five on the list who are not under the supervision of the coin.
Garcia extended his right hand and said: "How does he go, champion?
Good luck to you. "
Lomachenko will defend his belt on ESPN at 7 a.m. on Saturday night against Miguel Marriaga.
As the two posed for photos, Lomochenko's manager, Egis Klimar, noted that a potential ambush between the beat would be "the perfect size."
"I'm an old derivative coin," Garcia recalled.
"I went up for the Broner (140 poles), but I'm not that big," he said.
I'm downstairs for 140.
I want to get down to the light coin.
He should pass on the light coin (135 pounds), then we can beat it.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that. "
Lomachenko attended.
"Boksun needs this beating," he said.
Klimas asked if it should be in 'pay and interest'; arranging a date for a dazzling summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 naked) and beating Lomachenko in an opening match of 135 pounds later this year is part of his strategy; Garcia is also interested in beating the winner of the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell match for the lightweight title at the Forum on September 23.
"The beat could be in 'pay and interest' because all the fans want it," Garcia said, adding that he was open to it if the channel offered the best financial package.
We are the main names.
No other name would have that degree of interest.
When are they ready? "
Garcia said she appreciated Lomachenko as a "tremendous beat" and could attend Saturday's match.
But Lomachenko was hesitant to show plenty of cutting-edge praise for Garcia and said he thought the three-coin champion from Riverside seemed "very slow," adding: "I don't care, Mikey... naked you want it."
Garcia said the obituary was boxing after showing off his punching power first.
Both said they felt momentum had been created for their own encounter.
"It's a beating that needs to be done.
No other beating would create so much attention and rhetoric.
"I'm so happy to deal with that," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I was waiting for the best beat and that's Mikey.
It's going to be a great beat. "
From Russia to America, Turkish restaurant
The White House is not considering imposing sanctions that would affect Moscow's pipeline construction, but sanctions against Russia could increase the cost of those lines.
The reason is the increased cost of borrowing.
Concerned that Western investment partners might consider withdrawing from the projects due to sanctions, the Kremlin in turn stepped up construction of the pipelines.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which is building the Turkish Stream pipeline, which is scheduled to reach Turkey under the Black Sea, has given a boost to construction at the request of Gazprom.
Reuters reported that Gazprom has also begun construction of a second pipeline in line with Turkish Stream "hastily" in order to export more gas to Europe.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment test released
The latest results of assessment tests of refugees subject to a new medical age assessment method in Sweden have ruled that more than 80 per cent of those who participated in the test are more than 18 years old, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these tests.
Sweden's national Forensic Medicine and Improvement Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) began doing the tests earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make the age assessment more accurate in the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for their failure to assess the right age of some refugees who claimed they were not minors.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the test, and the Department of Forensic Medicine and Improvement has now announced the results of a total of 2481 of the tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
More than 80 per cent (in 2002) were deemed to be 18 or above, and in 25 cases, the Department of Forensic Medicine and Improvement ruled that the experiment was "probably 18 and above."
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was "probably under 18."
The tests were conducted only in cases where the person's age was suspicious.
According to Johan Goransson of the Department of Criminal Medicine and Improvement, the results are consistent with past months.
"We don't see a big difference in statistics compared to past months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases deemed to be more than 18 years old does not necessarily mean that refugees lie about their age.
In the majors, the agency announced the outcome of the 581 facility and said there were 442 cases where "the people surveyed were shown to be 18 years old or larger."
When the daily Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of 581 reported cases, it found that 243 cases had publicly declared that they had turned 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method, which involves pulling the rays of 20-year-olds and doing MRI screening of knees, then analysing them to feminists and radiologists, has been criticised in some quarters.
One of the findings is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, who assesses the biological maturity of people who are also working on whether the age of bullying is sooner or later than normal.
"I have reasons to think about it and I think it shouldn't be the kind of measurement used.
It's very doubtful to decide the biological age that way.
If we can't say for sure, then we shouldn't do it as it is, "he told the Metro daily.
But Goransson, of the Department of Forensic Medicine and Improvement, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you might say the risk of a child being wrongly judged to be an adult is small.
The biggest risk is that the person is just under 18 years old, and in this case the risk is around 10 per cent. "
Yildiz Hamidija Mosque opens for worship today
The Yildiz Hamidija Mosque, commissioned by Abdulhamit in 1885 by architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, will be opened for prayer today after restoration.
The restoration, which began in June 2013, has been completed and the mosque has been ready for the opening, Regional Director Mürsel Sari said.
"Restoration work was conducted in 2 scope," he said.
The first part was repairing the mosque, the main building.
The second part was environmental regulation.
About 16 m euros have been spent on the First Amendment and around 11 m euros on environmental regulation.
First, the building of the wooden dome was opened, and after they were renovated, the external walls, the tentacles of external factors, were removed from the pastures.
There have been drenches on health care.
There are very rich decorations, as seen when we come inside the mosque.
It's a monument that has Star motifs, and it's also very rich in heart work.
There's a mixed base here.
"The traces of Scots are also being seen, and it is in architecture that started to be a factor in the baroque, considering that they were made in the Ottoman and 1880s," he said.
Image copyright EPA Image caption There are EMEDs
"The hunted German Emperor II, located at the central site of the mosque," he said.
He had partial arthritis, was defeated and cleared, and was asleep instead.
It's a really precious and important piece.
There are wooden cafés on both sides of the mosque that we call greetings, which are asymmetrical.
We know that these were done personally by Abdulhamit Han, our chief judge who commissioned the mosque.
So we have information that he did them personally with his own hands and that they were assembled here.
They are still standing here in their original form.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to attend the opening ceremony of the mosque, he said.
Watch: Pantic claims to have been killed
Ukrainian media reported that the 25-year-old Serbian footballer, who failed to make it into the squad in Dinoma Kiev, could be leased to the yellow-card club.
Pantic, who started football for his country, Serbia's Red Star, played for Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves in Spain.
Pantic signed for Dinamo Kiev in the knockout stages of last season
West Virginia governor says he will change his party
Jim Justice, the Democratic governor of West Virginia, said Thursday evening he would change his party at a rally with President Trump.
"Whether you go to your office or not, the Democrats have left me," Vali Justice said.
"I'm going to tell you today with a lot of prayers and thoughts... I'm going to tell you today as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore as a Democratic governor," he said.
The rally burst into cheers.
"So, I'm going to change my record tomorrow as a Republican," Justice added.
"If I was a coach, it was time to give you a different game, I would say," he said.
Mr Trump had earlier vowed to make a significant announcement at a West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice, the Democratic nominee, did not support Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the province, was elected in 2016, according to Forbes.
Forbes notes that with the coal business he inherited from his father, he owns coal mines in 5 counties.
Its assets are about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Convention released a statement on Thursday evening saying that "Vali Justice's party change is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is needing to work to block it rather than make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors in history and the control of at least several county legislative chambers, Vali Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that has been without a leader from scratch and has failed to find a positive, unifying message," RNC women's spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS.
I will do my best for Turkey
The Olympic third is Turkey's receptionist.
He was born in Cuba, but he Belted Turkey his own homeland when he arrived for the F.B....
He became a Turkish citizen in 2013 and was a national striker....
He became European champion first and then Olympic third...
Now he is one of Turkey's top medal prospects at the World Athletics Championships.
Yasmani Capello, competing in the 400 m hurdles, spoke to the morning before the championship, which begins today.
When you were young, they didn't want you because you didn't like their degrees in Cuba.
Develop coaching tutorials.
Then they called it, and this time you don't go.
Some think the skin has chosen Turkey for the sake of money.
What do you say?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was my departure from the national team.
From that moment on, I can say that I have drawn a line to the events I have experienced, to what I have experienced.
And then I came to Turkey at the invitation of the Fenerbahce club.
The initiative for the National Team was also thanks to Fenerbahce.
They offered me an offer for reinforcement.
Along with Turkey, I have opened a new chapter.
I've had a lot of injuries in my youth, but I've had significant successes in Rio and Amsterdam after the empathy offered to me in Turkey.
I'm looking forward to doing my best at the World Athletics Championships and winning a different title.
Take a break from the recent press conference.
Do you understand the reason to us?
Whenever a question is raised about Turkey having me; I have a childhood in mind, and at the age of 23, I am kicked out of Cuba's National Team.
And, of course, people in Turkey have an approach to me.
When I won a gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam, I felt the same when I was playing the Rescue.
I couldn't hold my eyes.
I am also very grateful to Turkey for giving me the opportunity to realise my dreams.
I am very happy that I belong to the Turkish National Team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You've said before that there might be Turkish lovers.
At the moment, if you are with a Turkish, you go to Cuba together.
Do you want to share what they've experienced?
The biggest afterthought of being with a Turk is calamity...
Peace when I compare it to Cuban women...
Turkish girls have relationships.
The girlfriend is also an assistant coach.
Is your unit all day, for instance, involved in your nutrition?
He's eating more sweets than me.
(Both of them laugh) I don't actually have a very tight diet, but occasionally it gets involved in what I eat.
My coach, Massimo Matrone, also often has harsh warnings about my diet, but I know, these are for my good.
How does he cook with Turkish food, and how does he eat the skin of his loved ones?
Turkish women make a lot of good food, but my love makes it more beautiful.
(Laughing) Kuru bean-pillow is the first choice.
It's just GMT to him.
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He's got other young people in my place.
After winning medals on behalf of Turkey, we met in Cuba.
Looking at my face, he showed me to the young athletes next to me and said, "He's here, I raised him."
I just laughed at him.

It's a wonder of the eye I wear in the races...
I just use it for concentration.
As soon as I wear the eye, I cut my relationship with the world and put a wall on my two sides.
I'm just focusing on the finish line and I don't see anything else.
Tokyo IN HEYECANLI Tokyo 2020: What first comes to mind when we say it?
Felix Sanchez...
She won gold at the 2012 London Olympics when she was 35 years old in the 400 m hurdles.
If he can, I can do it in Tokyo at the age of 33, why not.
Turkcell support VERIYOR
Turkcell Deputy Director Ismail All said he believes Yasmani Capello will succeed in London. "We firmly believe that Yasmani will represent our flag in the best way at this championship," he said.
We wish all the athletes who will compete in London success.
"We will continue our support for the further development of Turkish athletics and for greater success in our country," he said.
CoE praises Russia's' sincere 'apology for doping scandal
Sebastian CoE, the boss of global athletics, praised Russia's apology, which he described as sincere, referring to the doping scandal, but insisted the time was not right for the country to be re-admitted to the sport.
Russia's athletic boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country was right to be banned from the sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he apologised to "all the athletes whose gold and silver medals were forcibly taken from them in the competitions."
Despite his assessment, the IAAF Congress voted to continue the ban after a World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) report in November 2015 found evidence of state-sponsored darkness in Russia.
"I think today is a very sincere response, a very sincere presentation," the IAAF president told CoE reporters.
"The entire council and the entire congress were pleased... that the Russian Federation accepted him, that he had survived the very turbulent days and that he did everything possible to ensure the federation's reconstruction," he said.
The CoE said it was also "satisfied" with Russia's acceptance of the criteria for re-admission.
"I think it's a very constructive day and I think the way has been taken, but Congress supports the suggestion that the task force is not the right time for Russia's rights to be returned," CoE said.
"We have to do everything to normalise this situation over the next few months.
Our roadblock principle has always been to ask clean athletes to separate themselves from the flawed system, "he added.
Onnine Russian athletes, who meet strict IAAF criteria, will be competing in neutral at the World Athletics Championships in London, which begin on Friday.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had not yet met several criteria for the return of its rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters the drug test was still inadequate and banned coaches were still working freely.
US to deny 'YPG to tank' reports
The US Embassy in Ankara says no tanks have been given to any side fighting in Syria.
Allegations that hundreds of trucks full of tanks and weapons were sent to the YPG have been denied.
The embassy said in a statement, "The explanation for the false media reports about the trucks going to Syria."
In a series of untrue reports in the press over the past few days, illustrated, the United States has allegedly sent hundreds of trucks full of tanks and weapons to Syrians to support the YPG.
These reports ignore some basic facts about the current situation in Syria.
The United States has not provided tanks to any group fighting against Deasha in Syria.
A large portion of the EUPM's military assistance -- primarily light weapons and ammunition -- supports elements of the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
Syrian Arabs, including the SUV, are fighting to clear the Dead from the area and regain their homes.
TYDTA President Ermut: Foreign direct investment would be higher than last year
TYDTA President Arda Ermut said 55 per cent of all investment last year came after July.
"Maybe there would have been more increases, it hit the basket," Ermut said, citing the lack of a reduction in investment due to the 15 July coup attempt.
Maybe if these conditions were not created, without some regional developments, we could see a further increase in the impact of the collision.
We are more hopeful for next year because of him.
It will be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
Already, as of the first 5 months, we are going up 11 per cent compared to the first 5 months of last year.
But we don't find that enough.
"We hope there will be more," he added.
"It doesn't worry us, whether it's global or regional developments," he said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Normally, he said, 75 per cent of foreign direct investments come from Europe by 2010.
That number has fallen to 66 per cent.
Still, Asia's share rose from 2 percent to 7-8 percent.
Russia's share has increased.
When we tried to do that, the Gulf states had some problems of their own.
Turkey has good relations with all of them; Saudi Arabia and Qatar, in particular, are two key actors.
But we are saddened by the problem between these two countries and, as it stands, allows investors to postpone their decisions for a little longer.
We may be experiencing some delays, not only in terms of investments in Turkey, but also because of that.
Ermut noted that there were some incidents in Germany last week, but that the government, in particular President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has shown clear and precise relevance to the situation.
When they spoke to investors in the countries where the toughest political crisis has occurred, President Erdogan's remark said, "The problems are between governments, certainly not among the people."
Second, these people have come and invested in our country.
They have no difference for us from Turkish companies.
On the contrary, they will come to us when they have the slightest problems, and we will solve it.
"We will certainly not allow them to be victims," he said, adding that they continue to support all investors with the comfort of it.
"In the coming period, we can give the confidence of that," he said.
What you will see is that neither German companies, nor investors from countries where we have had some problems politically in any way, will have any trouble.
On the contrary, we will do our best to increase investments from these countries.
We think that the investments that come from here will continue to increase.
Of course, policy developments can sometimes affect perceptions of the investment climate.
"But we will do our part at this point and do our best with the aim that our investors will not be affected by the perception of an investment environment as well," he said.
TYDTA President Ermut explained that after a one-generation one-way strategy, Turkey is starting to attract a lot of interest from China, but if the problems in the Gulf are resolved, they expect the biggest investment from the Gulf.
"In relations with Germany, we have had difficulties because of these relations, we had investments because of this phenomenon, we are running away," he said, adding that there are not even one investor. "There are companies that come, come and follow."
"Currently, up to 10 per cent of the projects in our portfolio are by German companies," he said.
That is, almost 10 per cent of the companies we are talking to from around the world are German companies.
Some of them are companies that already have investments in Turkey.
He's going to grow the man's investment, or he has a subject, and that's what we're open to as a project.
"So German companies are actually still a significant part of our daily business flow," he said.
Stressing that all state institutions should be careful at the time of perception operations in Turkey, Ermut said the issue was sensitive and could be affected by the slightest form of bad communication.
Ermut said what happened in the last 2-3 weeks was a good lesson.
The agenda of investors and politicians is always different.
We have always seen it; economic relations always allow political developments to sort of move on.
Germany will remain an important trade partner and an important investor.
Because it already has a lot of investments in Turkey.
The election agenda in Germany, unfortunately, increases such rhetoric.
And when they go through, I think they're going to get a little bit more on track.
In Saudi Arabia's feature, the two countries are careful not to make negative statements.
In the end, an investor investing in Turkey is investing in all of the surrounding country's markets.
So there have been processes that have slowed down a bit, not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region.
But we are still in discussions with these investors.
My personal view is that investors are now waiting for a decision that maybe they can get faster.
'In a negative sense, I see uncertainty because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, I'm out of here, 'he said, adding:' We don't have Saudi investors.
On the contrary, we still have Saudi investors who continue to live in Turkey, who are holidaying here while also talking to us and following all their processes.
"I think we will definitely pass it this year," he said, recalling the $12.3 billion in international direct investments (UDY) that came to Turkey last year.
"But it will affect how far we go, these regional developments, global uncertainties," he said.
"If there is no bad development, I believe that we will definitely close the end of this year or so, more than last year," he said, pointing out that the normally skewed effect could be more limited, with an increase of 11 per cent as of the first 5 months.
Noting that a significant portion of the investments will continue to be real estate, Ermut said new investments could be seen in logistics, health, fintech, IT, petro-chemistry, food, energy and manufacturing.
He also stressed that there will be new investments to be announced in the coming months. "There may be an investment anomaly in terms of manufacturing in the near future," he said.
It's not a billion dollars, but it's a big investment.
"There could also be investments from entertaining countries," he said.
Crackdown on 4 wine companies in 9 provinces: 55 arrests
Teams of the Istanbul Directorate for Combating Trafficking Crime found that the foliage covering the mushroom taps sold by 4 wine companies was kept long and loose, the bandwidth was not made into a bottle, the TAPDK bandwidth on the cover was picked up after the products were sold, and the newly produced wines were sold and marketed.
They say the state has lost 20,000 to 400,000 euros in taxes due to the re-use of the suspects' bandwidth.
Police carried out a co-ordinated operation today at 55 addresses of 4 wine companies, including factories and warehouses in Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirdag, Bursa, Balikesir, Manisa, Aydin, Denizli and Nevada.
A total of 55 people were detained during the operation, including 15,000 ready-to-sell wines, 52,480 bottles of used TAPDK bandwidth-filled wine bottles, 12,890 TAPDK bandwidth capsules, 3 pistols and bullets, 100 boxes of sexually explicit hair, 992 illegal purses, 698 bottles of various types of counterfeit drinks and 100 litres of anaesthetic cannabis.
The 55 people detained were brought to the Directorate for Combating Trafficking Crime, located on Vatan Street.
The suspects remain in custody.
Their operation at the factory, warehouses and businesses was captured on police cameras.
During their search of a store, police officers appeared to check in by releasing the capsules on wine bottles ready for sale.
Police officers were recorded examining bags packed with used bottles of TAPDK bandwidth.
How will football's financial rules affect Neymar's departure to Paris?
Rules to prevent unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent Neymar's world-record transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any result could come from UEFA's Paris Saint-Germain, the governing body that oversees the European game, which has the power to mentor teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
The Final Fair Player of the Year rules, issued by UEFA in 2011, mean that in front of PSG they will eventually have to show that Neymar financed his transfer without huge losses.
Barcelona have been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will rule out a salary that would amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some financial aspects of Neymar's departure for France include:
Given the team's money from the energy-rich Qatari family, PSG could of course pay the money to sign Neymar and add him to the premiership of other stars.
Clubs are allowed to spend hefty money to recruit players, but they also have to balance it with legitimate sources of income, provided they are able to cope with their football-related affairs.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
The former Frenchman believed clubs that suffered huge debts after success were effectively fraudulent and were at risk of bankruptcy if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the FFP began monitoring its losses rather than focusing on clubs' debts.
The change meant that the model first used by Roman Abramovic at Chelsea in 2003 (a club al with potential, high spending slots to improve the team and a global brand creation) turned into a more difficult attempt.
During the 3-year FFP assessment period, which runs through 2018, clubs can suffer losses of 30 m euros.
Although Platini was unreputably removed from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Aleksander Ceferin, is still committed to giving up on overspending.
Andrea Traverso, who manages the FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week: "The FFP certainly hasn't died and we will certainly strengthen the rules by moving forward."
Although PSG will collectively pay for Neymar's purchase clause, for accounting reasons it could spread the captaincy to the duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a 5-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown at a cost of 44.4 m euros in annual accounts for the next 5 years.
The first wave of FFP patrons in 2014 saw the introduction of the heaviest patrons to Manchester City, which is owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
PSG were fined 60 million euros ($82 million for that time), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and were ordered to limit their Champions League squad for the 2014-2015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is teaming up against clubs that could try to alter financial regulators by infusing their revenue through companies linked to the club's owners.
Although a Qatari company can sponsor PSG, if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market values, UEFA will not allow it to be counted as a rightful income.
That was the case in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the Qatar Tourism Authority's PSG sponsorship was inflated.
Part of Neymar's gain from PSG could reportedly come through payments from Qatar's 2022 World Cup organising committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied Neymar will be a World Cup ambassador, and such a move could easily be revealed by UEFA regulators.
The sanctions imposed on PSG in the past mean UEFA will be even more careful against attempts to circumvent the rules.
UEFA is not in a pre-emptive discussion with PSG about Neymar's transfer, according to those familiar with the matter on Tuesday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk about PSG's situation.
The latest published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 m euros in 2015-16, with a turnover of 542.4 m euros.
Accounts for last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expect Neymar's arrival to contribute to sponsorship deals, souvenirs and strip sales.
The club expects turnover to increase by at least 30 per cent after signing.
Clearly irritated by the departure of one of football's biggest players, the Spanish league has sought to block Neymar's departure for allegedly violating PSG's FFP.
"This is an open case of 'financial doping' with his club and state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar being the exact owner of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose own club is owned by an American sports giant, shares his concerns about La Liga being funded by a state.
"This is a result of having, and it has completely changed the whole zeal of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"When a country has a club once, everything is possible.
It would be very difficult to respect financial Fair Play because for a country such a great player to represent a country can lead to different methods or different areas of interest.
Signs to name 'chicken price'
According to TSB data, the insurance sector has suffered a loss in traffic branding since 2006.
The sector lost 2.35 billion TL in 2015, compared with just 19 million TL profits in 2016.
The stock exchange is being traded in Istanbul by Akinsurance, Anadolu Insurance and Sun Insurance.
At the meeting, which assessed the TSB's first six-month results for 2017, he said 11-year losses in traffic insurance had reached 7.3 billion TL, while with the introduction of ceiling pricing, he estimated the industry's losses would rise to 2.3 billion TL this year and the estimated damage-pricing rate to 125 per cent.
This year, the 2015 figure will be captured, he said, noting that the damage written in 2012 and 2015 also took the profits of other branding: "This means that by funding the bad driver, we are also increasing the price of the citizen's housing policy."
"75 per cent of the industry is foreign, and our partners abroad have financed bad driving in a sense," he said.
He added: "I don't think it's going to happen.
We do not expect a profit from the Trademark, but when we look at the past 11 years, we cannot show that we have made a profit in any year.
"We agree with that, but we remain hopeful that we can carry that damage in a reasonable environment, along with other pollinators," he said.
He said there were dramatic price increases when the damage to the trailer took the profitability of other products, adding: "There were around 30 per cent price increases in traffic insurance in 2012, it almost doubled in 2015, we wrote the biggest loss in our history."
"Even in an environment where prices have increased so much, at the end of 2016 our trademark profits were just 19 million TL," he said.
He said he expected a free tariff to be introduced next year, adding: "We will lower the price of good driving on the free tariff and impose a high price on bad driving."
"However, the Treasury is looking at the overall trajectory, the last word on when it will happen is in the Treasury," he said.
The Treasury Department has introduced a maximum premium (ceiling price) from April 12, saying the rise in mandatory traffic insurance premiums from 2015 has affected a broad segment of society.
Under it, the maximum premiums for mandatory traffic insurance will be set on the basis of designated city groups, taking into account each group of vehicles, baseline and traffic congestion, and accident statistics.
On the other hand, as of July, the so-called "Pool of risky Signs" has been implemented for the high frequency of damage to the mandatory traffic insurance, or for vehicle groups.
Premiums and damage to traffic insurance policy under the pool will be divided among insurance companies.
The pricing of these signifiers will be identified by the Treasury Department.
He said that with the introduction of ceiling pricing, the trail saw premium production fall 11.5 per cent in the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period a year ago, while the number of pollinators increased by 4.9 per cent to 8.6 million, while the reduction in traffic pollinators, given inflation, reached about 30 per cent.
This year, he said, traffic will again lead to snow in other directions. "With these ceiling prices, this damage cannot be sustained.
How much can the industry bear this damage? "He said.
The capital of all companies in the sector is 9 billion TL, and when only 2.3 billion TL trades are damaged, the industry's capital will be finished in three years, he said. "Foreigners are looking at 'Why is the good driver financing the bad driver, why are my thousands of shareholders financing the bad driver in Turkey?'" He said.
"At this point, we're trying to explain our lesson to the Treasury," he said.
Asked if foreigners had come to the point of reducing weight in the Turkish insurance sector following these developments, Caglayan said, "We haven't come to that point yet."
They expect to invest more in Turkey because the Netherlands has an average of 6 pollinators per capita, while in Turkey it is 1.3.
"So Turkey is a place that needs to be truly enchanted," he said.
So they haven't given up on it.
However, the company earns reasonable profitability each year, leaving all profits in the stands and using it for the company's growth.
In 2016, pricing output in the sector was 40.5 billion TL, compared to 23.1 billion TL in the first half of this year, up 12 per cent on the same period last year, according to TSB data.
He said he estimated the industry would not end the year with 15 per cent growth in total premium production.
Thousands of chronic patients hail benefits
The details and implementation of the "New Social Assistance Programme for families battling chronic diseases," which began work recently under the orders of Family and Social Policies Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, have become clear.
The social assistance programme for impoverished citizens and their families will benefit 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients in the first phase.
Patients will receive monthly support of more than two-thirds of the minimum wage, as well as regular psychosocial support.
The ministry will also make additional payments to tuberculosis patients who have been identified by the health unit for their failure to address their medical self-care, their lives as dependent on bed, or the need to improve home living conditions.
The payments will be made via Social Assistance cards, which will be provided through the PTT.
Those who are unable to withdraw money for reasons such as geographical conditions, illness, disability will be paid at the door.
In many ways, the programme is the first in the world.
One in 10 companies to invest is still German
Arda Ermut, head of the Turkish Investment Support and Promotion Agency at the prime minister's office, said that German companies in Turkey are seen as Turkish companies, and that the political tension between the two countries is not reflected in the business world.
"There is not one investor in relations with Germany who says, 'We are running away because of this situation,'" Ermut added.
"About 10 per cent of the projects now are by German companies," he said.
Some have investments in Turkey.
"Germans make up an important part of our daily flow of jobs," he said.
The fact that Abraaj Group is a partner in the logistics company Netlog is a good example, he said.
"We have invested a total of $1 billion in Turkey," said Omar Syed, chairman of the Abraaj Group, citing Turkey's economic growth.
Ozer on his way to becoming the Last Ottoman
The veteran player, who has been given two weeks to find a club, has reportedly signed an agreement with the Ottomans and will sign an official contract in the coming days.
At the start of last season, Ozer Hurst, who signed a contract with the go-ahead club until 2019, 4 hours before the end of the transfer, played in 29 league, 2 cup games and contributed significantly to the team with a 5-goal 4-point performance.
Having closed his way back to Ozer, management agreed with Brazilian Sergio Antonio yesterday to replace that player.
The transcript of the century took place!
Barcelona have said Neymar is moving to Paris Saint-Germain for a price of £22 million.
The recent transfer development, which has been followed by excitement from the football public, has taken a toll.
PSG paid the Catalan team £222 m, the price of the player's release, for the Brazilian player, adding the star name to their squad.
Neymar has been the most expensive transfer in the history of football, along with this bonus.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), one of the France 1st Football League (Ligue 1) teams, has announced it has signed a 5-year contract with Brazilian star Neymar.
Neymar, 25, who became the world's most expensive footballer by being given 222 m euros for his bonus festive beard, has signed a contract that will be available at PSG until June 30, 2022, the club's website said.
Speaking after the signing, Neymar said he was very happy that he would be stripped of his France representative, adding: "Since I started my football life in Europe, PSG have always been one of the most combative and ambitious teams."
My reason to come to this club and join my team-mates is to get a lot of cups, as our fans wish, "he added.
PSG will pay Neymar €45 m for each season.
Thus, the cost of the star will cost the French representative more than 400 m euros.
Marine workers' strike ends with price hike
An agreement on an increase in the collective contract between the Izmir Metropolitan Municipality company IZDENIZ AS and the Turkish-Business Union of Turkish sailors (TDS) was not reached.
Union member IZDENIZ workers then went on strike on July 12th.
The strike, which lasted close to a month, came to an end as of 15.00 today, following an increase in workers.
Under the signed collective labour contract, the salaries of land staff within the IZDENIZ will be increased by 12 per cent.
IZDENIZ, which renewed its fleet, received an Revenue Tax exemption after it enrolled in the International Wildlife registry, while its salaries increased by 25 per cent -- a 5 per cent increase for staff on the ship's status.
The IZDENIZ General Directorate announced that domestic blind flights will continue with normal tariffs, flights to Yassycaada will start from Tuesday, and flights to Foça and Urla will start by the end of next week.
TDS President Hasan Pekdemir said they had blocked access with their 23-day strike. "The people of Izmir will be relieved," he said.
As a result of the strike, improvements have been made to the rights of our workers working in the snow and at sea.
Happily, we leave the table.
There will be an average of 28 per cent of the pocket working in the sea and 20 per cent in the black.
We also had friends working at the minimum wage level.
We have also made significant improvements in their salaries.
Nostalgia Opens Nis With "American Woman Without Issue" and "Journey Detectives"
It is, for the brilliant days of the characters in the 80s, for the grunge period of the 90s (when beauties like David Wain and Michael Showalter did the skewed comedy "The State" for MTV), and for him, for 2001, before his stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd continued with bigger things, this version of the story was nostalgic for all.
As a cultural product, this is both the tipping and clicking of our permanent memorable Facebook era.
But as a sergeant, it's as if his time is running out.
"The First Day of the camp" was unexpectedly successful, and that wasn't just thanks to its abstract humor (in it, there was a story about the origins of a speaking box bitch performed by H. Jon Benjamin.)
By concentrating on the main comic (in which middle-aged actors play aboriginal children who are minors), he made it impossible to re-capture the past part of the show.
Now, the "Decade of the Year," in which adults play adults, is less emotional, and the parochial, including the monologue about the divisive takeaway film "El, which shook the Fifth" of the 90s, is more apparent.
At one point, he's the character; he mixes an Apple Powerbook, some one-on-one-wheel patterns and "a lot of other things from 1991."
Many of the main stories are the same.
Soft-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter) is now a writer, he still hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his gut.
There is also another crazy haunting plot involving Ronald Reagan (again Mr. Showalter), who is now befriended by George H. W. Bush (a very well-sat takeaway by Michael Ian Black).
As usual, the best part of the series is the occasional lyrics.
It's especially welcome to see the always young Mr. Rudd, who has a dubious six-year-old injury in Matt Dillon's "guts," and his, Andy, the former school's most popular child, now looks like a moron.
There may be moments of unbridled delight that give power to this series (for instance, a sort of re-enactment of "Seven Up!"), until it reaches what I think is the logical conclusion: "The American Woman of Isis: Twenty Years After," in the final scene, friends will be allowed to go to see the premiere of the movie "The American Woman of the Dead."
Meanwhile, Amazon's "Journey Detectives" addresses a different kind of nostalgia: The Cold War resurgence of "The Americans," the film "The Bomber of the Saracens," and even "GLOW," with its iconography against Eastern, Western wrestling.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, directed by Rhys Thomas, seems to have found TV: A 1980s Romanian police friends drama in which two Bucharest police officers fought for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist path.
The roles are played by wolf Gregor and idealist Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue is made by the English dusty Channing Tatum (who is also the lead producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a very brilliant idea.
But that's not much more than an idea.
There are some pleasant visual comics (as Americans watch football, policemen spend time watching chess on TV)
The well-known sound artist cast also includes Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny; "who's the voice" is a good material for the play.
But the "Journey grandfather" is so dedicated to the resemblance of a hiding propaganda drama to reality (including a murderer wearing a Reagan mask) that he often plays exactly like him.
Six long episodes don't know to pass, and comedy isn't quick or frequent enough.
While Gregor and Iosef continuously visited the US embassy, where there are two bloodied men in the lobby who always eat a bowl of hamburgers like hungry wolves, "The Road Detective" could have better fulfilled the propaganda satire if it had been shortened to a narrower length.
The message to the fictitious communist viewer is that Western culture can turn anything into something that will be swift.
The Romanian creators of Kurmaca were not unfair: We are doing it to our own recent past and even to them.

The British Government has seen the death and sacrifice of our family as a result of fifty years of experience.
The government's shrine authorities have acknowledged that this family has been inextricably committed to the British Government ever since, and that it has provided great services.
It is lurid for the British Government to be smart and careful about this Field, which it has planted in its own hands, to study and examine everything well and to decide carefully.
As we try to understand FEMA, the organisation of the Houses as a starting point is addressed, but a forgotten eloquent difference is that FEMA is an organization that emerges in the emperor era and acts with exploitative saints.
The 'leading movement' that needs to be dealt with in this mindset is the Women's March on the canal.
In the British praise of the initiative, the man who describes himself as' the Fig that the British Government has planted with its hands' is Mirza Gulâm Ahmet Kadiyânî, founder of the Women's Party.
"On December 1, 1888, he reported that God had ordered him to take a bite from his supporters and create a separate community," said Kadyrov-born Gulâm Ahmed, a small town in the Indian state of Pencap.
Gulâm Ahmed went a little further, saying that in 1891, according to the vaults and inspirations he received, he died of a death of course, as did other nebîtes, and that God sent him as a mess and a metaphor that Christians and Muslims expected.
By contrast, Muslims are expected to be the same person as Muslims, and that is Mirza Gulum Ahmad Koran.
(Scottish Ansylopaedia, TDV)
In India, which was completely under British rule after the 1857 Sipahi uprising, Gulâm Ahmed, who has written books defending persecuted Muslims against Hindu and Hrisitians, is a reminder of the Gulen portrait, which is thought to have been founded entirely with mouthwatering saints, but is defending Isis against religiosity with the head of the Association Against Communism in Erzurum, whose CIA support later emerged.
Like the same Gulen, Gulum Ahmed's favorite idea of the emperor is that "jihad" is a struggle of Muslims with only his own self, and that there is no dimension to fighting emperor if he is able to live his religion freely.
Even if you remember, Gulen went a step further, praising the attacks of the Hindus, whose wounds in our history are still clear, in a 'promise' last year. "It is not very dangerous for the Hindus to invade your country.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
Once, they are not connected to your woman, your daughter.
Mabedinze don't have a relationship, they're unmarried Hindus!
The idea that Mehdi and his prophecy were united in themselves, that his own community would be the rescuers of Isis, that the concept of jihadist was just as similar to that of the FEMA, and that the spread of Women was generally carried out in the field of education and civil society.
The total number of women in the world, said to number more than 2 million, stands at 1869, while the emergency aid organisation "Humanity First" is officially recorded at 23.
In addition, there are 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 in 55 countries, 8 mattresses for Women in Africa alone; 505 educational institutions in 11 countries; and about 16,000 mosques around the world.
Bearing in mind that Prof. Abdusselam, the "first Muslim scientist" to receive a Nobel prize, and Sir Zaferullah Han, who served as president of the United Nations Court of Justice, are also Women, "the Muslim actor" Mahershala Ali, who won the first Oscar, "we can see more clearly the depth of global powers' approval of the Women.
Let's note that last week's meeting with 30,000 people in the UK was also brilliant as a show of skill.
A brief look at their history is enough to understand that one of the Slogangers, "Don't love everyone, don't hate anyone," is actually meant to say "love your occupants / exploits."
It is possible to drive the exit point and motivations of structures such as Hulasa, FETO or Tahir-ul-Kadri up to the Women's March, and all of these organisations are actually supported by a parade of empowerment and a matrix to disrupt communities in order to serve colonialism.
Kargodan's "last ambition" comes out
Emily Pomeranz (50), who spent her final days in a Washington hospital due to Pankreas cancer, expressed her apology for the breakfast and chocolate-mix milkshake (sugary drink) of a restaurant in the town where she was born.
A friend of the woman was alerted to the owner of the restaurant Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who has run the same restaurant for 47 years, put a dry bucket on his drink and also paid a fee of $123 (£435 TL), making his way to the hospital 600 miles away with a "fast-handed" carpenter.
Ahmet Kul on two new projects
Ahmet Kul Construction, which has implemented major projects so far, including Lavinya Park, Otoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, has put up for sale Dia Mare in Istanbul Mimaroba and Solse 7 in Bodrum Yalcavak.
The geometry of the Dia Mare project, developed by the architecture firm Calamoglu Architecture, was developed to receive maximum benefit from the sea.
Positioned on an 11,000-square-foot area, Dia Mare has a total of 188 homes and 17 commercial units.
The project, whose cabin structure is completely finished, is due to be handed over to new owners on March 2018.
There are several types of apartments in Dia Mare, ranging from 2 + 1 to 5 + 1.
It will activate two new sites in Mimaroba and Bitez later this year, and is set to sign up for 2 major projects in Topkapi in 2018.
He has transferred $753 m to favored companies
Peace said many programs were commissioned outside at TRT, which employs 6,760 staff, and flying prices were paid.
"In TRT 2016, the nation's taxes again went after AKP companies," he said.
"The name of this is robbery," he said....
TRT's funding for the favored production companies was revealed by data from official documents.
The official response to an application by CHP MP from Istanbul, Peace Youssef, within the framework of the Freedom of Information Law demonstrated how TRT's resources were spent.
He said that at TRT, where 6,760 people work as cadres, a full 753,500,000 TL was transferred to favored companies in 2016 through programs commissioned under the name of external construction, although there are all technical possibilities.
"What this means is a hit," the CHP MP said.
"The production companies of AKP journalists and businessmen are plundering TRT," he said.
"Millions are being paid for productions that are not watched or whether they are filmed," he said.
"The institution, which has 7,000 staff, has returned to the purview of the AKP," he said, recalling that the money allocated to the companies was collected from the public's taxes.
"What programs did these companies sign up for or get that money that 7,000 people couldn't do?" He responded.
TRT's advertising revenue in 2016 was 224,456,182 TL, he said, adding that when staff salaries and other expenses were taken into account, advertising revenue remained a listen to the gig.
"TRT, which has become the voice of the AKP, also cannot get advertising because it is not being watched," he said.
Nutritionist journalists receive money from TRT, while the AKP makes a swastika on its behalf.
"The nation is bearing the burden," he said.
"TRT gives staff an annual salary of 660 m euros, but it gives all things to foreign productions," he added.
From TRT, that is, the public's pocket has gone after 753.5 trillion supporters.
This is wholly reprehensible.
He kneeled and apologized in front of his wife, who was reeling from suicide
The incident took place at noon today in a parking lot on Eyupoglu Mahalla Not-for-profit Street.
Residents who saw the resident, who swooped below the 4th floor of the parking lot, reported the situation to firefighters and paramedics, sources said.
Firefighters rushed to the area where the man was found, and paramedics were on hand.
Yunus G., a 34-year-old father of 3 who was stopped from committing suicide after nearly an hour of convincing efforts by psychologists and police officers who were called to the scene, took a knee and apologised in front of his wife, N.G, who watched him in tears.
Meanwhile, about 100 people sat on the sidewalks on the street of Yunus G, the site of the attempted suicide, while some residents registered with mobile phones.

Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will not change soon, after slow economic growth and mooted inflation reduced speculation that there will be an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue "slowly," with family income shrinking and themselves keeping interest rates steady.
Decision-makers on the Bank's Parasal Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep rates at 0.25%; thus, fewer members asked for an increase this month after slow economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that household incomes will continue to shrink as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in the spring.
But he signaled that rate rises are needed to rein in inflation fuelled by Brexit over the next few years, and said borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted in the wake of Brexit to withdraw some of the massive economic healing package launched a year ago.
The bank will terminate its period funding Plan, which offers cheap financing to banks from next branch, but said it expects it to offer £15 billion more under the plan (a total of £115 billion).
"In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains slow in the short term, with the reduction of household real incomes continuing to burden consumption," the Bank said minutes after the interest decision was made.
On rates, he stressed that "some downturn in monetary policy" could be necessary to ease inflation and would be "a piece higher" than the market expected.
Markets are still predicting that the first increase will be in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stresses that any increase would be "step by step" and "limited."
According to May estimates, the bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and next are comparable to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank maintains its forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro after the news.
The Pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change came after GDP fell 0.2% in the three months leading up to 0.3% in the second quarter, easing expectations for a multiplied increase in the disappointing latest growth figures.
Growth will probably remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but according to the bank, it will start to increase lightly by the end of the year.
While the Bank says the recession will worsen before recovery, the latest inflation report leaves little joy for households hit by rising inflation and cliff-edge pay rises.
The Bank said monetary policy could not "prevent" revenues from being hit over the next few years, but it expected wages to recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.
Increased demand for UK goods as a result of the weak pound will support the economy by balancing some of the dwindling consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% last August following a shock EU referendum vote that took the pounds to a head.
The Bank estimates it will likely take four years for it to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank's most recent interest decision, there was a rising demand for an interest rate hike, with increased inflationary pressure on struggling households and a call by three policymakers for an increase in the rate to 0.5%.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in July to 2.6% last month, but the bank said it was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the vaccination, based on their 2% target, was "entirely" related to the powerhouse pound.
Andrew Montlake, a director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent declines in swap rates, when there is a demand for borrowers to do business and close the syndicate in a positive way, once again the mortgage market will become even more competitive.
Sunday; on remortgages, for those nearing the end of their current contract, the ticket looks good, with a lot of free opioids and low rates, making it even more popular than ever, "he said.
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
In the High Court, patients will be able to access' convertible 'HIV prevention treatment from September after a battle to fund the drug on the NHS.
NHS England has announced that its pre-exposure prognosis (PrEP), a habit taken before the eighties, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk people by around 86 per cent, will be provided by health services to up to 10,000 people estimated through a 3-year pretrial.
The High Court's ruling last year agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld the ruling, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP, despite claims by local authority to fund it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was welcomed by Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, as a 'new and serious intervention', with the National AIDS Trust (NAT) describing it as a 'turning point'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to register the public, with more clinics participating in the eclipse being fully implemented across the UK by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prognosis (PrEP) is a series of HIV drugs that reduce the risk of contracting HIV before the eighties.
Experiments showed PrEP significantly reduced HIV transmission among those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP first of all means finding enough of the medications to prevent the placement of HIV infection in a person's body.
Such medications can be taken every day or until just two hours before sex.
Those eligible for treatment are Gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those who have HIV-positive partners and cannot be treated successfully.
The clinics will determine eligible participants who will settle for the experiment from men, women, transgender individuals and unknown people whose partners are controlled by an anti-retroviral treatment for HIV.
People who live in the UK and are registered with a practitioner's dentist will also be able to register for potential participation in participating local sexual health clinics.
The programme will cost £10 m and NHS England internationals have signed a deal to provide the drugs this week in an offer-only tender.
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how PrEP is targeted, conducted and applied on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This new and serious intervention will contribute to extensive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in three decades of development when it comes to subverting one of humanity's key health problems, 'he said.
Deborah Gold, head of NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: 'This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If it is properly targeted in those in need and those at risk, PrEP offers the possibility of transforming the HIV epidemic in the UK.
Starting in September, people at high HIV risk will reach a new, powerful tool in the UK, funded by the NHS, that is indeed privately controlled to the person and not open to negotiation with a wife; this will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. '
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority now should be to ensure that the experiment is presented quickly across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP experimental drug has been cleared, we are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV. '
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow public health minister, said: 'We welcome that the PrEP experiment has begun and it has been late with months of delays and then the government dragging its feet.
Evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our look at preventing HIV and in terminating the inflammation of this life-changing infection.
The experiment will bring us a step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this experiment is presented as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us a step closer to finishing the spread of HIV in society.

Two schizophrenic deaths
Umit Makbule Chilingiroglu (51), the daughter of former Industry and Trade Minister Ayhan Chilingiroglu, who was born in Washington, died in Istanbul Levent, falling from the 19th floor of a business centre also used as a hotel.
A student at Koc University, 24-year-old Melis Salihoglu, was also found dead at his home.
He said he was astonished.
A review has been launched into two schizophrenic deaths in pedestrians, which have been deemed suicide by police.
'DEPRESIF HAL.'
Turkey's first Minister of Industry and Trade, Ayhan Chilingiroglu, who served in the Nihat Erim government in 1971, was born in Washington in 1966, and his daughter, Umit Makbule Chilingiroglu, entered the Le Meridien Otel in Ealing at about 11pm on August 1st.
An ambulance and police team were called to the scene after a Kuwaiti tourist who settled in the room on the 19th floor and saw the cliff of Chilingiroglu, who had not been notified of him for some time, informed hotel management.
The medical team determined that Chilingiroglu, who fell on rough ground from the 19th floor, had died.
"Recently there was a warehouse version," his mother, Mediha Chilingiroglu, told police.
He arrived in Istanbul from Ankara on July 31st.
I have a grandmother with leukemia who is from my other daughter.
"This was interested in my grandmother and she was negatively affected by my grandmother's illness," he said.
Chilingiroglu, whose funeral was taken to the Forensic Medicine Institute, is expected to be buried in Ankara.
It is being investigated whether Chilingiroglu was thrown by someone or committed suicide.
'CANINA KIYDI 'IDDIASI
The other suspected death in Istanbul was in Sariyer Zekeriyaky.
Melis Salihoglu (24), a student at Koc University, was found dead at his home.
The teenage girl's father allegedly went to her daughter's home, close to school, where she was unable to get news and could not get access to her mobile phone.
The father met his daughter's cat in the house.
Melis, who is well-loved by his family, close circle and friends, said he ended his life by hanging himself in his home.
Melis Salihoglu's death drove his family and relatives into law.
After Melis, a friend wrote on social media: "A pale sun was hitting our face."
Under our feet, Yemgreen grass was in the place of our Keys as our best friend Jack and sister went after that little plastic ball with Eyshan.
"What was needed is now to die," he shared the message.
Living the luxurious life: Astounding and smart design numbers have transformed this tiny Earls Courts apartment into a ferocious home.
Former banker Joanne Leigh, who has a passion for real estate, went from a vast house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014 and went on to shrink.
It's on the first floor of a glamorous Queen Anne-style tartan and proof of the new design that Joanne is convinced without collecting her blonde locks.
"Before that, I was living in a much larger area in Knightsbridge with my old loved ones," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that coincided with my price.
The apartment on Earl Court was shown to me and had the same high ceiling.
I fell in love with him and made an offer that day. "
After the initial discussion, 1,000 FT chartered apartments were renovated from scratch.
Initially it was a one-bedroom and complex-plan property; you had to go through the kitchen to reach the bedroom, and Joanne wanted to add a storage area and an elevator to take maximum advantage of the generous ceiling high.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows and a lot of light.
That was my condition, "she says.
For that purpose, he hired Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to take advantage of the 12.5 FT ceiling and create not only a structure but also a place where Joanne would live.
The ceiling wasn't high enough to add two areas in a row, so the architectural challenge was to create an elevator that you could survive in.
Erfan should have thought in a creative way to resolve the matter.
"The steel skeleton is quite complicated," he explains.
"We should have adjusted the gaps so that they could have been put down without the need to go down on each other.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but the steel would have been such a focus that they would have been at the right height according to the top or bottom functions, "he said.
The arrangement also brought a lot of additional drama, allowing Erfan to get two full-length rooms above each other.
The old type of copper light pendant, taken from Retrouvius for asthma, looks at the magnificent living area below.
The gold-coloured furniture, silver shoes and the old type of Serge Mouille lighting all set the tone for the bill.
The use of the objects plays a role in adding the venue, the area and the light.
The mirrors placed on both ends of the short corridor make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the Ayr coronation panel gives a sense of the window that opens to another room.
The intrepid units provide a storage area for Joanne's entire cracked knife squad and her cleavage.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a perception of a more magnificent space, is to be able to cover the kitchen when it's not in use.
As soon as it opens, the kitchens are not new.
What is unique is that there is an upside-down door in the garage style.
"We used some engineering in it," Erfan explains of the steel-reinforced skin MDF door.
"There's a weight of balance, so when you push the door up, it really slips easily," he said.
With the wise use of the area and the storage area, Joanne earned an additional 16 square feet, an extra bedroom and an improved session plan.
"At the end of the day, it's what you're going to sell on the sidelines, or the value of your property is determined," says Erfan.
"As an Iptidai, an emperor will enter and make a calculation on the basis of the session space," he said.
They managed to use quality materials that gave the area a luxurious view while improving the ground space there.
"The ingredients are the objects you touch and thus help you build emotional bond at home," says Erfan.
"At home, you wouldn't fall in love with the power lines on the wall.
These are important, but they don't tidy the wire of your heart. "
This is the illusion that, through good design and upgraded square feet, an apartment can turn from a standard thing into something quite magnificent.
In fact, like Joanne, you might choose not to leave.
Jeremain Lens at Besiktas with bonus
After 1.5 months of talks, he moved to Besiktas with a Lens bonus, initially thought to be on loan.
Following talks that have intensified over the past week, Lens agreed with the Black Cats team for a fee of 5 m euros.
The Dutchman, who signed a 5-year deal, was found to receive 2.2 m euros annually.
Besiktas are expected to make an official statement on the transfer of Jeremain Lens.
Wedding photos of famous couples
Model Cagla Shikel and actor and singer Emre Altug, who have had an intriguing relationship for nearly 4 years, entered the world house in Sortie.
The couple were fatally stabbed with a photo of the wedding ceremony, which they said was "the most special moment of our lives."
The couple decided to split after 7 years.
Brothers fight for $500 m property empire
Forty years after the dynasty set up by Italian families, the two brothers are at war for one of Victoria's largest property empire, worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and builder Colin De Lutis lives three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who gave himself to the High Court on how to distribute property and business assets at a property in Toorak.
Paul had wanted to get out of the family business since 2014, but fierce debate was under way at the High Court over the breakup.
The boys, along with Annalise Anna, own 38 properties in Smith Street, Collingwood, worth more than half a billion dollars that have been accumulated since a shop they bought in 1973.
There, the family set up Westco Jeans and raised it to a company with 160 retail outlets.
In 1999, it sold for $85 million.
That money has been invested in the mound, and De Lutis's portfolio currently includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento builder sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartment buildings and shopping centres in the suburb.
As part of a deal with their father, who has passed away, Colin (described by Paul as a "significant driving force and a dominant person" in the De Lutis family) owns two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul a third.
A court filing says it means Colin is worth $316 million and Paul is worth $176 million.
For Paul, dividing the property and the naked is emerging as a contentious issue.
In his first yawning testimony to the court in 2015, he wrote: "The separatism proposed by Colin was leaving him with properties that I have always admired as the best of me."
After several failed attempts last Friday, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The boys are also in a fight over who will control the current job; Paul claims Colin left him out of the job.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetent managing some of the properties.
Colin says he hopes to resolve the dispute in a sloppy testimony he gave at the start.
"My Italian roots dictate to me that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of encrypted testimony, emails recorded by firms including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and charter Keck Cramer, and costs in the case, along with best lawyers such as Allan Myers, QC, and senior legal partners held by both sides, are on the rise.
She and her late husband Luigi were a family of Italian immigrants who operated groceries and singers from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They took Colin's property hostage to buy the Collingwood property, where the family opened their first jewel shop.
Colin says he set up Westco there "in my last years in high school, when Paul was a little boy (when he was 10)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hope to leave their own property in a friendly way to their son.
"Luigi would often tell me that she never wanted the boys to fall into court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis corporations group; when Colin left the job, he was paid $10 million to Mark and $26 million to Luke.
As Paul said, both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the terms of their financial divisions."
According to a 2015 biography of Eddi McGuire, the TV star's best friend, Colin tried not to draw attention despite being a former AFL club board member.
Fairfax Media communicated with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
"I can't say much," he replied, as the case was in court with only Colin text message.
"It has been very, very sad that my brother Paul prefers to sue me and take the name of our family to the courts," she wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court application that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father, Paul and I wouldn't want us to fall into the current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful about a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be lost.
"Our problem will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new private stronghold plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do that.
If it happens, it would be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House special item will restrict the flow of information to President Trump (including news media reports) in hopes of keeping the boss more stable.
Reporter: Some small information from Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House special counsel, met with senior staff on his first day in office, he summed up a fundamental problem that President Donald Trump plans to solve about the White House: Getting bad information into the hands of the president," he said.
Kelly explained to staff that information should flow through him, whether on paper or through briefing, because the president would have been able to make better decisions when he was given good information.
Kelly's description sounds very meaningful, but others have tried and failed to keep Trump awake by overseeing the media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and he's now in the White House, the TV watchdog is still in good shape.
A former campaign adviser, Sam Nunberg, told Politico in the branch: "If Aday Trump was sorry that he wasn't fairly involved in the media, it was a veritable boost to show him that he had a fair place in persuasive media outlets."
"According to six campaign officials, the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit in check was to ensure that personal media consumption included a steady flow of praise," Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time.
OK, I don't think it's going to be a good thing.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit is "under control" at any time is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something that the rest of us don't know, for instance, that Trump's tweets would be much more provocative if they weren't their interventions.
We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.
If his recruits were able to put him out of danger even a few times, then his efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from repeatedly stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem was that the White House was made up of services competing with each other, that is, people who, in any case, tried to advance their own agents with the material they presented to Trump (they could have been reliable or unreliable), and people who put their own world views forward.
Politico reported in May, throughout all this story, that advisers were strategically inclined to convey sceptical information to the president.
One example that reporter Shane Goldmacher described in detail:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump has reacted hypothetically to negative vouchers from the press, especially leaks that have had a bad impact, and is self-capitalizing on finding out where they were caused," he said.
That was when, at the end of February, someone gave the president a festive copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing the deputy special counsel, Katie Walsh, of being "the source behind a series of leaks" at the White House.
It was important that Johnson was essentially banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he did not present any concrete evidence, or that he had levelled fabricated accusations in the past, and that he had returned from them.
Trump read the article and started asking staff questions about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that then-special counsel Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter were "trying to put in place a system that is handling and documenting the paperwork that Trump has received."
How did this produce results?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
Maybe he will emerge as a more effective executive than Priebus, but Trump is still in his own laugh and his aides are still running for influence.
These variable factors will make Kelly's task quite difficult.
Kripto reveals her blonde locks in special shorts
Izmir State Prosecutor Berkant Karakaya has "wrapped up an investigation into alleged irregularities in the military spying investigation" and the leaking of some information, after a secret witness, code-named "sarcastic," told the Chief of Staff of the Naval Forces Command, Vice Admiral Cihat Yayci, that he was a FETO. "
The review highlighted that, contrary to the fact that Consumer Publishing is not a member of the organization, it has assisted the investigative body in defrauding members of the cricket organization in the Marine Corps command and has played an active role in the fight against FEMA.
The resolution pointed out that Yayci was ordered by the Marine Corps Command as required by the so-called martial law order in the coup attempt on July 15 and sought to be passionate, underlining that hers had fought effectively against FEMA from the first day of the coup attempt.
"It is clear that Publishing is working on the identification of members of the cricket Marine Corps, thanks to a special system for the identification of FEMA members from the cricket crown services class, as well as 64 basic criteria and 209 sub-criteria," the takeaway decision issued by Karakaya read.
It has been concluded that it is not possible for the public prosecutor to issue an assessment based on an analysis of hers, who is known to be an active terrorist organisation and has made a major contribution to the criminal investigation, as a result of a thorough and intriguing effort by the undercover witness, with no evidence against her, except for the affidavit and the fact that she was not based on a basis.
He was previously tried on charges of defamation.
Behind that was the revelation that there were still FEMA officers and that the alleged crime was knife-wielding.
Former Air Pillar Staff Colonel Hakan Dinc, who has been charged with insulting him, is the former Adana Incirlik 10, who turned the complaint, which is only in the form of an information rating, into a document.
Tanker base Commander Air Pillar Brigadier General Bakir Ercan Van, former Chief of General Staff Lieutenant Colonel Muharrem Kokse, who authorised the investigation, former Chief of General Staff Lieutenant General Mustafa Ozsoy, former Chief of Staff Major Erkan Ozsoy, former Marine Captain Necmettin Aksoy, who authorized the prosecution, former Chief of Staff Captain Akif Us and former Chief of Staff Serdar Ceamici, and former Chief of Staff Colonel Mustafa Cicek, who had been a witness against him. He was expelled from the TSK because of his links to FEMA.
Some members of the organisation, including Tuncay Opchin, a FEMA fugitive, were found to have targeted hers with their social media posts before and after the 15 July coup attempt.
Travelers surround henchman, return to 'rich neighbor'
Some of the West Midlands' richest landlords are in a fight again with the diminutive travelers who cross the council-excavated ditch to reclaim the space outside their own property.
Travelers parked 20 caravans outside an area of Solihull's version of which is Street on the ground and is referred to as the 'neighbourhood of the rich'.
They returned after being chased just in May, when the council brought in horses, babies and a slew of cargo cars, undaunted by the ditch it had excavated to cut off their influx.
Acting cleverly, the group found a vacuum in defence, infiltrating their vehicles by arranging a road through a section that had been left unbarricaded.
Angry residents slammed Solihull Council, saying it was' unhelpful in solving the problem '.
An anonymous caller said: "They arrived there on Monday evening after being sent from Bentley Heath where they threw stones at passers-by.
The council should be ashamed of its actions because they are unhelpful in solving the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were sent off and now they have come back again.
More came last night, and probably even more will come today. "
He added: 'Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it with long away decisions taken to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Street and I'm not happy to continue paying my tax while the council can't even stop it.'
One area resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'Like a joke, we've seen the last group of travelers leave yet and we've just been devastated by a new group.
Their number has increased this time, and it has even been found that a horse has been parked in the parking area. '
A female spokesman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware that there is an unauthorised camp on Streetsbrook Street land, we are launching the legal proceedings necessary to send them away as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many area residents as we can call 101 and report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police.
This will help to figure out the picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to the court. '
Galatasaray report Ndiaye to the stock market
According to a statement sent to Borsa Istanbul from the Galatasaray sportswear and Commercial Investments, the club will pay Osmanagic 7,500,000 euros for the player's bonus and 750,000 euros if he plays a total of 25 games in the league, the cup and Europe, and another 50,000 euros if he plays another 50 games.
Galatasaray will also pay a guaranteed fee of 11 m euros for Ndiaye, under which he signed a 4-year contract, including 2,750,000 euros for each year.
In addition, Ndiaye will be fined 5,000 euros for each score received by the yellow-card team during their matches in the TFF Super League and UEFA competitions.
It also announced that the player had the right to unilaterally terminate the contract for 18 m euros from June 15, 2019.
The last day is tearful!
They flocked to fire stations
Thousands of vehicles were damaged in Istanbul last Thursday as a result of the storm and torrential rains.
Many of the drivers who reported from firefighters to cover the damage by insurance companies have made their notifications, while drivers who have not reported so far have queued up for the report.
Drivers who do not have a chasm or notification today have arrived at fire stations and requested a report, as this is the final day of reporting time.
Today is the last day
Drivers first took photos of their vehicles to fire officers to identify the damage to their vehicles.
Drivers with damage to their vehicles were later able to report to officers.
Hasan Erol, who arrived at the fire station for the report, said, "I will be photographed when I register."
When I arrived, there was intensity.
"There was damage to the front glass," he said.
"We came to the second round," said driver Erbil Kilic.
We are in line.
We were photographed.
"Now we will wait for the report," he said.
Skyscrapers with a wall between sea and snow don't breathe
"The expert report in the case clearly says these structures will not withstand a magnitude 6 earthquake," CHP Parliament Speaker Nadir Ataman said, warning of an earthquake related to huge structures rising on the coast.
The solid slide is between 25 and 30 metres underneath, and the excavations are not so compact.
The high-rise hotel and retreat on the coast of Istanbul, which bore a wall between sea and land, left the town needless.
Nadir Ataman, a member of parliament from the CHP's Baker Municipality, reacts to the huge AVM, hotels and regeneration projects in the county, one of which has risen to the next.
According to Ataman, the structures on the beach cut off the winds. "About 80 years ago, those who planned for the winds formed the Ataturk Forest in Floria.
How, 80 years later, a sense of urbanism was reached, they planted huge skyscrapers in the wind corridors and changed the climate.
"It's not breathtaking in the city," he said.
Rising buildings, such as a wall, have changed the climate's balance, Ataman said. "Because of skyscrapers, the temperature is felt 10 degrees higher," he added.
These buildings need to be made based on the direction of the wind.
But our skyscrapers rise above the wind corridors of Istanbul.
The wind can't get inside the county.
These structures disrupt the balance of natural life.
Ataman said these skyscrapers, which harm the environment and human health, also cut off the Bakersfield residents' connection to the sea, adding that they would appeal to the Anthem Council on the matter and seek justice.
Unsurgical treatment is possible in the return of the knife.
Cases of Fenol practice show success of up to 83%.
In this method, the illuminated tissue is effectively cleaned up and the tissue vacuum is filled with an agent who kills chest slaves.
Another of the therapeutic techniques for the return of non-alcoholic cats is the lactose method.
The various lamps and the fabric around them are burnt out thanks to the authentic spread of light, which allows the tomatoes to be made and shut down at the time of the burn.
Patients can return to social and business life as soon as possible, thanks to these two non-surgical methods of breast cancer.
Overweight, inactive living, long-term sitting and doing business, intense hair and vomiting, and failure to comply with hygiene rules have led to a return, Dr Mert Atak said, adding that symptoms of the disease include pain, infection, apnea and inflammation in the bloodstream.
Italy toughens NGOs' approach to migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue if they fail to comply with new rules affecting their operations.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new statute, it will be difficult to see if they continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat operated by German charity Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actively cooperating with human traffickers to facilitate illegal immigration.
The charity, which has been active for just a year, declined to comment on the content of the detailed charges brought against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
In a statement on social media, the agency said: "Saving human life for us is and will be our most important priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot work in the search and rescue area right now."
"Only after we gather all the information and make an assessment of the situation can we make an assessment of the charges that are currently being made."
Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, Iuventa, since October.
The crew is suspected of boat the tyre bottles of migrants delivered direct to them by human traffickers and allowing smugglers to escape by boat, for reuse.
According to the prosecutor's files, published by Italian media, at least one such meeting took place about 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast.
The crew is suspected of undermining the authority of the Italian coastguard, which is overseeing rescue operations in the region due to humanitarian efforts rather than any other purpose.
Under the Charter, boats such as Iuventa were supposed to be an Italian police officer who was clearly monitoring their activities on the deck.
Of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations, only three have so far agreed to comply with the charter: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latest said on Tuesday that it had assessed the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable because they would not cause any "serious changes or obstacles" to its own rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy after last week's Rescue is a sign that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguard and co-operation with local governors are bearing fruit.
He said: "In recent days we've got to see the light at the end of the tunnel."
This month, he announced plans to hold more talks with Libyan governors on economic development initiatives and to take measures with Chad, Nijer and Mali to reduce the number of migrants leaving in hopes of reaching Europe.
Last-minute punch!
In Moscow, Russia, the celebration of the "day of parishioners" beats carpets, as is the case every year.
He attacked Russian NTV television reporter Nikita Razvozjayev, who attended the event and was broadcast live at a Russian Gorki Park, where she overdosed on alcohol.
Quoting the arrival of the day in a live broadcast, the reporter warned the man, who had a moment of grief and defiance and shouted, "We are going to bruise Ukraine," to "please get thirsty."
The heartbroken man, identified as the former paratrooper, threw a hard punch at him after the reporter warned him.
The reporter, who was hospitalized with a drunken coughing he received, tried to get away from the man.
Millions of people watched the shocking moment on the live stream.
Economic Co-ordination Council meets
The Economic Co-ordination Council (EKK) met under the chairmanship of Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek, who is in charge of the economy.
The first meeting of the EKK, chaired by Simsek after a reshuffle of the government, opened at 11pm at the Cankaya Palace.
The meeting will focus on Turkey's macroeconomic outlook.
The meeting, chaired by Simsek, was attended by Finance Minister Naci Abal, Science, Industry and Technology Minister Faruk Celik, Labour and Social Policy Minister Juplide Sarieroglu, Customs and Trade Minister Bulent Tufenkci, Development Minister Lutfi Elvan, Treasury Minister Osman Celik, Central Bank Governor Murat Cetinkaya and related bureaucrats.
It's possible to get rid of the label in 45 minutes
According to Dr Oguz Karaeminoglou, only 5 per cent of patients need surgery to treat the fever. "According to the results of the examination and examination of the patient, the first step is exam and medication treatment," he said.
Oguz Karaeminoglou says that entrepreneurial methods (such as epidural injections, radiofrequency techniques, disc-induced initiatives) should be tried in the patient group, where pain persists. "If there is no success in all these methods, if the disability and weakness in the leg becomes clear, then surgery becomes mandatory," he warns.
Karaeminoglou explained that the 'full-door backlash surgery', which minimises the risk today, also allows patients who fail to achieve results through entrepreneurial methods to reduce their reservations about surgery, adding that it is possible to get rid of the fever in 45 minutes.
Although microscopic surgery has had quite good results compared to open surgery, after the operation it can face some complications, such as a long recovery period, shoulder fractures, a repeat of fever, and a backslide and infection that could develop in the future.
Often microscopic surgery is described as' indoor surgery ', but microscopic surgery is applied with the same approach as open surgery.
In full indoor backup surgery, these risks disappear because the surrounding tissue is protected.
The full indoor backflip surgery takes just 45 minutes.
Special commission on the job
The commission will include CHP deputies Mehmet Gokdag, Cemal Okan Yuksel, Peace Yellow and Higher Disciplinary Board member Turan Aydogan.
The commission said Berberoglu was arrested on October 4th in Istanbul's 14th District.
His hearing at the Supreme Court will also follow applications to the Supreme Court and the District Court of Appeals.
"It is an indispensable condition for justice for the judiciary to be independent and impartial, not to take orders from anywhere outside the law," CHP Secretary-General Kamil Oktay Cetin and Deputy Chairman Bulent Tezcan wrote in the memo.
"Our MP, Mr. Enis Berberoglu, did not request any special status while serving as a member of parliament, did not seek the immunity granted by his MP, and sought to maintain his faith in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary," it said.
The trial process suggested that the court preferred to enforce political orders rather than conduct a trial.
The article argued that the fact that the Constitutional Court had decided to arrest lawmakers without a verdict, despite rulings that found their arrests wrong, was clear proof that the court had decided under the influence.
Michelle Carter sentenced over messages encouraging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been jailed for two-and-a-half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through messages and phone conversations.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and serve five years as a legalized eviction.
Carter was convicted in June of the murder of Conrad Roy in a cab in his own lifetime on July 13, 2014.
Mr Roy's father told the hearing on Thursday: "My family's heart is broken.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free while his way to the station was open.
Although he faced a maximum 20-year sentence, his legal team had argued that both he and Mr. Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Carter, wearing a red pantsuit and cream-coloured bluff, was with older eyes as he was punched, his hands on the edge and his eyes were in the shape of a look on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
He ended his life in order to improve his instinct.
He did not accept responsibility, "he said.
"He didn't show any remorse at all," she said.
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was horrific that he was completely remorseful."
But Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not see him "having any significant impact on the actions of his age, level of maturity, even mental illness."
A prosecutor read a statement by Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said: "There is no day, I will not mourn the loss of my dear son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I have overcome everything, and I am trying to be with her sisters with all the pain we will carry forever, "she said.
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that the reality that she would never attend her brother's wedding, or that she would never still be to her children, was "out of her mind."
"The fact that that person I've been with every day since I was born is no longer a pain that will always be with me for the rest of my life," she said.
Because there is no Massachusetts law that makes it a crime to tell a person to commit suicide, the case looks like it will create a drink.
When Mr. Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014, Carter was 17.
The case attracted national attention when it was revealed that Carter's text messages encouraged him to terminate his own life.
While she was holidaying with her family, the girl sent several messages two weeks before her death, saying: "There is a lot of way to go, from a building to a laundry, self-stabbing, I don't know."
In the moments before his suicide, he wrote: "You should do this, Conrad" and "The only thing is to open the generator you need to do and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz ordered through the press not to be allowed to benefit from this case, saying Carter wanted to draw attention through Mr. Roy's death.
The case has divided legal views.
Among the minority defending Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her Briton room friend in Italy in 2007 before being lured two years ago.
Female Knox (30) published an article in the Los Angeles Times that said she disagreed: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not imprisonment."
Mehmet Simsek forecasts remarkable growth
In his statement, Simsek said inflation in Turkey should fall to low single-digit figures, and said food inflation posed a "risk area."
The Deputy Prime Minister predicts inflation will fall below 7 per cent in 2018.
In his speech, Simsek said:
The next 12 months are critical in reducing uncertainties.
The biggest incentive is to reduce uncertainties.
There is a strong government.
There is no political uncertainty.
I hope that the uncertainties in our recent geography will also decrease.
I believe that with some reform we will increase our resistance to shocks, which will put Turkey on a growth trend of more than 5%.
I told him months ago.
It's because the worst is behind us.
Slowly, we will no longer have our energy in those areas, but in the reforms that will bring our energy to inclusive growth, job growth...
That's why the next 12 months are critical.
Reform, on the one hand, has diminished uncertainties, and there is no political uncertainty.
If we have a chance to build, then the difficulties in our immediate geography will decrease.
Many of our classic markets have collapsed, even if we do not want to.
Libya is like Iraq.
We're not just losing Sunday, we're facing more than 3.5 million waves of immigration.
When we look at the past 15 years, Turkey has grown by 5.7 per cent, despite all these shocks.
Turkey, that is, we have solid problems.
Now, with some reform, we will increase our resistance to shocks and, in some cases, further address the questions on investors' heads, putting Turkey back on a policy of growth of more than 5%.
Let me be clear, from there, we have such a generous pension system.
I think it would be reasonable if I said our pension companies weren't doing enough.
Once, the performance in auto participation will be strong.
What is it?
Because we took precautions.
Firms don't have to go and make efforts and make massages.
We have taken into account these concerns, taking into account the poor performance and how we will allocate global assets to the investment areas.
You know in the Deposit, the yields are high.
Once clear, there will be a performance there, in addition to the 25% provided by the state.
The rest is in the treasury papers, and there is a low risk there.
When we look at the big picture, I think interest will increase in the coming period.
Because they will see the performance.
It's not a failure in the other area, it's a success.
We restructured BES in 2013.
There are 6.8 million participants, a unit of 70 billion.
Give it the right, the system has been successful.
There are also 2.6 million participants in automatic participation, and 775 m euros are accumulated.
We want some more effort from the companies.
They're going to do a bit of publicity, they're going to tell this system.
We are working at the time of the backlash.
Maybe if we eschewed him a little bit...
We're going to look at it, we're working.
Maybe the citizens will see what they bring and stay in the system.
Opponents of the system are 38 per cent.
Almost half of those who leave are those with voluntary individual retirement.
You don't want two individual retirement accounts.
What do you do?
You're out of auto participation.
We were expecting a backlash of around 10% in nature.
There, I mean, we were very optimistic.
Once, the system works.
We brought a prime ceiling.
Insurance companies explain one-sided sometimes.
They have increased their premiums very quickly.
When asked what happened, they said that judicial decisions do not take into account existing regulations.
We have made a new clear arrangement.
And we've got to do what we need.
They said no, let's wait for the judiciary.
And we said, that wouldn't be the case.
We have differences of opinion here.
When the subject introduced this ceiling pricing, a number of firms were immersed.
We have had a new arrangement.
We created a pool of risky signifiers.
Let me tell you, I'm not going to be able to do it again.
I would prefer this system to work through competition.
So I don't get these ceiling price practices right, they obliterated us.
I would like to say, let's take a three-dimensional look at this incident.
Let the system that we do be taken into account.
Two, the system is normal business, a pricing on that patio.
The burden on him is severe, with almost 30 to 31 lira of every 100 lira paid going to tax SSC cuts.
And I'm working, right now, we're going to talk to our finance minister.
Thirdly, technology is evolving rapidly.
Now, over time, traffic accidents are structural, which will be severely reduced.
But this is mandatory traffic insurance.
Morning's headline saved his leg
Buerger disease, which originated from the age of adolescence, was formerly a discomfort in men, but today it is also often seen in women.
One of them is Mehtap Dursun, 36.
His pain, which began two years ago, was chronicled in his foot.
The young woman, who was forced to walk, was walking the hospital hospital when she was at risk of losing her leg.
A friend suggested Dr Yusuf Kalko.
In the morning, the headline showed the news that 'Azerbaijan saved the life of the Minister of Emergency Situations'.
It was then that Dursun, who went to Kalko, struggled with Buerger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko took the young woman to emergency surgery.
Dursun, who survived his pain shortly afterwards, is now being treated for oxygen.
Car Producers face Ters backlash, Audi to Provide 85 mph diesel Arrest Model
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of BMW's board of directors said he believed the firm had "more smart options than driving limits," referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW's central (where diesel vehicles are considered to be banned or limited).
Daimler said on Tuesday it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the firms identified the moves as a recall.
European automakers have heavily encouraged the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But the nitrogen oxides exposed by diesel engines are cancer-constructive and can cause astonishment.
The cost of equipment that automotive companies must install to neutralise the pill smoke generated by diesel vehicles is also on the rise, making it difficult for the price of cars to remain competitive.
German automakers are facing scrutiny, and the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of shunning powerful car companies and ignoring the commodities of the problem.
Firms are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which conceals it uses the device, known as the illustrious device, to adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car is tested and relax it in normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in Audi's engine development department, the former head of the thermometer was arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and therefore is not protected against extradition and could be tried in the United States of America.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a German criminal investigation, including Volkswagen; authorities expanded the United States-based investigation after accusing Audi of installing a system to avoid emissions rules in Europe.
Audi's inclusion in the investigation could be heavy on Volkswagen: The luxury automaker has an excessive share of Volkswagen's profits.
It's a fishing jump for every see
The head of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association, Professor Yusuf Sukru Caglayan, has warned against jumping from 2 m to the heat, which is unsure of its depth.
Every year, thousands of people are at risk of paralysis due to bodily harm and shoulder damage due to diving into the heat waters.
Bow fractures most often develop on the 5th or 6th shoulder.
The characteristic of the snakes is that it affects the nerves that contribute to this level of cognitive and leg bleeding, as well as respiratory bleeding.
"The boomerang area, our costliest body in these types of accidents, is cut or squeezed by the shoulder, which is torn apart by a fracture, leaving it unfunctional," said Professor Cagney.
"The wrong first aid in shooting injuries can not only increase the damage to the wreckage, but also lead to death," he said.
Getting a fishing dash into the water ranks fourth in shoulder injuries.
The average age of those injured is 20-29 and the majority are male.
"Fishing should not be thrown into the unpredictable water," Professor Cagney said.
"No matter how well drunk it is, there could be a severe injury," he said.
Prof. Dr Cagney also recalled.
Depending on the level of the shoulder at the site of the damage caused to the injuries caused by the collision, different degrees of paralysis can occur in the skull and bones.
You may know swimming, but water can be deceptive.
The place that seems to be deep in you can be sanguine.
There has been a 70 per cent reduction in cases of fishing jumping into the heat, thanks to warning signs placed on the sea coast in the United States and Australia.
"In Turkey, 28 provinces are bordering the sea, but in places outside Istanbul, unfortunately, there is not a single warning sign," Professor Caglar said.
"In relation to these types of accidents that are life-threatening, every pre-summer city needs to have an attention-grabbing possession of information lights or information panels on beaches and pools under the health directorate, schools and social awareness project," he said.
Dr Kadir Kotil, chairman of the Turkish Association of Neurosurgery's Spinal and Performing Sinal Surgery Group, suggested that the samples be made in case of injuries.
112 should be sought as the first job at the time of the incident.
The bow should be kept as steady as possible, it should not be moved, it should be identified with a tough catch.
The airway should be cleared and the patient should be placed on the opposite side for the drenching of water fleeing the lungs.
It should not be kept out of the bathroom and sliced to evacuate the water.
The sugar disorder in the patient's paint should not be tried to fix.
His boobs may have been broken.
However, if the shoulder has not yet been damaged, the first aid and an impromptu position to be painted during the patient's move could cause broken bone fragments to pressure the shoulder and cut and damage it.
Provence ladder under threat of climate change
It had turned into a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is under threat of climate change.
Lavender is in decline due to drought-like conditions and disease-stricken insects, leading to a major headache for scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "The lagoon in Provence is ecologically endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which brought rain, much less in the spring and mostly in the fall.
It affects the life of the ladder.
There's also a small August Beach, which is a make-up harmless covering micro-bacteria, and it's very dry in the air, "she said.
And a lot of things are in jeopardy.
For perfume and cosmetics as much as it attracts holidaymakers, it's a stunning pursuit of lavender oil.
Eric Chaisse said: "While we should have very long plant heads with a few wide flowers, we have smaller, less developed or not at all, or weak heads.
So we have less aesthetic rainbow pieces, "he said.
The revised solutions include better water distribution and slowing down the bubble from the soil, but there is also a protective Fisheries and water mix to plants and developing more resistant species to dry conditions.
Journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
Staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually gather in the Bazaar to review the latest turmoil issued by organised crime in Sinaloa province, its corrupt officers and plans for unfinished drug wars to be featured in the newspaper.
But on this day, they came together to talk about their safety in the shadow of their own tragedies.
They were told it was important for them to change their routine.
Two senior journalists discuss what makes them feel safer: Bring their children to the office, the target of a 2009 hand grenade with them, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the black throne in front of the room: Damage, impartiality, allies.
They ask the Conservatives to propose names for each suite; there is no need for any blood, perceptions and internal voices are enough.
Journalists suspected of linking drug traffickers, politicians, business people, the government or cartels to wages are the bad man who has made it dangerous to write a list of Mexico's chaos in the newspaper.
There are no violent divides, the number of bodies is increasing across the country, and even more are journalists: According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 people have been killed since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and at least seven have died in seven counties so far this year.
Among the last dead are editor-in-chief and inspiration Riodoce founding partner Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez writes in one of his many books on narcotics violence.
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence is everywhere, with a large photograph of Valdez showing his middle finger hanging on the front of Riodoce's building with the word "Justice"; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts showing his smile, his glassy face and the Panama hat, his alametifaric.
The work takes place less than two months after his death; reporters talk about their common trauma, their nightmares, their sleepiness, their paranoia.
In 2010, a special federal prosecutor's office was established to handle journalist cases, but it prosecuted only two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce; though their hearts are broken, they insist on addressing the violence in Sinaloa, even though the ground is now more deceptive.
Without information about the killers, without justice, it does little to discuss security, "Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to spend my time in this study," she says.
"As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone," he said.
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the provincial capital.
The red Toyota Corolla was able to take only a few blocks before being stopped by two men; he was forcibly removed from his vehicle and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of his newspaper, which translates as Onikinci Nehir.
The armed man got into his car and drove away and crashed the vehicle nearby.
Valdez was 50.
He is survived by his wife and two adult children.
In Culiacan, gossip tends to circulate freely.
But when it comes to Valdez, there's nothing more than just silence.
After Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in the octagon, Sinaloa became one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival groups fought to fill the gap.
Empty the street in Sinaloa every day for one or many people to be shot and killed, or for the cemetery to be filled with larger mosaics of drug kingdoms than many houses that are decorated, two-storey, to live.
For a minute, forget the state of "tranquility," where only one cartel controls precious ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Despite this, and despite being aware in depth of the dangers of Valdez's job, Riodoce's founding partner and director Ismail Bojorquez (60) was devastated by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes the two hubs contributed to the murder.
The first was an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival cartel groups that was in battle with Guzman's sons during a broadcast in the branch.
This article may have angered the sons; the probable gang members bought every copy of the raid as soon as it was distributed to the newspaper ladies.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper containing the same story was seized.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing was seen as a turning point in the violence of Mexico, which is against journalists.
He survived for a very long time, his friends and colleagues always fared he would be there.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste in 2013 when he joined his five colleagues by selling shares of $50 in the discovery of Riodoce.
"It was impossible to do journalism without addressing the issue of narcotics," Bojorquez said in Sinaloa.
Over time, the newspaper gained prominence for its bold and honest coverage, and with the sale, advertising increased.
Reporters were thrilled to publish life-saving research without fear of censorship, and readers covered themselves in a publication where they were able to read stories that no one dared to communicate.
Eight years after its creation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for journalism in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists because the Mexico drug story had the courage not to go after the daylight regardless of where it was based.
He acknowledged that he was clearly scared.
"I want to keep living," he said during the CPJ awards.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a lifeline," Rompeviento said in an interview with TV.
"As a journalist, you must accept the duty that falls on you. You either play this or stupid.
I don't want to ask me, 'What are you doing in the face of so many deaths... why don't you say what's going on?'
Riodoce staff miss Valdez; the sheriff, who rode like a hairdresser, his friends, who are generous in their embrace and teaching, their teachers who know how to survive...
They relied on his routine.
He was always wearing his hat.
He went to the bar, El Guayabo, opposite the office and would always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Has his love for his routine been his collapse?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and survive.
"If you're dealing with their women, their children, their clean work, the secret airplanes they use to transport drugs, they don't like it," he said.
"These things were to cross the border," Bojorquez said.
The result was a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation, even at the best time.
It's about relying on their own instincts.
If bad smell is coming, it's far away.
"The smell is a sentiment that can be deceptive... and it was what happened to Javier," Riodoce editor-in-chief Andres Villarreal said.
He and others say the old rules do not apply in Sinaloa; they do not apply to the same Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other counties that are home to carbon smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials, a toxic mix...
The ground is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce staff meet for security training; days ago, it was revealed that spy software sold only to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers wanted to avoid the 104-degree (40 degrees Celsius) temperature, in the shadow of a tree.
They were allocated by the provincial government to protect Riodoce's office, located in a four-story building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
The half-joke was semi-serious, with some of the reporters wondering whether these officers were from police inside 50 per cent, which the governor himself said was unreliable.
The reporters were months away from going to the mountainous countryside, where drug gangs are de facto controlled.
In this week's edition, Riodoce irons three main stories.
The brother of former major boxer Julio Cesar Chavez had his murder in Sinaloa.
In addition, the governor had disclosures of government spending focused on his hometown.
Then there was the kidnapping of a group at Culiacan's most expensive restaurant, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official explanation of who was kidnapped or how, so when it came time to write that everyone in the city knew about it, caution prevailed: The restaurant was the eyes of both drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the administration, which has dominated almost all levels of politics over the past century.
Recently, many PRI governors have been accused of corruption in sensational incidents.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about earlier incidents at that scene, including the escape of one of "El Chapo" Guzman's sons in a troop raid.
Just months ago, readers would look at Valdez's corner for information provided from the best source about the kidnapping.
"We already knew what had happened before," said Villareal (46), nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his intricate structure.
"At the moment, all our communication channels with our resources have been cut off," he said.
As staff turn to something they never expected, activists on behalf of the press, Valdez's office is being reused as a warehouse for banner and stickers protesting journalist killings.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez covered a few panels and took to the demonstration the next morning for another journalist in the local prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body has been found and, according to DNA tests, official officers say it was that.
Journalists across the country have been more vocal in their views, writing "help the press" to sidewalks and buildings in organised protests.
Today, director Bojorquez is in Washington, far away, trying to secure international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Sinaloa governor at the end of the day Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that day, he asked to be appointed to a post other than to make government coverage, thinking that his anger was undermining his impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organised crime, criminal partner official officials and an uncaring community.
In his latest book, "Narko-journalism," he wrote that journalists are being killed not only by drug gangs, but by the orders of politicians and security forces in co-operation with organised crime.
Media observer group Articulo 19 linked more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and official officials.
"You die in Mexico because they would like to silence you," Ramirez said.
The killings have clearly had a cold shower effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border province of Tamaulipas.
His body was found along with a note said to have been signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my reports."
A computer knife and ear are serviced next to his snatched head.
In the northern border province of Chihuahua, some publications such as El Norte opted to close after reporter Miroslava Breach was killed in March.
Others remain, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after his directors were killed in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed drug cartels with an editorial on his front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their own province, or even the country.
It's a neck-and-neck decision.
It's hard to find a job in exile, and they're still scanning the streets waiting for danger.
Sometimes they are seized, as evidenced by photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in a Mexico City apartment with four women in 2015, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue to work, it's a dance every day with these high-risk decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, says reporting the drug trade scares her.
"Mexico is going to hell and I was a reporter for that reason," he said.
At midnight on a recent Saturday, as preparations were made for the final number to be finished, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, while simultaneously stealing phones.
A series of armed clashes involving rival gangs and security forces near Mazatlan, a resort on the coast, have resulted in 19 confirmed deaths.
As promised in a series of cartel messages in the surrounding area, the war was continuing to escalate.
Through mobile phones on the sidewalk, they put the news on Riodoce's website.
The front page would have had to be changed the next day.
The sirens started kissing nearby, there's a confrontation with another gun in the surrounding area.
Bojorquez quickly turned a blind eye to the police officers who stood guard to see if they were vigilant.
If they were afraid, they didn't even show up.
Under a huge portrait of the newcomer founders of his newspapers, his central involvement was on display for all of Sinaloa to see, while Riodoce's cast was following in his footsteps.
"How can you think about closing down," Bojorquez said, "on the day Javier was killed, when the intern asked me to send him outside to report him on the street?"
He used camouflage to avoid dinosaur enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, but it's a horrible one.
The researchers have now announced that the first findings of an incredible creature in the size of the germ found by a Canadian mine are very well preserved, with experts describing it as "Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
They were so well protected that they could understand that the pine pine compound was broken brown and they could say it had a 'troubled history'.
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as' one of the best preserved armoured dinosaur found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world '.
The fossil is a newly found nomadic species that lived 112 million years ago in 110 million provinces, starting in the middle of the Kretase Dam.
His exceptionally well-maintained condition stunned researchers who described him as' really harrowing '.
The plant-eating armour is the best maintained fossil found in its species, according to reports in National Geographic.
He was found by Shawn Funk while excavating the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta Canada on March 21, 2011.
He hit something that seemed strange, according to the slide around him, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
They spent the next 6 years exposing the wildanimal from inside the 2500 pounds (110kg) of soil.
After such intense work, the complete result is now ready to be revealed.
Lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display, said: 'If you cut your eyes a little bit, you can even believe it's almost away.'
'It's one of the most beautiful in science history and, as the best preserved dinosaur species, it will pass as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, 'she said.
By studying its compound, the researchers found that even though it was covered in zest and resembled a walking tanka, this plant food probably faces a serious threat from dinosaurs who eat meat.
He used his red and white camouflage to hide from the dinosaur slopes, which were quite heavily armoured, and used a protective technique, also used by many present-day animals, known as plush-shaming.
Experts say it has been intercepted by larger dinosaurs, allowing it to better interfere with its surroundings and circumvent its enemies.
The creature, from the 1 million-year-old nodozor family, first made headlines in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The researchers have now finished their work, and they have named the wildcat Borealopelta markmitchelli, which is ithmetic to museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of the team that has spent more than 7000 hours laboring to expose it.
The extraordinary preservation of the species made it possible for Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists to document the shape and shape of the pulses and the brutality on the body.
The animals discovered to overshadow the plume, which is a common method of defense in algae and means that the upper part of the creature is more sheer than the lower.
Contra shaming is common, but the findings come as a surprise because the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the plywood-shaved animals that are alive today.
This means that the dinosaur is sufficiently pressured and hunted by dinosaurs who eat meat, and that evolution is enough to face hiding as a way of survival.
But the most contemporary animals that use plywood shade (mesh geese, zebra or armadillo) are much younger and much more open to being a hunter; it means that this noodle has faced a serious challenge to survive.
'The strong hunting on a huge, heavily armoured animal shows just how dangerous dinosaur slopes in Kretase can be, 'Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their Pulses also revealed that the dinosaur's compound is fractured brown.
To find out what he was eating at his last meal, scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about his life, including preserved coral content.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and plunged into the sea, plunging into a backward ocean surface there.
At the time, Alberta was as warmer as South Florida is today, and probably rivers and ocean were spreading far more content than it is now.
"Nodozor is really remarkable because it is completely covered and preserved with pulmonary compound, but also because the original shape of the animal is preserved in a 3-dimensional way," Brown said.
'The result is that the animal looks almost identical today to what it looks like in the early period Kretase.
You don't need much imagination to rebuild it; if you cut your eyes a little, you can even believe it's almost away.'
Kretase was the time when giant teropaurs, the meat oily dinosaurs standing two feet above, were touring on Earth.
Although the king of all, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armoured dinosaur Borealopelta, which may have been hung by a number of voluminous ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, a cannon weighing 38 FT (11.5 m) long, 6 tonnes.
The scientists, whose most recent findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was dragged into the sea after his death and mummified in mud.
Yarwaste was found by Shawn Funk while excavating the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, the best maintained armoured dinosaur, including leather and zip, is this and is complete from the neck to the heart.
On average, Yarwaste is around 18 FT. (Five metres) and weighs up to 3000 poles (130kg).
He has 2 20-inch-long paint coming out of his shoulders.
Researchers believe this armour obsession is hanging around where it is now Western Canada until it is dragged into the open sea by a submerged river.
But the dinosaur's submarine tomb maintained its cleavage in excellent detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular species are so well preserved that the leather parts still cover tall zip layers along the dinosaur's head.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, to this extent a reporter "is as naïve as winning the lottery.
The more I look at him, the more incredible he is.
Fossilised leather pieces still cover tall zip layers that are spot-on in the dinosaur's head.
His right front leg stretches along his side, his 5 involvement squared upside down.
I can count the pulses on my foot. "
Don't be out of your teeth when I'm a Beyoncé
Bemwhite femininity and an aesthetic smile are every person's dream.
As people turn to all means to crawl their teeth, Nukhet Berk, president of the Association of Oral Lazer Applications, warns that products sold in the brand or on the internet should be kept away.
Such substances sold line the Mine surface, rendering the teeth in a way that will not be recycled again, Nukhet Berk says. "The cramping of things can be provided with chemical substances applied by dentists, or with fine porcelain floors that are made like squirrels stuck on the surface of the teeth," he said.
Protecting dental health prevents many diseases from occurring, and aesthetic practices are important both for dental and dental health and for mood health, as well as for providing a nice smile, Berk said.
Unless there is a disorder or genetic factors in dental structures, young people's teeth are usually cramped.
Due to aging, drawing of dental minerals, and frequent consumption of cigarettes, vaccinations or sheer coloured beverages, the teeth take more sheer colour over the years.
Beware of things can be provided with fine porcelain floors, which are made like takeaway squirrels, applied with chemical substances applied by dentists, or without minimal or no vaccination on the surface of the teeth.
Femininity should never be crawled with products sold in the brand or on the internet.
Because, these substances line the Mine surface, the teeth collide so that they won't be recycled again.
Since 2011, the City of Keenan has been providing "Home Drive and mouth Health Service" to elderly, disabled and disadvantaged residents.
"I was aware of this service by my wife, the City of Keenan," said Koksal Gungur, 65, who has lived a 24-year-old bed-bound life in Keqiören's Revival Tower.
We called the municipality, they came instantly.
"I'm already paralysed from the paint, I don't neglect my dental care if it's not at all thanks to this service," he said.
"My mother has been addicted to bed for 7.5 years because of her age," said Kezban Gokçe, the 72-year-old daughter of Gülizar Taschioglu, a 95-year-old resident of the Pizarian neighbourhood.
When I arrived in the municipality, I saw posters of this service and immediately called it.
We've been getting this service on a regular basis for 4 years.
I also have a problem in my teeth, and when the doctors come, they look at me as well.
"We are very pleased," he added.
There is also no requirement for any health guarantees for the service, which is completely free.
"Severance" incident in Turkish military
My dear readers made very interesting decisions, especially for the Marine Corps, at the Supreme Military Council (YAS) meeting the previous day.
The commander of this Force was not an admiral, but a lieutenant colonel.
It is an almost unprecedented practice in our military.
How did that happen?
Force Commander Major General Bulent Bostanoglu has served his time, and would have already retired....
And it happened.
Now the commander-in-chief was the only admiral, Veysel Koksele.
Veysel Pasha, who has been a victim of castration in the past and has been detained for some time, was supposed to be commander in the regular severance ranking.
But the government didn't want him.
I try to explain in very essence that if we start from the top in the Marine Corps, commanders 1, 3, 4 and 5 have not been promoted.
In this case, he was the only admiral in the Marine Corps.
The vacant makeup had to be brought in: The Navy Commander in two numbers, Major General Veysel Koksele.
What happened afterwards?
Vice Admiral Adnan Ozbal, who is in sixth place, was appointed by the government at the time.
Now you look at the picture!
He stands there, but a lower-ranking commander is appointed to replace him!
A senior is placed under the order of your continent.
What will happen next?
An admiral who is superior to the prophet cannot, and cannot, serve under the command of a lieutenant general who is inferior to him.
He doesn't get orders from him, he can't get it.
In this case, Veysel Koksele will not face this incendiary situation, and if he is not retired, he will resign today or tomorrow.
This is the incendiary message that has already been given to him by the government: "Laugh Veysel Pasha!"
News spread yesterday that he was stepping down in the afternoon when I wrote this article, but the situation has not yet been officially announced.
Now let's re-look at these ones!
For one reason or another, the government opposed Veysel Koksele, unwilling, forced him to step down and replaced him with a 6th-ranked Vice Admiral, undermining the traditional "contingency" understanding of our military.
There is politics in the business, but we don't know the behind-the-scenes.
Maybe soon, if someone understands, we can all learn together!
My dear readers, above, tried to explain very briefly, especially in the Turkish military, which is very important.
It's not just as rank-and-file.
The officer, who finished 10th in the Military Academy, for example, is more likely to finish 11th.
Promoted to the rank of general from the first place, he is more than promoted to second place.
We have seen concrete examples of this contingency in the Resistance.
Garp Front commander Ismet Pasha...
There are two armies under his command.
The military and the World War II-era Army have been working together since the end of World War II
When we arrived in 1922, our armies would carry out the big assault and chase down the Greek army.
There are valuable names expected to be appointed army commander at this stage.
One is Refet (Bele) Pasha.
He is offered an army command, but he says, "Isis is inferior to me, I can't get under his command."
Another name is Jakup Shevki (Sufis) Pasha.
Ataturk's mentor at the War Academy...
He is a precious and senior commander who has been involved in various wars, which he likes, values, refers to as a "hoax."
In 1919, soldiers and civilians were captured along with Turkish intellectuals and driven by the British to the island of Malta.
When he returns home, he is reluctant to take command of the army and says the same thing: "The commander of the Western front is inferior to me, I cannot take orders from him."
Ataturk, however, is convinced that he is willing to do so, and Jakup Shevki Pasha agrees to be commander of one of our two armies.
The third is a very colourful name...
Ali Ihsan (Sabis) Pasha.
He's a very speaking, constantly criticizing soldier.
He is a commander who has fought in Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran and on various fronts.
He is being driven by Britons to Malta, then fleeing and arriving in Ankara via the island of Kusadasi.
Ali Ihsan Pasha says the same when he was offered an army commander. "I cannot fight under the command of Isis, which is without me."
But it's persuasive...
But see the bride, after her inauguration, she is constantly discussing with the commander of the Garp Front, Ismet Pasha, whom she commands, making an incident and making the military disgruntled...
And shortly before the big assault, he is sacked and retired, replaced by the injured Nurettin Pasha.
Afterwards, Ali Ihsan's relationship with Ataturk is never corrected.
The issue of contingency in the Turkish military is not only in war, but also in peace.
Of course, it has to come out.
Veysel Koksele is the latest example.
One activist had to learn the answer to the question, "What are the streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
A day after arriving for a trip to New York City, he sat in the bed of Airbnb, where he rented the location of St. Louis, and began touring on Facebook on his phone.
It coincided with the sharing of someone from high school.
"The police killed an 18-year-old boy a little bit ago and he's still in the street," she said.
He was surprised when he realized that no one else had shared that information in the flow of content, shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
One user, @ TheePharoah wear, was continually re-tweeting in her content flow.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was tweeting the death of Michael Brown live, an 18-year-old, unarmed black man was killed in Ferguson Missouri by a white police officer.
He shared a photo of Brown's serviced cat in the street, which will stay for 4 hours there.
"It's bruising," Ferrell thought of his own.
But death was nothing new for him or for his community.
He left his phone to return to tweets about the gathering of people on Canfield Drive later that evening.
There were police bangs, shouting people and photos of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, holding a banner that read, "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son a little earlier!"
A live broadcast showed a police officer standing with a shark flying in front of a group of protesters.
In another video, another policeman, as he said, set up the teeth of his rifle and shouted: "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembered saying, 'This isn't used to it.'
"'This is the kind of murder we're used to and it's not a murder that we can call typical,'" he said.
At that moment, I felt emphatic.
I was drunk and I was crying. "
He set aside a return ticket and went home the next day.
After landing at 11am, she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson with him the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years will come to cinemas on August 11th, the subject of a new documentary, "What are the streets?"
This is a story about survival and protest, love and loss, power and resistance from the point of view of people living in that community and filling the streets with the answers they are looking for.
While Ferrell was driving his vehicle to Ferguson with his daughter, who was dressed in a flower dress and wearing an appropriate tail, they went back to the conversation "about the experiences of black people and the situations of black people," which they had done several times earlier that morning.
"Remember I was teaching you that black people should fight for what they believe in?" He remembered.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't true," he said.
I wouldn't have been able to get him, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened here today... is a result of what happened in the past.
He should know it, see it and catch up in it.
Not only should we develop well in the field of activism and organised crime, but we should know the catchphrases of the black experience, and what we need to do to know and liberate ourselves.
I told her that if I was lucky enough to have an experience in which she would not experience nightmarish racism personally, there would be no difference from any black woman-child.
I have the feeling that by protecting him from the bungalow, I will be making him evil. "
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stop was on South Florissant Road, which turned into a kind of campsite for activists, where they waited to speak to the officer, Darren Wilson, about the issue, which later resulted in no crime.
There, Ferrell and his daughter linked up with local business owners who prepared packing food.
They prepared bags and helped bring them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, it was slowly shaping a new fountain of activism.
"My activism completely transformed after August 9th," he said, noting that he was a student at Missouri State University and was president of the Union of Minority Students' Hemorrhages and focused on food justice and injustice in the black community.
"I had no experience in organising.
It was spontaneous. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, at an evening screening.
Folayan said he and his own appearance director, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, "wanted to document" what was going on.
Ferrell had a question on his mind: "Do you want to document you or are you trying to find a story you can use?"
This skepticism was usually reported by countless struggling people, particularly whites; to come to a community and benefit from his pain and resilience...
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson couldn't intensify, and we decided to do it in a different way."
Folayan had already been linked to co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism on prisoners who received death sentences.
His participation warmed Ferrell to the project, followed by six other regional places, as well as the "streets Kim?" Team, in the years after Brown was shot.
David said: "This documentary is not about someone speaking for us or speaking to us; we are the ones who speak."
"That was the main thing for me, how these people would be represented because that's how I would be represented," he said.
"The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, but to show that the move" is not about a decent leader, it is about bringing society together, "he said, proving that film participants have the most deficit.
As a result, "The streets are Kim?" Surprisingly, as if she were in love and married to her carer, she belts out the personal aspects of Ferrell's life.
"I felt like a chiropractor," said Glen Ferrell, in his first opinion of the bite product.
"But while I was doing this job and insinuating black people, I didn't understand that there could be some sensitivity," he said.
In addition, Ferrell's story solidifies and removes the role of black gay women in the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders, who derided the # BlackLivesMatter slogan on social media after the 2012 murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin, describe themselves as gay.
"In general, black gay women in leadership have kept the movement alive," Ferrell said. "And this is because we are continually at war on many fronts.
Black gay women have to carry all the weight of it, "she said.
Folayan agreed, saying: "The movement is really being held up by black women and a lot of gay black women."
Nonetheless, Ferrell insists that "this is not something in the fountain of negative action" and that he was not chosen because of his identity.
He says: "He was the one who moved that energy."
"But it is not unusual for her to be at the forefront, because as a black gay woman you have a lot to lose by living a life in these intersections.
You can feel the energy of it from the screen. ""
In Ferguson, meanwhile, news cameras have already gone, but alarming racial links remain between the community and the police.
Ferrell is under surveillance for another 2.5 years for closing the highway during a demonstration.
My house describes the socio-political atmosphere in the region as a one-word "tangle."
Still, he meets the song he endured in his memory exactly three years ago, when he took to the streets of Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose other than our sins. "
Kyrie Irving: The world is flat, not round!
"The world is not round," Irving told NBC Sports.
The world is flat.
They get used to things like this by giving people fear.
Oh my friend, a lot of questioning.
Because, no matter how much information you solve, one more information comes out.
It's madness.
Is the world flat?
Or does it revolve around itself in a round-the-clock way?
I think you should investigate this issue.
I tell you, they lie against our face.
They lie to us! "He added.
"I believed I wanted to believe over the years," Irving said.
And I thought the world was going round and turning.
Do you really think we're returning within the solar system?
Nothing they send doesn't come back.
He's not going back!
The information they give us is very inconsistent.
The truth is here.
You just have to look for that fact.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?" He said.
Kyrie Irving, who claims the world is flat, is averaging 24.4 points and 5.9 assists for the Cleveland Cavaliers this season.
Mask a similarity: Artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create Portraits
In the middle of the room at the New York Fridman Gallery is white, black and brown, sliced through the cabinets in the ceiling, and there are a lot of faces, each similar to almost certain uncertain ones.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, with listening chips and cut-out hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning, a former intelligence analyst who served a 35-year sentence after leaking classified diplomatic messages, as he is known, through the WikiLeaks website, sent his cut-off hair out of Fort Leavenworth prison.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is named after a Persian similarity.
This is the product of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her discipline with her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans-woman and leading dissident whose sentence was pardoned by Barack Obama three days before the end of her term.
Dewey-Hagborg, who created 30 portraits by analyzing DNA algorithmic extracts from Manning and using what a person with this gen dataset might look like, has revealed not only the perpetuity of DNA dataset (there are many ways to be interpreted), but also its identity in a tight, perhaps slightly bewildered interpretation.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but clearly identified himself as a woman in more error, was convicted of 20 offences in 2013, including six from the spying Act, computer forgery and theft.
His majesty was put under pressure by the prison, so there was only one photograph of him: A sandy, black white self-portrait of Manning, visibly tearful, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a plain-heeled persona emblazoned with him.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had success with the huge sound of her 2012 project, More Garden Preventions.
In it, he produced Portraits that scan DNA from the bones of criminal pieces, such as cigarette butts and stains, to paint a picture of what these people might look like.
At exactly that time, he received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were doing an interview while in prison with Chelsea Manning and they wanted some sort of portrait that could be accompanied by this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained, in a press preview of the new exhibition.
At that time, he was not invited to visit, and his photograph was not taken, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if he had an interest in making a DNA portrait.
He and his hapless aunt became expectant letter friends during the two-year period, toasting a lot of letters.
They even discovered a caricature book, The Bastard Emmys, which was illustration by Shoili Code, in which the president pardoned Chelsea's sentence and imagined a future in which he could see the exhibition as personal.
Obama indeed asked for Manning's release a few days after the book was released, a sort of happy coincidence that came well after seven ruthless years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump has found new, tweeted ways to further fuel the sharp divisions that have been asked to wage war on those leaking information about the government and the transgender troops and tweeting himself, there is also something deep and powerful about this exhibition that is now being opened.
When asked about the weird timing of all this, Dewey-Hagborg said, "Our actions happen for a reason."
A handwritten artist's beard on the gallery's wall, which Manning's signature on the cobbled dimensions, is below it (the point of the phrase "i" was put with heart), was calling for an end to "automatic discrimination" based on "gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the face of the wall is his mitochondrial DNA secrecy: A lot of C's, G's and A's written with lead items...
Dewey Hagborg, by incorporating 200 letters (or nucleus, according to the artist's softly inspired lyrics), wanted to tell us how stunning we all are, at least as a biological casualty, to each other.
"What I hope people will learn from this is that our genomics don't care about who we are and how open the genetic dose is to exhaustion, how subsidised it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video job is showcasing takeaway moments.
"DNA data can tell a lot of different stories, and that's 30 of those stories," he said.
The last piece in the series, held in a single room, is a page from the short-line novel that has previously been promised.
Here, Manning, King Kong-style, is shown while out in a hopeless ensemble from the Disciplinary barracks of the United States of America.
"They have silenced your speech or they have won," he writes.
"So it's never susceptible," he said.
"It came direct from a letter he wrote to me," said the artist, who is from Philadelphia.
"When I'm still talking about it, my tummy is dipping," he said.
Manning has yet to see the exhibition personally (as if it had fallen quite unforeseen from his caricature book), but when he sees it, he will be greeted with masks with his own genetic tactics, gathered like a group of protesters in the middle of the room.
Like everything else in the Sergio, genetic haploads are up to the paint of Manning, written with lead items (5 "2, Manning's lifetime), which was particularly done.
"In the past, I've put them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted this to be perceived as a collective movement shaped by Chelsea, which is also like the movement behind his liberation," he said.
Northwestern education officer and Oxford University employee Arrested for murder
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a Northwestern University education officer and Oxford University employee who is wanted as a suspect after he was found stabbed to death by a man on a luxury apartment floor in Sheikago, police said.
Cook administration area records show that on Monday, arrest museums were issued for first-degree murder without bail for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Cornell-Duranleau (26) died after being stabbed several times, documents say.
A warning issued by the Sikago Police Department was told a body was found on July 27.
Officers received a phone call, reached Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with many deep cuts to her body.
Official sources said it was announced that Cornell-Duranleau had died at the scene and that detectives were investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police were actively searching for the two suspects.
Lathem has been a doorman since 2007 at Northwestern University in microbiology and immunology.
In an email, Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said Lathem was on administrative leave and was barred from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case that is under investigation by the necessary authorities, and the Northwestern University is co-operating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
"We are in contact with the United Kingdom police and are ready to assist the US investigative authority in any way they need," a spokesman for the university and the University of Somerville said in an email.
Beforehand, Warren's colleagues were told they were in shock and wanted him to turn himself in.
Communications Chief Anthony Guglielmi of the Sikago Police Department said he strongly encouraged suspects to surrender to the authority.
"The police have an idea where they are, but our efforts to identify them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who had just received a mysterious clue that something had happened in the 1008 apartment.
Police described the scene as very horrific.
Guglielmi said it was not clear whether the incident was also on July 27.
He said Lathem and Warren were in the building and were confirmed by security cameras.
"We believe it was the victim's relationship with Professor Latham," Guglielmi said.
The management staff at Grand Plaza issued a statement saying to residents: "Police are still working on the victim's timeline and past and are investigating a number of saints, including a probable domestic incident."
Italy seizes German ship
Italian police said the ship, Iuventa, which was involved in the search and rescue of asylum seekers in the Central Mediterranean, was seized on Lampedusa Island yesterday.
Police also shared records of phone conversations they said belonged to two members of the group, and announced that the operation was part of an investigation launched by the Trapani Prosecutor's Office in October 2016.
Jugend Rettet members, who allegedly "also operated in favour of illegal migration along the Libya-Italy line," allegedly brought asylum seekers from the boats of Libyan human traffickers to Italy at least 3 times.
There are also allegations that members of Jugend Rettet, questioned by the prosecutor's office, committed the crime along with a number of people from the Libyan Coast Guard.
The organisation then said in a statement that its priorities would continue to be to save human lives, adding that it was considering the charges brought against them.
In addition to ships under the Italian Coast Guard and the European Union (EU) mission, about 9 international NGOs are also involved in the search and rescue of asylum seekers in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government has drafted a 13-point code of conduct for their compliance, requiring it to be signed.
The latest: 5 bumps of Banks attacked by Metropolitan Police sealed
Essendon Metropolitan Mayor Yilmaz was detained by police after the attack, and five bust-ups rented from the TCDD by retired police Mahfuz Banli, who was arrested by the court where they were issued, were sealed off by the City of Tepebasi.
According to Haberturk, the city teams were accompanied by a large number of police and Environmental Force teams.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "In the short term, we will complete the WADA roadmap."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take a long time to implement the remaining World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the Russian Anti-doping Agency (RUSADA) to become reworking.
"A specific phase in meeting the road map criteria has been completed, and RUSADA has obtained the right to plan and test in co-operation with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-doping).
The WADA road map has been updated in this context, "Mutko said on Thursday.
He was assessing the second part of the WADA Directive compliance Road Map, which was recently published on the institution's website, scanning the criteria governing the reworking of RUSADA.
According to Mutko, this does not include anything that would worry Russia.
"Everything has been announced, all will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future, "he added.
But one criterion mentioned on the list is that Russian anti-doping officials have to publicly accept the reported results of the state-sponsored doping investigation, which was approved by WADA and claimed in Russian sport by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.
"Our anti-doping system acknowledges a failure, while we are conducting the investigation.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no state programme and we will not accept something that has not existed. "
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Commission on Public Anti-doping.
Speaking to Russian broadcaster RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov acknowledged past problems with Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said at many opportunities that the report contains positions and regulations that are anti-Semitic.
No one is considering accepting the report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended by WADA for conducting doping checks in Russia at the height of the doping scandal in November 2005.
But this June test planning and coordination was allowed under the supervision of international experts and the United Kingdom Anti-doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the institution's headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to become refunctional.
It was followed by 100 million people!
The video, titled "Come to Besiktas," in which Besiktas announced the Negredo transfer, quickly reached 100 million people from 18 countries.
The video, adorned with dialogue by Quaresma, Pepe and Negredo, was also shared from the websites of major newspapers such as Marca, L'Equipe, La Gazzetta dello Sport.
Galatasaray president does not return empty-handed
Faruk Süren, the former president of Galatasaray, has sharply criticised chairman Dursun Ozbek, who travelled to Bucharest and the capital Ankara for the Ndiaye transfer to convince Mircea Lucescu.
Here are the mythical speaker's special statements for morning readers:
Lucescu-Ozbek talks: "We were finished when we went."
The president of Galatasaray does not go into a vacuum, and he does not return empty-handed.
Ndiaye transfer: The president of Galatasaray does not go to the footballer.
The footballer comes to the President's leg.
Of course, they meet, whether it's kissing their hand or embracing...
But no matter who the player is, the president doesn't go to his leg.
You were giving 9 m euros to the player that the Ottomans received for 300,000 euros...
He's going to be 9 million with bonuses, not 7.5 million!
If you've already invested big, of course, you're going to play and it's going to be 7.5....
His inventions: I don't want to be Tenkins.
But the waiver is obvious.
G.House values are eroding.
The approach to all of them, not just football, is wrong.
It is the Division Council and the General Assembly that will change that.
But as far as I understand, members are pleased!
Start-up to help your company not be the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at the e-commerce start-up, but the polls didn't work.
The answers were generally unclear, unhelpful or, worse, deceptive.
Some employees did not trust the process, even though they pledged to do so.
"There has never been consistency or nesting," says Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce company on hair care in San Fransisko.
He called someone from the outside for help.
A new kind of human resources start-up is emerging to make companies understand how their employees feel.
These include producing and licensing a software whose specialized purpose is to gauge employees' obituaries, enabling firms to conduct clandestine choice surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anomalies and complaints assistance lines, and, in some cases, allow employees who have been able to hire senior managers and make an announcement of an impartiality to the direct board.
"There are now tools that monitor your health, such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is your company's Fitbit?" Said Jim Barnett, founding partner and president of Glint, a Redwood City start-up whose software analysis tools measure the prevalence of employees by companies.
Using Glint, Errett says his employees better understand what he thinks and feels after three years.
In addition to offering spacious teams a glimpse of what parts of the company have received the most complaints, and which directors have low disliking scores, it offers a warning map, so that their causes can be dwarfed.
In order not to be the next Uber, companies are starting to understand that they need to have information about the culture of their workplace; Uber has been in a scandal since tarnishing an environment of harassment in which those who publicly say what they think in a blog post by a former employee are punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for surveillance means a very profitable business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020, according to financial technology drinks website Let's talk Payments.
Interest in Denver Colorado-based start-up Convercent, which helps companies identify and prevent bad behavior, and the event increased earlier this year amid controversy over Uber's reputation.
Convercent has close to 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Convercent, like Glint, allows companies to make personalized "nose" surveys, collect real-time confidential responses and remove heat maps of problem areas.
It also offers a fundraising line that can send an angle message that employees can know about bad behavior.
If the chairman is charged, the complaints go straight to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and chairman of Covercent, said: "The Cameroon court has handled regulators."
Quinlan said: "If a company is abusive or unethical to its employees, it could face costly consequences due to consumer boycotts, employee weaknesses or lawsuits, even if regulators are not involved.
Restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday, which has more than 25,000 employees in 500 positions, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure its employees are aware of the principles and procedures and can easily reach the company's headquarters.
Previously, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or email belonging to the company headquarters, had a formal complaint and hoped it would be taken seriously.
James Vitrano, chief legal partner at Ruby Tuesday, said these were often eye-catching and disturbing experiences, with no good way to follow employee complaints.
But now that the company is using Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden from executives sitting in office, city or county away (such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practice) can be identified and solved more quickly.
Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management group, said: "I can get even closer to this employment experience with a whole, 360-degree perspective."
"Also, we protect our shareholders against business cases."
In 2002, after accounting firm Arthur Andersen was battered by a breach of ethical values stemming from the Enron scandal, companies dealt with ethics, values and the relationship with the employee more seriously in 2002, "Quinlan said.
But after "social media came to its own," the firms realised they could not prevent their dirty washing from going viral.
"Before technology was used to oversee the label, people were using hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and receive recurring fees for the use of their products.
This is a business model and opportunity with the approval of risk capital investors who support both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 m in financing for the branch from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital to $47 m.
Glint provided $10 million in coffers from Bessemer Venture Partners and increased its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are not a surprise, given the nature, culture and risk capital of companies that depend on each other.
Increasing amounts of research show that today's employees expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just minimum requirements.
Employees want to feel they are accepted, valued and given their time to a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint, said: "When people are happy to be in a company, when they feel their voices are heard and the work they do is sweet, they are more content to make that company successful."
Investors will profit when their own portfolio companies are doing a good job; companies will do a good job if they feel they belong to the company rather than to their employees.
If third-party analysis tools are meant to improve employees' instinct and sense of belonging, it is not surprising that they find support.
Having data on employee commitment is important according to workplace culture experts.
But the data doesn't work if those responsible for the company don't act.
In fact, a company can create an expectation that change is coming if it wants feedback from its employees.
And if the expectation doesn't come fast enough, or if it doesn't come at all, it can be disappointing and make employees feel like they have been copied.
"If you're going to ask for 4000 proposals, you need to be ready to speak 4000," said Russell Raath, who is a counselor at business management firm Kotter International and has seen firms make the mistake of relying too much on data gathering.
"Because if you don't follow it, employees will think, 'Do you really commute me?
Does he care?
And if you don't care about your skin, why don't I care? '
Madison Reed, who conducted monthly employee surveys, was able to act on the same day when a problem was reported in Glint, according to Errett.
And after collecting feedback from employees who were overwhelmed by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise various teams within the company and added communication training to address the problems.
On Ruby Tuesday, the company is taking new insights into its own employees and hopes that in the long run this will translate into being able to keep more workers in such an industry known to be a high number of employee introductions.
"If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you lose people," Vitrona said.
"And if you lose people," he said, "you're going to lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose firms, "he said.
It means a long day for the Bruins as the NCAA lifts two training sessions every day.
It comes at 11 a.m. and a group of UCLA football players hang out to chat on one edge of the team's new training ground inside the campus.
Some have smashed the superiors of their stripes, revealing their terribly concerned backs, which are the rarest of the first day in training camp.
For a significant part of the team, these empty minutes are a mid-day break.
After a 3-hour training session, players registered for summer classes will return home and work their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Centre for meetings at 6.30am the following morning.
"The next three days are an eagle for these guys," Bruins coordinator Jim Mora said just before returning to the salon on Sunday.
Held to lift the burden on the players, the NCAA lifted two training sessions a day, at least until the finals ended on Friday, actually extended their days.
So UCLA's first three training sessions were programmed to start at 7.15pm to adapt to the players' already tight schedule.
The lack of two training sessions a day is mainly a training session a day; the Bruins take the start of camp close to a week from last season and train at summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons at Westwood during summer school.
They plan to have 18 training sessions by August 20 before starting formal game preparations for their opening against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said the NCAA supports the rule change, even though it has added new items to the players' intensive work program.
Mora said: "We're putting a huge burden on them for three or four days and that's very challenging."
"And they went through it anytime soon; they're working, they're amazing kids," he said.
I think when we come to the quartet, we're going to have more time, it's going to be really amazing.'
UCLA will stop their training when the camp is over; the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which has a football ball rain on the side and the finish, and closes the fortress with a protective network, is no easy task, given that its pitches stretch across the line of view.
Bruins players are scheduled to relocate to the hotel from the start of this week, but Mora admits there could be a problem with the vacancy of those rooms during the season.
"We're going to have security," Mora said.
"It's a real concern and it's not too flying to think that someone will rent a room and sit there and videotape a training session," he said.
If a coach has a video recording, that's good for the bye.
But we will have security there and we will have security at the parking place 8 above.
We will do our best with what we have.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
We have a plan. "
Facebook boosts the power to verify story to fight fake news
Facebook will send more potential fake articles to third-party story versions and show their findings under the original sharing; the world's largest online social network on Thursday described how it tried to fight what it called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the firm said it would use updated machine learning to identify possible fraud and send them to story versions, which would potentially show the story verification results below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the main distribution points for news billed as fake news, which many think affected the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also turned into a major political headache in Europe, with French voters suffering a flood of fake news before the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to cut penalties if they fail to speed up hateful sharing to social media networks in the run-up to the crisp election there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new story verification feature is being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Sara Su, Facebook news flow product manager, wrote in a blog: "In addition to seeing what stories are being discussed by third-party story versions, people are asking for more resources about what they read and share to make decisions based on information."
He added that Facebook would continue to test the "relevant article" and would work on other changes to the news flow to reduce fake news.
Creating a cartoon: The story of a Kale in the UK
In his recent past, the Manufacturing Scotney Fortress featured in a Squeeze music clip and was a refuge in the 1970s and 1980s for Margaret Thatcher.
But right now, Scotney, who inspires a line of Romans written by Jamie Rhodes of Yorkshire who is passionate about decorative hair, historical documents, has mastered a turbulent 700-year history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent.
"I find it very nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," she said, with a shrug.
"How it's a personal bond is to keep this letter in my hand," he said.
A Fortress in Britain, from the Edward takeover to the Middle Ages, each story belts out families who lived in Scotney to be portrayed by a different artist named after the United Kingdom (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg).
This is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: He also wrote 2014's Death men's femininity and Other Stories, a project he found unexpectedly emotional, inspired by stories at the British Library.
"Even with my fingerprints on the side of a letter written in the 1700s by a bilateral agent working for King James fans, my eyes were full," he says.
"This was a follow-up to his top finger!
The letters always smell like that because at the time you would burn a fire for light.
For someone in the future of 300 years, this smell feels like he's in it too.
Ah, I'm obsessed with the archives! "
It seems too good to get support from the National Trust and the Arts Council of England as someone in love with old papers, and to stay for almost four months in a fortress ("honestly, I've overcome bizarre by staying out of the need not to be warmly welcomed").
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Viktorian-era "new" fortress, scanning archives and working on a number of treasures and antiques, such as back-to-back cafes assembled on the walls of the property, and bottles that had spent centuries in the ditches.
He travelled around the land and ruins of the old fortress, talking to the guardians, the predators and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustration of his book.
Then, at night, "the visitor would drink and put on writing."
As the National Trust can access full access only when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006, it is unconscionable to see Scotney's deserted history.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the staff only began to take over the archive, which he scanned: "Centuries of aristocrats were saying: 'Oh, take it out of the ceiling'."
Diaries, letters from the days of the British empire, maps that set the limits of who owned it: "You would think the territorial disputes would be boring," Rhodes said, "but there was a hush tree that the two families were fighting over.
Thank you, guys! "
Some stories in the collection, including The Labourer, which left the newly built stronghold to join the Village Inn in 1381, use the fortress as a springboard for a wider introduction to British history.
"There is a record in this book, The Childhood Families of the city and Sussex, that there was a rebellion at 1380 in the stronghold," Rhodes says.
"The Village Identity started around this, and I thought that a rebellion could be a good starting point.
Maybe these two could be linked? "
Other stories are heavily linked to the history of the fortress, for instance The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family, who spent 7 years hiding a Cizvit pond during British Islamism.
Or The Smuggler, featuring the 18th-century smuggler Arthut Darrell, who is thought to have filled a coffin with stones and staged his own funeral (an execution made years later when his coffin was removed from the land).
Darrell's Rhodes' most eye-catching Scotney family: "These masterminds looked like ladies disorder, they were always boring and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt crises by marrying rich older women; I imagine them as a group of decent men who are hugely inclined to rate female heirs, "she said.
Rhodes, who has finished his job at the Fortress, is looking for other tailor-writing experiences.
In Finnish wild life, he completed a two-week job for a cartoon about Elämänmäki, the site of an art orchestra in the early 20th century, which has since been revisited by nature.
But Scotney keeps a separate place in her hearts.
"I was sorry I was disgusted," she said.
"It was like: 'Ah, now I have to go and face the possible real life of the lane.'
'Maho 'reaction to Meral festivities
The secretary-general of the Nationalist Movement Party, Ismet Buyukataman, issued a written statement in recent days regarding the MHP-related social media and media allegations of his resignation.
He used social media and "corners of some ex-rifle Marxists" to describe the MHP as "crazy," adding that "plays and stands have been put in place to prevent the nationalist movement from continuing to exist under the MHP after September 12th."
The grandfather said: "I'm not sure what's going to happen.
"No matter the historical existence of the Turkish nation, no matter how sickening the Turkish people are, the criminal dossier is a nightmare, the idea is bullying, the mentality is mixed, it raises its hands," he said.
"Now they have come out." 410 people from the leadership and members of the MHP Kocaeli Gucci County Service and 215 people from the MHP Bursa district of Yenisehir have resigned. "
The public is misled by unsubstantiated messaging reports such as 250 resignations, 300 resignations.
In newspaper columns, lies have been devised, albeit deepening.
The number of patrons in the aforementioned places does not exceed one's fingers, as there is no resignation that has reached this number of hands.
He described the resignations as "so-called," adding that the polls, which he again called "so-called," sought to mislead the public and establish perception management.
"Their propaganda and campaigns aimed at creating perceptions against the MHP will be counterproductive," he said.
The MHP is an important and indispensable factor in Turkish politics, MHP Secretary General Buyukan said of the resignations.
The power of the former Marxists is not enough, as the MHP has used a sword to destroy the place it acquired in the conscience of the Turkish nation.
A dirty account lies behind all the comments that have been made, the perception management metaphors that have been implemented.
Because politics and the media have set their sights on the MHP base.
It makes no sense for those who do not work and strive in favour of our party when we are among us, to resign now.
What is it that those who failed to extricate the Nefiss account from our party have resigned?
He has never touched the MHP in his lifetime, he has not shared our memories, he has not understood our country, he has not joined our fight, he has always stood on the edge even if he joins, his mind has been enslaved, his heart submerged, and he should find another oasis for them.
Those who fail to pull out the unity and integrity of the Nationalist Movement Party are seeking to extract fitness, debate and service are an effort in the brain.
And he's going to go back to the terrace and hit the owner.
The Nationalist Movement is the last remaining stronghold of the Turkish nation, despite heavy destruction.
For those who say they are targeting the MHP, "political counterfeiters," "political capitalists," he said in a statement. "The nationalist movement is not without ownership."
"The outside mouths in the corner content that feed across the ocean will not be able to achieve their purpose, regardless of the price," he said.
"The Tasmanian hawks will go back and burn in the blaze," the MHP's Buyukan said in a statement, listing opposition parties and terrorist organisations together. "Whatever they do, from the CHP to the HDP, and then to the Perinians, from the PKK to the FETO, they will not be able to launch an operation on the Turkish nation's right to have their own destiny."
Yesterday, without Turkes, we were inspired by the new tactics and plays of those who planned Turkey without the MHP; we fought until the end with those who wanted a government without MHP, a parliament without MHP.
And now we're going to disrupt the games, we're going to persevere the players.
"The pattern of the country is in the MHP," he said, implying Meral Akdiker. "Like the Banker Bilo movie, a former Greens production, I will take the Maho villagers to Germany," he said. "After several days of travelling in a truck cage, how did they leave Istanbul on a mountain slope, the exterior of the zoo they go after, I take you to power and leave you on the edge of the gap."
This is their matter, but our only desire from these patrons is for them to be the newcomer to where they go.
Kjaer has signed for Sevilla
Kjaer, who moved to Sevilla for £12.5 m from the spurs squad and made history as the most expensive defensive transfer for the Spanish team, has signed an official contract.
The Danish star will wear the number 4 jersey at Sevilla.
Great inconvenience for Beguiled families from THY
The national airline, which highlights the flight comfort and satisfaction of its passengers and works to make them feel more comfortable during the flight, continues to develop new ideas for an excellent travel experience, according to the THY Press Association.
To that end, the so-called "baby travel kitchen," designed to address the needs of babies and their families between the ages of 0 and 2, is being offered to infant travellers travelling on intercontinental flights starting in August.
The kit, prepared with a specially designed bag, includes a subtle alternate duck, one-use Mama forehead, reptile cream, beef loser and champagne, newborn-eating pineapple menu and breast peel.
The products, which do not contain harmful chemicals with Paraben, Alcohol, painkillers, were produced in keeping with the sensitivity of the baby cat.
Washington Changes Green Card Rules
The media quoted President Donald Trump as saying there would be a new US immigrant plan making changes to the Green Card rules.
It envisions reducing legal immigration to 50,000 units a year, stricter rules for temporary work permits and restrictions on visas for family.
The new rules were offered by Republicans and backed by the president.
The draft legislation will be debated in both chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce the poor, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and it will do so by changing the way the United States gives Green Card to citizens of other countries.
The law would reduce chain migration and replace the current regime.
This new application process will benefit English-speaking candidates, those with self-sufficient financial resources and talent that will benefit our economy, "American media quoted Trump as saying.
Writers comment on Fenerbahce-Sturm Graz match
She was getting back to the euphoria and eyebrows that I hadn't found for two seasons, that I couldn't see...
A "mangled heart-wrenching" team, issued in absence by Aykut, were on the field to make the "Stop on our back" deal with their fans.
We can bring criticism to his game, positions or performances, but I haven't watched such a functioning and looking game for a long time.
He was certain in the first game, but yesterday his apocalypse was on his own takeaway shoulder; Fenerbahce's commander in the field is now Valbuena.
When he was transferred, his age was a problem, but in my husband's words he had the sentence "the character who didn't give up."
30 years ago, we gave the name right to the atomic carcinogenic to the Riza.
If he does deal with it, it will be the most burdensome comment to the Frenchman.
He was all over the field, joining all the pass organizers and always taking responsibility and scoring a goal, bursting a huge show into the short paint.
Alper's play in the lead, staying in the second striker's position, has left the Sturm Graz team "limited" on the field for a long time.
Fenerbahce has repeatedly sought a formula to overcome such a tough wall while closing in on the winner without a bunker.
They dominate the ball, but they can't produce effective passes in any competing penalty area.
That appearance could make the comment "striker needs to," but we are facing the game that hesitates to throw a pass at Ahmethan, unable to put the only striker in his hands into position.
Either the team didn't trust the young player or his performance needs to develop a little bit.
After the Skies were 1-1, they couldn't take advantage of two clear opportunities.
It was important for them to get through the round, but it would have made the night even more bewildering to shame this fan, who gave a standing ovation to the players' struggle, for a "goal."
There will probably be another 1-2 new transfers up to the Market.
But the reality is that Fenerbahce's biggest need is number 12...
We are on the brink of a very glamorous and enjoyable season with this style of play that carries the heart of those in the stands trying to play the lead.
He builds his machine ground, he needs a little bit more time.
They're good at physics quality.
The quality of play will also improve.
You also see very clearly that the self-confidence of all of the players on the field has increased.
They need a lot of glowing applause yesterday for a new page.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be concerned
It comes as a new report on technological advances in the sex robots industry is coming out while you think full-time 2017 can't be even more strange.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big event right now.
Recently, the State Robot Science Authority (FRR) published a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a retired professor of robot science and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we should take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, breast-feeding shape and type of squirrel.
Mr Sharkey said of the release of the new report: "People are laughing at them, but the firms are actually quite lovely and we'll see them even more."
Modern sex babies evolved into robots with particularly human-like reactions carried out by artificial intelligence, with silicone compound that is hot to touch from their infrared similarities.
Users are also able to personalize their robots to fit into their own blood by choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, breast-feeding shape and squirrel type or colour.
But with so many robots having "personalities" to make a Stepford Women innovative, this is even more disturbing.
Modern sex babies evolved into silicone-derived robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to personalize their own robots based on the character characteristics they find attractive (for instance, the shrewd).
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frijit Farrah," which gives the impression of abstinence, and "wildly Wendy," with its "adventurous" personality.
True Companion's website is euphoric: "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as much as possible."
So if you like it, he loves it, he doesn't like it if you don't like it, etc.
They also have rugby halls in the day, like the same real people.
It can be improbable, it can be willing to speak, or it can be "in full fashion."
There are a lot of disturbing sides to the rise of sex robots: Not only is it replacing real humanitarian relationships, but its over-obedient female-person characteristics are the most thinly veiled of rapturous connotations as you approach Frijit Farah.
On its website, True Companion likens Roxxxy to a vibrator, but it's the one for men.
"If it can be a vibrator of the woman (which is the same in the text), why not the Roxxxy of men?" The website states.
But these sex robots are not just a feud or sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex through boredom, an optional addition.
Many men will not naturally possess sex robots, and although the FRR has noted their growing popularity, for now they are on the outskirts of consumer culture.
But leaks from flying can be highly instructive about the trajectory of the period we live in.
Many people are not strange or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be so.
With a president in the White House who boasts of sexually assaulting women, it's little coincidence that these softly sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are under threat worldwide.
The most tumultuous side of The Handmaid's Tale TV series is not the depictions, hysterical bodies or oyster eyes that show all the details, but how realistic the look feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but at the moment it doesn't feel like it's been such a big change.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as much physical similarities as they can to real women (of course, in the rates of porn film stars) as technologically possible.
Their creators want them to give them a sense of human beings when they touch, and for them to imitate the movements of a real body.
But when business comes to their "personalities," robots clearly can't represent real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
They have no activities or past stories, nothing to expose their independence or disrupt Total slavery fantasy.
In other words, they are slaves who enjoy it.
Or the tag of 2017: Carrots.
Attack on American military convoy: Celebrities and wounded...
A suicide bombing in Karabakh, Afghanistan, targeted foreign military forces operating in the country.
The blast, which killed 1 NATO soldier and 3 civilians, also left the wounded, with 5 of the wounded as US soldiers in the convoy and 1 as interpreters working with NATO forces.
In an official statement, NATO support forces in Afghanistan (Resolute Support) said NATO forces detonated the suicide bomber's homemade explosive device during a joint patrol with the Afghan National Army.
The injured personnel are being treated at Bagram Airport's American Military Hospital, it has been announced.
There is no vital danger of the injuries.
Local media say the suicide bomber was a member of the Taliban.
What is Trump's great magic?
Showing Mitt Romney like a righteous timber
It was the reality of the Trump era that the political divide that polarized US voters divided families on a micro-scale.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day, newspapers in the United States were full of how to deal with the nightmare of relatives who voted for Trump.
We all make an effort to patch our own filtering balloons into the dictionary.
Less talked about is Trump's power to bring families together.
I address this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Sikago and is bitten by the Republicans in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
He reminded me that uniting against a common enemy could have a strong impact.
Anyone he knows, including his Republican brother, who has been exclusive for decades about policy with Trump's creation in the White House, is on the same side in multiple and strange ways.
At the dinner table, of course, this is a good thing, but it seems to me that in a broad context it carries significant risks.
The left was revived by Trump, but the blunt effect of his presidency created the power to be pushed to the left for all of me.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, one day we talk about the horrific possibility that his weird behavior may no longer be a joke.
There is even a more horrific long-term scenario, in the tenth, that Trump is "normalizing" right-wing Republicans who oppose his own standards, and they seem to be a symbol of multiple logic.
I find myself having nostalgia about the awkward version of Mitt Romney's madness: The dog in the ceiling of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like), both of which, according to Trump, are really very light crimes.
When Trump is gone, the next Republican nominee needs to be at the top of the aisle only to be assessed that he is providing measurable degree of development.
When my cousin was in the city, we took our children to the laundry in Central Park, the largest of the ancestors run by the New York parks department, and the three best ponies you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglas designs in the central silk (all of which make strange surfaces, palaces and animals return to look with fear at the back of their own shoulders), and the music of the sounds is awkwardly euphoric.
In other words, many clichés of a city can be disappointing: The landscapes of high buildings are starting to become tighter, the horizon line is becoming so familiar that it can't create much excitement, and the reality of the city is not reaching its bottom.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I still haven't completely overcome the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage is not actually a Swiss chef's house, but a vast returning hub in North London (the template bar ye Olde Swiss Cottage count).
But it's still a strange kind of magical experience when it comes to the attic at Central Park, so two people at the age of two, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go here and all have a very good time.
If I could give him a rating on his ankle, I would have given him a full rating, but no one was asking too much.
On the other hand, I was asked to evaluate my transaction "experience" between 1 and 5 stars before passing my credit card at a bonanza this week.
The same thing in the coffee shop in the corner of my street is the option of matching a note with a 15% excuse; for what's bought from the counter...
The effect is not only that it slows down what is supposed to be a neutral shopping, but also that it puts pressure on the server to give a person to an event that is never needed.
While the cleavage-defying woman in Bonmarine sounded like a standing apology, I, in frustration, gave five stars to my experience of giving her a credit card.
They wore mayhem as the temperature exceeded 41 degrees
People flocked to Munzur beaches in Tunceli, the site of one of the hottest days in the country.
Starting at noon, as temperatures pressed well, young, children, elderly, women and men entered the beaches on the side of the Munzur Age, trying to protect themselves from the heat by soaking up in ice-soaked waters.
Beaches along the banks of the Munzur Age have been flooded, especially since residents of sparsely populated countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom spend their holidays at home, rather than in the Aegean or Mediterranean.
Suna Tosun, one of the servicemen on Munzur beach, said that instead of the western provinces for the holiday, she used her preference for Tunceli. "I didn't want to spend my vacation in the west, but it was more true to stay on our own land," she said.
"Munzur's ice-like water doesn't exist anywhere in the world, in these temperatures Munzur is servicing us," he said.
Hasan Ulu, from Germany, said he preferred the coast of the Munzur Age in Tunceli instead of the Caliphate or Bodrum fields, so he did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with breast cancer
This is the second time Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to hospital for treatment for cuts to his billing, which prison officials said happened after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors to the previous accidental kidnapping decision.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he killed Steenkamp at his home in Pretoria by firing several times towards the door of a toilet cabin.
Pistorius had claimed he had confused his girlfriend with someone who had been uninvited to enter the nighttime hiding in his cabin.
Prosecutors said they intend to appeal again against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they thought was too light this time.
The National Cowboys body has said it will appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal could be assessed later this year.
Pistorius will face an increase in his sentence to 15 years if prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
First pilgrimage confectionery swamped
The prospective candidates, who will travel to Saudi Arabia with the organizing of the Religious Affairs Chair, were greeted with prayers and tears at Ataturk Airport's Foreign Houses departure terminal.
About 200 prospective candidates, as well as relatives and members of the public, attended the ceremony at the Foreign Housing terminal ahead of the first pilgrimage site's move.
Turkish Airlines (THY), on the other hand, delivered a rose in fuel to prospective candidates for the holy land on a scheduled plane.
The pilgrimage site in Ankara was sprawled out of Esanboga.
The café included relatives of martyrs and veterans who took advantage of this year's practice of "unfounded pilgrims for veterans and martyrs," which was first implemented this year.
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Illegal Building
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece on charges of illegal camping, according to a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and quoted by bTV.
A group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by police on the morning of August 1st in Sithonia.
They were left on the same day as the investigation was already underway.
The foreign affairs ministry told bTV that Bulgarians were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened their control over free camping and are imposing severe penalties on those caught while they are still housed in places that have not been set aside for that purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the seasons.
The ministry said the court could be penalised.
We won't return to the Netherlands without finding him
Joey Hoffman (22) travelled to Turkey to tour with his two friends in early July.
Joey Hoffman, who toured Adana and Mersin with the vehicle they rented, went missing in Silifke on 8 July.
Friends he came with reported the situation to his family in the Netherlands when he was unable to reach Hoffman despite all the calls.
Police also moved to find the missing turkey, while his brother Robin Hoffman and friends Angelo Durei and Jaimy Gewald travelled to Adana.
ILANLAR BASTIRIP DANGITTI
Robin Hoffman, who applied for police there, distributed the missing advertisements in Adana and Mersin to help locate his brother.
Robin Hoffman said they last received news from the network on July 8, adding: "We first approached the police in the Netherlands."
We then came to Turkey with two friends and approached the police there.
So far, we haven't found a clue why we haven't received any news.
"Until my mouth is found, we will stay in Turkey until a notice is received," he said.
World second Ayse Ceren congratulates minister
At the 2017 Palm Swimming Junior World Championships in Russia, national athlete Ayse Ceren Yesilbas placed second in the world in the 400 m water polo event.
Youth and Sports Minister Osman Ashraf Bak congratulated Ayse Ceren Yesilbas, who won a silver medal for her message.
On the first day of the 2017 Palm Swimming Junior World Championships in Russia, Ceren Yesilbas placed second in the world in 400 m water.
Ceren took her place in the second-place curtain with a spectacular performance in the parlour, where she competed with 8 finalists, while she missed the gold medal with just 27 salutes.
Elena Lopatina of Russia won the gold medal in the 400 m, with a time of 03.18.73 minutes, while Ceren won the silver with a time of 03.19.00.
Turkey is represented by 8 male and 8 female athletes.
His last words were 'I'm dying, my eldest mother'.
Among those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which has so far been revealed to be 30, he called his mother at the time of the fire, saying: "I don't want to be killed, mother, that's not fair at all."
"Thank you for everything you've done for me, eloquent," it was announced, as did Italy's Gloria Trevisan and her loved ones.
Among the scores of people who could not be named after the fire were Gloria Trevisan, 26, who was sitting on the 23rd floor of the 24-storey building, and Italian favourite Marco Gottardi.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer for the Trevisan family in northern Italy, said in a statement that it was clear that the two teenagers had died, according to information from British authorities.
The families of the young are suffering a lot, he said, asking reporters not to insist on an explanation.
I think I'm dead, my eldest mother
Attorney Sandri said Gloria called her mother, Emanuela Trevisan, on her mobile phone shortly after the fire broke out, and when she listened to these last conversations the mother recorded, she cried.
By contrast, Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother a few times over the course of the 2 hours after the fire, which began around 1am local time.
"Anne, bad things happen here, the fire broke out," said Trevisan, who was said to be quieter in his first speeches.
We were drunk, we can't get outside.
There's a bit of smoke, but we're waiting to worry, to be rescued.
"We tried to get out by opening the door, but there was a lot of smoke and the elevator wasn't working," he was quoted as saying.
Gloria Trevisan, who raised concerns in her subsequent searches as the fire grew, was quoted as saying in her latest remarks:
Mother, my whole life goes through the front of my eyes.
I think I'm dead.
There was a life I would live in before; that's not fair at all.
I don't want to be killed and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I won't be able to embrace you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me, my eldest mother.
I'm going to heaven now and I'm going to help my skin straight away.
This is the fault of the italia government
Gloria Trevisan and her loved ones Marco Gottardi, who both studied architecture, moved to London from the northern Veneto region in March when they were forced to find a job after graduating last year.
Gloria Trevisan, who was only able to find a job in her country with a salary of 300 euros, soon started working in London on a job with a monthly salary of 1,800 euros (about 2060 euros).
Lawyer Sandri said Gloria Trevisan's family had been struggling financially, adding: "Gloria had gone to London to help her family."
Unfortunately, our young people are forced to leave the country to save their future and find work.
"The government must find a solution to this problem immediately," he said.
The drama of Italy, which has failed to provide jobs for its youth
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, also expressed his anger, saying, "This is the fault of our government, which is forcing our young people to flee abroad to find work."
In Italy, the unemployment rate has reached 12%, while among young people it has exceeded 40%.
As a result of the growing problem, many Italian young people have emigrated to many European countries over the past few years, especially in the UK.
Last year alone, the number of young people forced to leave Italy due to unemployment exceeded 110,000.
Italian media commented on the certainty of reports of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi's death, saying it was the drama of a country that failed to provide jobs for its youth.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could ease IBH
Red meat and chocolate can sound like an ear nightmare for your skin system.
But a new study claims the opposite: A nutrition rich in meat-based protein and dairy products can help relieve signs of those suffering from hypothermia stroke.
This untreatable health condition, which affects 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes migraines and inflammation, repeated or bloody asthma, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually advised to jump off meat and dairy products to ease their signs, but researchers at the University of Washington found that the protein's main aminoasidi triptocin helps develop immune cells that develop a resistant cord.
Lead researcher Dr Marco Colonna testified that immune cells patrol the cord so that the microbes stored in the yeast do not secretly enter the body.
The cells, which are capable of triggering dehydration, are balanced with cells that encourage them to withstand by protecting sensitive tomatoes without harm.
If the balance shifts too much towards hypothermia, it can become a result of hypothermia.
The experiments found a form of immune cell that encourages resilience in farmland carrying a specialized bacteria in their joints.
And the bacteria needs triptocin, one of the building stones of the protein, to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: 'We have linked the type of bacteria that is part of the corrosive microbiome to the development of cell populations that encourage resilience with Lacúillus reuter.'
Fats with more triptofan in their teeth had more of these immune cells, 'she said.
If the same happens in humans, L. reuteri and triptofan-rich nutrition could develop a more durable, less hypothetical context, he said.
Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganis, a post-doctoral researcher, has been working on a form of immune cell that develops resilience, discovering that a group of experimental fares have such cells, but no other group that is of the same kind and kept in a different place has it.
He suspected that the disparity was related to bacteria, virus and mushroom communities, which live in the coral microbiome of the farmland, or, as normal, the migraine-cord channel.
DNA transfusions of Farmers' cords have been made, and it has been found that there are six types of bacteria in farmland with immune cells, but this is missing in farmland where they are not.
L. reuterine has been given to farmworkers who are missing a stroke microbiome because they are being looked at in a sterile environment and have not developed such an immune cell, and immune cells have emerged.
To understand how bacteria affects the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts from this liquid, which is bacterial to mature immune cells taken from fares.
Immune cells have become cells that encourage resilience.
The active component was found to be a byproduct of triptofan metabolism, known as indol-3-lakh acid, when purified from the liquid.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptofan in the nutrients of the fares, the number of cells increased by around 50 per cent, but when triptofan levels were cut in half, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan said people have cells that encourage the same durability as fares, and most of us are home to L. reuterine in the migraine-cord channel.
It is not known whether triptofan side products from L. reuteri develop as they are in humans as well, but disorders in the genes that are related to triptofantasy have been found in people with hypothermia stroke disease.
He said: "The development of these cells is something we probably want to encourage because these cells control the hypothesis on the inner surface of the cord.
Potentially, in cases where L. reuteri is present, a high level of triptofan causes this population to spread. "
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'dagger' with Nemanja Matic
After the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening, Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a "dazzle" with Nemanja Matic.
The £40 m transfer from Chelsea kicked off with a 2-1 win in Dublin ahead of United's UEFA Super Cup win over Real Madrid on Tuesday in their last pre-season game, and Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were keeping an eye on the lack of the position that kept them in as they rushed forward according to their enjoyment.
But Matic, who was left out in the Blues' pre-season Asian tour, had a serious match concussion and was able to take just 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted it needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs the foundation, but his experience, his intellect, his delight in his way of thinking... he's thinking about football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to get ready sooner," he said.
Mourinho began to sweep into his top 11 for the start of the season, while, like Matic, his new transfer mates Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also made their debut at the Aviva Station.
This week, The Independent revealed that Mourinho still wants another 3 transfer but the club have already insisted he has done an "extraordinary job" by carrying out three of his four priority transfers.
"I thank the club for taking three of them yesterday," he added.
"I would be happier if they got four out of four, but they made a great effort for me," he said.
Last year, 197 people were sent to hospital
According to data from the Swedish Social Welfare Authority, the definition of gender discontent, which was introduced in 2005 to 1 in a hundred people, rose to 8 in a hundred in 2015.
Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital was referred to 197 people, mostly children and young people, who were unhappy with the gender in which he was born last year.
Lousise Frisen, a pediatric psychiatrist at the same hospital, said the increase could be due to the fact that it has become a more open society, adding that "openness in the psychoactive-transgender area, which includes questions about sexual identity, can be perceived as a general development in society."
The discomfort of gender discontent is known to have no connection to the sexual trend.
Drug bust in Izmir
Officers from the Metropolitan Police's Bureau for Combating Trafficking and Organised Crime carried out an operation at the home of the 36-year-old F.T. in Ulker Street, on September 3, after a tip.
A search of the home found a delicate terrace with 33 extacy hair.
The F.T., who jumped from the balcony and tried to escape, was arrested and taken into custody.
It was noted that the F.T. would be transferred to the courthouse after its proceedings in the order.
Evans on a transfer to the New Maltese
One of the super-League's new teams, Evkur New Maltese, has linked wing-back Turgut Dogan Sahin to his collarbone last season.
He has signed a 2-year contract with the 29-year-old wing-back as part of his transfer work, according to the yellow-card club.
It added: "A 2-year deal has been reached with wing-back Turgut Dogan Sahin, who has been stripped of his captaincy.
We are thrilled with our new Maltese, "the statement read.
The Briton inventor wore his own micro-chip to enter his home and car in a hand move
A British inventor has become the first person in the country to wear a micro-chip so he can open his front door, access his office and even run his car with only one hand.
Steven Northam (33) has moved his mint chip into his involvement, and is now offering the service with a BioTeq tool to businesses and people who want to facilitate their lives with technology.
He went on to collaborate with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure can be applied to medical standards.
The technology is similar to the micro-chip transported to goats and dogs and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also make changes to locks in homes and vehicles, including £300 per key, to be compliant with the chip.
This technology has been installed on both his home and the BMW Z4 of the man, who is married and a father of one, and works the vehicle while his hands are in the crosshairs.
White House Immigration Could Made taxpayers into bins
According to military records released to Time, the White House's decision last month to fly a marine pigeon helicopter to the southern grass for an event that propelled American production cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
When the president boarded, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the focus of attention at the White House in organizations promoting the July 17 American building programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officers have toured products produced across all 50 counties.
The helicopter in Connecticut was displayed side-by-side with a yacht from the main, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forkliff from Mississippi.
According to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for running the helicopter, the White House Military Service requested the helicopter's availability with an individual order (FRAGO is also working) just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the southern grass for the "unusual" event.
"I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an extraordinarily high-visibility organisation," the commander of HMX-1 sent an email to the superintendent, the Marine Corps Aerospace Command, a day before the event.
The message was that the helicopter would arrive on the southern grass for the event at 3am on the morning of July 17 and stay there until the steam is cleared between 6am and 9pm.
The note added that if an exit from the White House is delayed, a second flight crew would be required for the return Flight because of the time limits.
The unit's security personnel were on the ground carrying air, while the original flight crew was in a helicopter at the time of the event.
It is not clear whether a second flight crew from the records cleared to Time is necessary after all.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 is investigating whether the organization violated that requirement.
"One question we asked was whether he violated the Hatch Act and he reportedly did not give us," the commander-in-chief wrote.
"It seems you were kitted out," he replied, acting Commander-in-Chief.
The "Made in America" organization is designated as an official organisation by the White House and does not fall under the Hatch Act.
But even official organizations have political impediments.
At the event, the president addressed the ongoing health-care reform efforts in the senate then and praised efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using air submarines known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents need to use them to travel.
But it is unusual for them to be formally asked to use only for an opportunity to take a photo.
When Trump advanced to the stage of his first campaign rally in Melbourne Florida, the presidential plane in the branch, and his Twitter account was full of messages about the use of his predecessor's presidential plane, he drew attention.
White House deputy press spokesman Lindsay Walters said: "The White House is excited about the 'Made in America' exhibition, where products made with American materials are made by American workers from all 50 counties."
The HMX-1 crew often makes training flights in the Washington area and exercises to leave the US President on the southern grass with a spot-kick to the White House.
When Trump was in Germany for the G-20 summit in early July, he conducted 58 exercise executions at the HMX-1 White House.
One official said the flight, which was for the Made in America organisation, counted on the air crew's need for training inside that month.
Unit helicopters flew for an additional 11 hours that day for "support tasks that have nothing to do with the commander-in-chief."
The White House said taxpayers did not take a burden on any other number involved in the organization.
A spokesman for Sikorksky said its firms were not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the southern grass.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and the exact costs incurred by organisers are hard to detect.
But according to the Department of Defense's hour-by-hour rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the Department of Defense's rate of welcoming VH-3D is $24,340 per flight time.
Unit records record the air submarine's flight time at 30 minutes from its headquarters in Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico Virginia to both sides.
The White House claims the helicopter's actual operating costs are well below that rate.
"It is very misleading to give taxpayers a giveaway by blowing out the expense-welcoming rate estimates," Walters said.
"These rate estimates cover the blanket costs involved in staff, maintenance and annual costs," he said.
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Department of Defense's expense fulfilment rates do not include staff costs, but include fuel, maintenance and contraception costs.
At the time, Sean Spicer, a former White House press spokesman, defended the use of the helicopter for that event.
"It's about illustrating what's been done here in anachronistic America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I guess the work of hundreds, even if not thousands, depends on it.
And I think we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans, like most Americans, work without exhaustion to do.
So, of course, it is appropriate to put it forward. "
It's not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while walking the southern grass for the event, but he stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump joked with the media about firm products in his own fleet and addressed Sikorsky representatives.
"I know Sikorsky very well," he said, "and there are 3 of them on the bench."
President Erdogan's goal-scorer
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan watched Fenerbahce's rematch against Austria's Sturm Graz in the UEFA Europa League 3rd qualifying round.
Fenerbahce took a 1-0 lead in the 32nd minute with Dirar's header.
President Erdogan, who watched the match with great interest, was delighted with Fenerbahce's dominating goal.
Narcon 3rd season episode: The Cali Brothers highlights with the departure of Pablo Escobar in Netflix's hit series
Despite the revelation of Pablo Escobar's mural in the second season, Netflix's series doesn't look like a bite.
The third and fourth season has already been confirmed by the online broadcast service, with the first offering ideas about the bad characters of the coming period when it gets its first episode.
With the third season, the DEA is turning its attention to the world's richest drug trafficking organisation: The Cali Brothers
They are administered by four powerful mafia bosses and run "like a Fortune 500 company," but with more government bribes and violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is the mastermind, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) runs Mexico connections, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is stationed in New York.
In the new episode, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the character who provided support to American and Colombian colonial forces in the war against drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will be broadcast for the first time on September 1.
Afghan democracy depends on women's political role, says B.M.
The head of the B.M. mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that if all parts of society, including women, played a role, the election could be represented.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the B.M. Relief Mission, says hundreds of women are competing in villainous council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," she said in Wednesday's statement.
If only women participate fully and are included in all parts of the election process, they can be truly representative and reliable.
The Afghan villain council and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban has made threats against the election process, which comes at a time when international military operations have turned into advisory missions.
This year's elections mark the first time a peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said the strong role of women would contribute to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered out of 3.6 million registered voters.

GMB concerns over investment in McVitie's Glasgow factory
A union is seeking assurances from executives at biscuit maker McVitie's that a long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow will be made.
GMB Scotland said the company remained silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross area.
More than 500 people are employed at the plant, which also produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVitie's owner Pladis said they had invested more than £5 m in the area over the past few years.
If there is a change in their operations, employees and union representatives will be "first informed," he added.
In a letter written to the company's facility manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's to "address concerns that funds are not being provided for upgrading production banknotes."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "The failure to see a berth from the facility's chief executive on business needs and the investment plan for Tollcross's future is deeply concerning to our members.
For generations, families have been working here and are concentrated in Glasgow and its suburbs, the critical basis for adequate employment in the local community and in an area where there is high unemployment and social deprivation.
From a business, pay and welfare perspective, against the Brexit conditions, rising living costs and chronic production decline, Glasgow's east end is "urgently in need of a four-head mammoth manufacturing presence at McVitie's."
A female spokesman for Pladis said: "The director of the facility at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland more yesterday and the company will respond directly as we value our commitment to workers and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting in Tollcross two months ago with employees and GMB representatives, where a few issues were openly discussed.
Then we told our employees that, like all companies that do business in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment, we are continually reviewing our operations in order to remain competitive, which applies to all our businesses and facilities.
He added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5 m in the Tollcross facility, especially in production banknotes and operational development.
We fully recognise Tollcross's legacy as a production facility, and the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know if there is any change in our operations at the facility. "
Necip and Utku in Besiktas for another 4 years
The Besiktas Club has extended the contract of Necip Uysal and Utku Yuvakuran to 4 years.
A section on the Turkish Football Federation's (TFF) website, containing data on players, showed Besiktas extended a contract with the two players until May 31, 2021.
Necker, who grew up in the infrastructure of the black-and-white team and made his first professional contract on June 19, 2008, started playing for the A-team during the 2009-2010 season.
The 1991-born player, who rose to team captain, played in a total of 254 official matches for Besiktas.
The TFF website also reported that Besiktas had been given the bonus of goalkeeper Utku Yuvakuran, who was included on loan last season, and that he had signed a contract with him until May 31, 2021.
Utku was removed from his temporary transfer status as of August 1, 2017, and on August 2, his license was renewed, the information appears on his website.
Utku Yuvakuran served mainly in matches in the Under-21 League at Besiktas, where he played on loan last season.
The young goalkeeper took part in just 2 Turkish Cup matches with a black-and-white jersey.
Has PSG warned Barcelona 3 years ago about Neymar's departure?
The La Liga side may have regretted their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give Neymar a takedown after submitting a bid to move the £189 m release clause, but have they warned Barcelona of plummeting the world record three years ago?
The sensational bid mocked the summer transfer window as the Ligue 1 team prepared to break the world transfer record more than double the previous amount Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season for £89 m.
With PSG proposing a weekly salary of £50 million after taxes, it shows that once the transfer is complete Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world and also the professional athlete who earns the most.
Despite a source close to Catalan's management insisting from Santos' arrival in 2013 that the club had always done their best to keep an eye on him, Barcelona are known to be angry over the style of the offer and Neymar's attempt to leave.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president about this landscape?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stark warning to all clubs looking to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll be against them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they continue to sign one of our players, they will suffer the consequences. "
Spanish club Barcelona appear to have crossed that line earlier this summer, expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG have made it clear they will not allow the Italian nation to leave in any circumstances, and Barcelona feel the reflection of that interest well by losing one of their biggest values, Neymar.
Sentence for blocking Sala reading overturned
The defendants, Kenan Gulshen and Nait Yilmaz, who allegedly walked over and tried to block Kucukandonyadis Gultepe Mosque's Imami Mustafa Baki, who was studying crushing and flooding, were arrested in Istanbul on charges of "knowingly and willfully aiding the organisation while not a member," "resisting duty" and "insulting."
He has been tried by the International Criminal Court.
One of the defendants, Gulshen, was ordered to give up the victim's complaint on charges of "insulting the public official for his position" and to pay a fine of 7,000 euros, taking into account the manner in which the crime was committed. The trial chamber sentenced Yilmaz to 1 year in prison for "resisting duty," taking into account the importance of the victim's duty to the public and the future of Turkey, as of the date and time of the crime.
The delegation ruled that Yilmaz's prison sentence should be converted to a fine of 6,000 euros.
Following the sentencing of the two defendants, the defendant's lawyers filed a request for parole.
The case is being reviewed by the Istanbul District Court of Appeals for the 23rd Circuit.
He arrived at the Criminal Office.
Wrapping up their review, the agency ruled that the sentence handed down against defendant Kenan Gulshen for "insulting" was lawfully applied, that the act was justified and that it complied with the type of crime envisioned in the law, and that the sentence against him should be annulled.
"Neither the crush, nor the flood, you put the nation on the street," the Supreme Court said when the defendant, Nait Yilmaz, read a selfie and confronted imam Mustafa Baki, who was out of the mosque.
The president has been taken.
"This job is over," he said, adding that his act of attempting to walk, hit and run was a crime of "resisting the task" by acknowledging that the imagination of the victim had caused him to be unable to read the crush and salute he had to read at certain intervals.
Although cited by the local court as the grounds, the action took place when the victim had completed the task of reading selfies and crying and informing the public in front of the mosque, the agency said, noting that in the concrete case, there was no task in which the victim had started his execution or continued, and that he had been convicted on insufficient grounds, regardless of whether he had created the offence of attempting to wound the victim because of the public duty he was carrying out, and without being explained to allow him to supervise how the victim's admission that he was trying to obstruct the duties he would later carry out.
It said there was no concrete material damage to the victim due to his lack of patience and the crimes committed against him, adding that it was not discussed whether the moral damage would be applied in the face of the failure to prevent the release of the verdict and the fact that the victim had given up his complaint.
The verdict has been overturned, and the agency, which considers the appeal claims made by the lawyer for the defendant, Sanik Nait Yilmaz, on these grounds, has ruled that the verdict against him should be overturned, and that the case should be handed over to the first-degree court.
6 Europeans on Interpol's live bomb list
German newspaper Die Welt reported that Interpol (International Police Service) sent a list of 173 people with the potential to carry out suicide bombings on behalf of the terrorist group DEA last May to police in European countries.
The 132 people on the list are reportedly from Iraq, North Africa, the Gulf states, Tajikistan and Bangladesh.
The six people on the list are said to be European citizens.
They are said to have come from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Bosnia.
The man, who was linked to the DEA from Germany, was reportedly a 27-year-old German citizen from Solingen, North Ren Vestfalya.
In the fall of 2012, the man was said to have travelled first to Egypt, then to Turkey, and finally to Syria.
The DEA was quoted as saying on its social media accounts in mid-July that the man had died in Rakka.
The German Police Service did not respond to the paper's questions on the matter.
Those on Interpol's list were said to have been involved in operations against the DEA in Mosul.
According to Die Welt, American intelligence services reviewed the list and sent it to Interpol.
Interpol was also reported to have forwarded the list to police forces in Europe in May.
Citing German security circles, Die Welt said the IRA may have attempted to send some of those on that list to Europe to carry out suicide attacks.
The horror of being a soldier with a pumped rifle: 5-year-old Starter could lose his sights

Kaya said the incident occurred while her grandson was embracing her. "The celebration started at 8pm," she said.
It took 2 hours.
The fun of soldiers is completely over.
Young people have started to break up.
By the time it was over, it would have been one for us to get off.
At that moment, the gun exploded, it was in my full forehead.
My grandson's condition is not good.
They are likely to lose 80-90 per cent of their sights.
We spoke to the doctor, he said so.
They pulled out one of the legs and the other was in his eye.
"He's had a surgery, maybe he can have 10 surgeries," he said.
