Last minute: Cosmic visitor giant Asteroid 2014 JO25
There are billions of giant meteorites in the solar system that can cause serious consequences when they are adrift and colliding.
The path of these objects, which may have closed or open orbits from the formation of the sun, can sometimes pass through the earth.
650 meters in diameter asteroid 2014 JO25 Such a visitor and today at 14:24 "The closest place to Earth will go through 1.75 million kilometers away.
We've become more and more aware of this kind of news every day.
The most important reason for this is the developments in observation techniques and observation instruments.
In this way, we have the possibility to determine the smaller asteroids that were not previously detectable.
Last January, for example, an asteroid the size of a bus went through a distance of only half (~ 250,000 km) of Earth and moon distance.
And even more interestingly, the asteroid was determined only a few days before the passage.
So there could be other cosmic buses coming at us right now.
Imagine what you would do if you heard that an asteroid 20 meters in diameter would fall right in the middle of your neighborhood.
In fact, asteroids of this size don't destroy your neighborhood, but the windows of the buildings will probably explode.
This will be due to the shock waves emitted from the asteroid that will explode in the atmosphere.
For example, the asteroid that crashed in Russia in 2013 was this size, and it was enough to tear the windows of buildings in several cities.
However, if you have a neighborhood in the target of a 100-metre-wide asteroid, you have to go at least 50 miles from your neighborhood of advice.
Criteria such as the size of the asteroid and the angle of impact are the factors that determine the depth of the crater and the damage of the impact.
Let's take a look at a few scenarios according to the simulation of the European Space Agency.
If a 100 m diameter asteroid hits the Earth at an angle of 45 degrees at a rate of 60 miles per second, a crater with a depth of about 250 meters and a diameter of 1200 meters is formed.
The impact is equivalent to the 6-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, and it is the third in your body even if you are 10 km away from the point of impact. The degree of burns occurs.
50 km away will be waiting for the shattered window windows.
If an asteroid hits a mile in diameter, the situation gets even more depressing.
If such an asteroid hits Earth with the same angle and speed, a crater of approximately 600 meters deep and a diameter of 12 km is formed.
So a whole neighbourhood becomes a crater, and it's destroyed instantly.
3. Even if you are 100 km away from the point of impact due to the heat caused by the impact. The degree of burns occurs.
The impact is equivalent to an 8-magnitude earthquake based on the Richter scale.
The damage to the asteroid depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid but also the rock structure of the region.
The above values are given to the scenario that occurs if a hard rock-like asteroid falls into a region composed of sediment rocks.
If the asteroid is mostly iron, the crater will increase by 3 times if it falls to a place with a surface formed by the cooling of the lava and the resulting catastrophe will endure.
66 million before that, something worse happened to the dinosaurs, and they were exposed to a catastrophe that was struck by an asteroid about 10 km in diameter.
Because of the asteroid stroke, 75 percent of sea and land creatures disappeared instantly.
If a large asteroid that destroys dinosaurs is targeting Earth, make sure the most robust option is to abandon the planet.
There are tons of substances falling from space to earth every day.
Most of them burn in the atmosphere.
Some meteors that are large enough are burning in the atmosphere, causing flashes known as stars shifting among the people.
Let's end it with another story that will comfort our writing.
Studies show that a giant asteroid is not expected to hit the earth for the next 300-400 years, which will cause serious devastation.
As the living creatures of the average 70 years, I'm sure you have a little bit of relief.
Flash claim for Medel: 10 million Euro!
In order to reinforce the stopper region of black-and-whites on the agenda of the name from the Intertermed Gary Medel...
After wearing a uniform in the Confederations Cup with Chile, a 30-year-old footballer who has been on vacation and started working with the Interter recently, expects the future proposals.
The prestigious newspaper of the Italian Gazzetta dello Sport, both the Stoper and the front libero Medel for the task of Besiktas, the Inter said that he made a bid of 10m euros.
Medel offering the offer of black-and-whites, both sides expected to answer, while the Chilean football player in Istanbul to live with his family said he looked hot.
In spite of Gazzetta's claim, Black Eagle, which is a limitation of FFP, is very difficult to pay for Medel, such as 10m euros.
Black-and-whites first, as in the transfer of Caner Erkin to turn to Medel through the lease or a serious discount on the testimonials in case the star player is likely to add to the staff.
Besiktas Negredo transfer to the stock Exchange reported
The human rights group issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National People's Advancement Association has issued a warning for coloured men who will travel to Missouri, due to the province's discriminatory policies and racial attacks.
The statement of the group is as follows: "The NAACP travel recommendation of the State of Missouri is valid from August 28, 2017, and the recent dubious, racial-based events of African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri Because it is coming, as stated there, it recommends that they take special care and be extremely cautious as they travel from beginning to end of the province. "
NAACP; A new Missouri law has made it difficult for people to win discrimination cases, but also the province's law enforcement to target minorities disproportionately, it is effective for the group to broadcast this travel warning.
"There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They're stopped, beaten and killed by the color of their skin. "said Kansan City Star to Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel.
"We hear complaints we haven't heard before."
This is the first time the association publishes such a warning for a state in the United States.
The group has shown an example of racial insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
At the beginning of this year, Sanders was detained and died under suspicious circumstances, after the end of his fuel in the state, after the Missouri police were accused of a crime.
The declaration of recommendation also points out a new report of the Missouri attorney's office, which shows that black drivers in the province are likely to be stopped by 75 per cent more than whites.
"The recommendation is for people to be vigilant and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People should be ready to bring bail money with them, inform their relatives that they will pass through this state."
In Missouri, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015, according to the latest figures in the FBI's Hate crimes program; This puts the 16th in the country in terms of the number of similar violations in the province.
The travel alert is also a response to a new Missouri law where a workplace is more difficult to prosecute when renting housing or giving a job discrimination.
Previously, the American Association of Civil Liberties (ACLU) published travel advice for Texas and Arizona after the local enforcement authorities of these States had issued immigration enforcement laws that ordered people to arrest for immigration violations; ACLU says it will increase applications according to the race.
Travel alerts are usually published by the State Department for other countries, but recently defense groups are applying to this application in response to a number of laws and trends in the United States.
Besiktas Demba Ba OK
2 seasons before the Chinese team in exchange for 13 million euros Shanghai Shenhua, and last season's rent to black-whites ' a rented Demba Ba, for free Besiktas "returns.
Senegalese player asked for a detailed health report last week, Black Eagle, star football player after the report took action.
Black-and-white management, which began working for the 32-year-old player who did not think of the Chinese representative in the next season, rang the door of Shanghai team.
Not written to list
Unlisted in China due to the presence of foreign status Demba Ba, black-and-whites wanted to go back to the management conveyed.
The Chinese team approved the departure of the 32-year-old player.
Senegaleus footballer coming to Turkey in the coming days, the official contract is expected to sign.
Castillo was operated by Trabzonspor
Bordeaux-Blue Club's website in the statement, Castillo, the left knee in Istanbul Liv Hospital, said that the operation of arthroscopic meniscus, "Prof. Dr. Ugur rights performed by the post-op player, 4 It is expected to start training with the team during the week. " Statement.
Castillo was injured in the right back, in a preparatory match with the Dutch team Heerenveen at the Slovak camp in the Bordeaux-Mavili team.
Because of the treatment, the Colombian player, which will remain away from the field for 3-4 weeks, was determined to be operated due to the meniscus problem he had previously experienced.
Barzan's referendum exit!
Barzani held a speech at the memorial ceremony in Duhok, due to the 3rd anniversary of the terrorist organization Deaş attacking the Ezidils in the Sinjar district of Mosul.
In his speech, Barzani, referring to the independence referendum that Ikby wanted to organise on September 25th, said: "I regret to say this, we have no hope that Iraq will be a true and proper country."
We tried all the roads with Iraq, but we were completely helpless and hopeless.
Our past experiences with Iraq have brought us to this position and there is no guarantee that we can take our rights and protect them.
So we need to demonstrate that we can all be able to assign our fate to the world through a referendum to ensure life and safety together.
I have to underline this. The referendum is not a goal for us, but a tool for achieving a bigger goal.
After the collapse of the Ba'as regime, the Iraqi central government has made many promises to the Kurds after the 2003, Barzani said, soon after the fight against the Deaş, the decision of a direct referendum He said it was taken.
In a peaceful and democratic way for the protection and development of the people of the city of Ikby voicing wishes to designate the fate of Barzani, "the documents emerged, such as a state of Iraq does not want to protect us, or to preserve."
"He doesn't want us to move forward." defended his opinion.
During the fight against the terrorist organization Deaş, the government of the Iraqi central, but in a short period of time, a fatwa established by the HASDI Şabi'nin immediately legalised and reacted to the provision of all weapons Barzani noted that:
In the defense system of Iraq, Peshmerga was not addressed.
The central government did not make it to the peshmerga.
The peshmerga is regarded as a part of the Iraqi defence system, according to the constitution.
But when the Shabi had no constitutionof the constitution, all the opportunities were violated by breaking the law.
We are not saying we are against the HASDI.
The Peshmerga and the King's Temple fought on the same front, and why, on the one hand, is the presence of a pest and the struggle for terrorism, the existence of the passican and the fight against terror.
These are our deepest wounds to Baghdad.
On August 3, 2014, the terrorist organization Deaş staged an attack on the ezidils in the Sinjar district of Mosul, killing many people, including women and children.
10 minutes to return to disaster
According to the BBC, the Air France airline's Boeing 777 passenger plane was in the west of Hokkaido, north of Japan, when the northern Korean missile was airborne.
The missile, the plane was located 10 minutes ago, the authorities noted that the missile was estimated to be approaching the plane 100-150 kilometers.
Air France said the missile did not intersect with the plane's route and there was no problem with the flight.
"The information we have at this stage shows that the missile crashed into the sea more than 100 kilometers away from the plane's route". Statements.
Nothing sacred?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty
The most accurate sign of regime change is that they start attacking the statues.
The Americans know as much as any of this; As a matter of fact, the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003 at Firdos Square in Baghdad...
Stephen Miller, one of the key theorist of the Trump regime, is precisely what the president of CNN, Jim Acosta, and the chairman, in a heated debate about the proposals for a harsh restriction on legal immigration, while destroying the Statue of Liberty in a symbolic way He knew he was doing it.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
If he did, he'd have a full boat tour and a Freedom impersonator lynching him.
But he attacked her meaning, especially in 1903, after the memorial itself was completed 17 years later, when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to the memorial base.
"I don't want to be here to talk history from start to finish, but Statue of Liberty... American freedom is the symbol of light nonsense to the world.
The poem you mentioned was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller's actually right, but as he said, it's not really about history.
This is about the contemporary echoing of the eerie words of Lazarus, but it seems that only a state invites not only some elderly immigrants, but also the poor in the poorest: "Tired, poor,/crammed masses to take the breath of freedom Longing,/crammed, the wretched of the land. "
There never was a time when the "miserable being" was so visible on our screens.
Miller did not bring a literary criticism; It was explained that these people were not welcome in Trump's United States.
The conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: this is actually a conflict with the meaning of America.
After Lazarus and his death, his friends who campaigned to put his words in the base of the statue knew very well that they had entered a very political act.
The statue intends to celebrate the connections between French and American republics with a stereotypical metaphor, representing freedom as a woman's body.
Lazarus changed this mantra: The woman's figure in her poem was no longer abstract, she had a voice.
And it gives him a very different name: The mother of the banished.
The image and marriage of the poem is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American immigration.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wing wanted to change it back for a long time.
For Trump's arrival, a Baptist John-style big-braver, Rush Limbaugh, argued that in 2010, Freedom didn't invite anyone in, but it was a neocon, an early era that holds more American fires in the Dark World: "Lady Liberty stands Out.
He's got the Freedom torch to move from the United States to the rest of the world.
Not to let the torch illuminate the way to the United States. "
In a very unusual way, Limbaugh actually discovered something.
The meaning of the statue was all about the perception angle.
The Glorious Creative act of Lazarus; To see it as being seen on the decks of ships after long and often terrible journeys by exhausted, miserable but hopeful people.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people looking for shelter and trying to heal their lives.
His statue responded to them with the words of hope and the warm greeting they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not a perspective that Miller and Trump are going to justify in any way.
Their torch is not to lead, but to exacerbate the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black prails The Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle remembers only when two israms could enter the Great Britain team.
Neil Black, the director of the UK Athletics performance, says the group of 16 people in the World Championship squad will provide "a huge contribution to the team".
The record-breaking Scottish athlete was elected for London 2017, which began on Friday.
Black believes that "something is developing" in Scotland and that the UK Athletics should learn from it.
"We're adopting this, and we're trying to figure it out, and we're going to deal with it until we get out of it," Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Iskoc Sports Institute, and they think it's about what they're doing.
The Scottish athlete thinks it's about what he's doing.
British Athletics: He thinks it's about what they're doing.
So is the guy on the street in the corner.
No matter the combination of terms, this is absolutely wonderful. "
Laura Muir and 5000, including Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah, are competing for the medal, while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain by the squad.
"Eilidh is a little modest.
The captain's speech was unbelievable, "says Black.
"Whether they're a coach, or wherever they live or practice, a few athletes have been very proud and really motivated by that room.
The passion and true feeling of Eilidh's natural way was great. "
The silver Medalet from the Commonwealth of Nations, which will compete in the fifth World Championships in the 400 m hurdles, says 16 Iskoc is "incredible" on the British team.
The best total athlete figure in the previous world championships in Scotland was seven, 1983 and 2015 years.
Last year, five Britain and two European record-breaking middle-distance runners, Muir leader.
1500 m and 5000 m to participate.
A very good season, including the British team trials and victories in the Anniversary Games, Chris O'Hare, who runs at 1500 m, is another Scottish coach.
Doyle remembers the first championship in the team to be Lee McConnell.
The team captain says he is "very proud", as many of his countryman will not only enter the team, but in some cases compete for the medal and fight for the finals.
"The special part of being a team captain was that it was the votes given by other members of the team, so it was already a great honor, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and that you chose you made it extra special for me," he added.
"Frankly, I am proud of all the coaches that have joined the team.
That shows us how far we've been.
And they, as proven athletes, are here as athletes who watch out for the podium.
As for the captain's speech?
Yes, I think it went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we were so lucky in this situation, that in this regard, there is a world championship in our house.
So, this is actually just the effect of taking advantage of this inner-field support and our success with the fact that we have returned to the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and fight, and there will be such a great atmosphere. "
Block critics on Facebook: If you can't afford to criticise voters, be a candidate for government duty
The father of our country had a certain amount of information about getting negative in the press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to start criticize him for everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course, he was uncomfortable with criticism.
But he didn't silence the critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be eliminated and we can be dragged to the slaughter in a stupid and quiet way."
This brings me to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 people who voiced their ideas on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff ignored the case on the grounds that it was not serious, and online comments were full of "who cares?" reactions.
A lot of people said, "This is just Facebook."
But it's important.
It's especially important when you're like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor who is surprisingly popular in a state that is overwhelmingly Democrat.
He has the second highest degree of approval among the 50 governor of the country.
Hogan's not a reactionary lunatic.
He was leading the state and skillful in strict devotion to principles.
He was also very skilled at using Facebook as the primary tool to connect with his constituents, with a playful introduction to his hairless head after chemotherapy.
In other words, it is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people who come to the page of the governor, which is a public forum, officially described and managed by members of the people who paid the public's tax dollars.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's female spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was not more than organizing them.
But it's easy to use the images of trolls or spammers or hateful people attacking online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people who only speak to elected leaders: a teacher, a workplace owner and a pastor; It's not a troll.
They all said that their interpretation is respectful, thoughtful and abusive.
The pastor made a quote from the Bible by addressing Hogan's Catholic belief in his share.
The lawyer Lakshmi wrapping Ramani from Maryland Bowie was not full of hatred, but he asked questions about hate crimes.
"I have kindly commented that I am disappointed that he was gently disappointed in his hate crimes and other recent news," The Post's comments section wrote.
"I also do not like the idea that when many people comment on the same topic, immediately ignore it as a collective effort that is much more than a large group of concerned citizens."
Others would probably call it "idea advocacy" as the governor's staff called it "condensed spam attack".
The Facebook era makes it easy to easily make a message available through the prevention of a dissident or the deletion of a negative message.
It's much cleaner than the old days when the staff were sent out to collect and burn newspapers with critical papers, or arrest and silence the protesters.
But, even if it's digital, that's exactly what happens.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for neutralizing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who are blocked in the Twitter feed.
One of the future reference decisions on this issue came from Virginia last week.
According to James C. Cacheris, US District judge in Alexandria, the president of the Loudoun Administration Area Supervisors Committee acted contrary to the First Amendment when he banned a choice on Facebook.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (Republican) was visited by ACLU due to the use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington time, the reasonably priced mail transfer had a very similar effect to the Internet.
Between the years 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers was quadrupled and the authors of the unknown letters eroted his leadership.
Even then, Washington had trolls called unknown.
People who use aliases such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to the newspapers that have made Washington's decisions.
According to the online George Washington articles project, which collects historical documents, petitions criticizing his stance on the friendship, Trade and navigational agreement with Britain had overwhelmed his office.
But he didn't shut them down.
The expression, opposition and freedom of the manuscript are the most fundamental of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to be in the comfort of his home at the Renaissance Club
A former European number, Ronan Rafferty, is the 25th birthday of the Renaissance Club in South Lothian, the Scottish Senior Open, in the next three days. He hopes his home will be in comfort when he hosts his edition.
Before losing to Paul Eales at Archerfield Links, North Irish, who leads the final door, feels adherence to the new venue and acts as the envoy for the club's founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvadi.
Rafferty said, "I watched the Renaissance Club be built, and we see that it regained its magnificence with this organization."
Players will see the field in its best form, in a remarkable state.
Jerry did a remarkable job building this place.
He is a Yilmaz advocate of this game and is proud of his success here.
This is a great demonstration for the field. "
Despite winning both the Europen tour and the European Challenge Tour, the British Eales will be fighting for the first time in its 32-year career.
"This feels really special," said Southport-based player.
"I never had the chance to protect Extremadura Open because it was removed from the calendar the next year I won.
It's good to be back in this part of the world.
It's a great place to play Golf.
The memories from last year were alive and it was very special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a time when we were always going to be special and affectionate. "
At the beginning of this year, after entering the age of 50, Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour, is also returning to play in his field.
This organization will be the first Scotland competition since the Aberdeen Asset Management in 2013.
"When you fight inside, it always makes a little more sense," Helensburgh man Orr said.
"You want to do well, but you feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played golf.
I'm happy to be going so far. "
Those who participated in this trio on the field; Former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
ORR and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance are among the 6 coaches on the field; Others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation is free and parking is available; £5 per car with a person and £10 per car with two or more people.
All the profits are going to Prostate Cancer UK.
I found the answer
Imagine a "seat" that... Budget; More than the budget allocated to each of the eleven ministries, including the Ministries of Economy, Development, energy and natural resources, science industry and Technology, environment and urbanism, health, culture and tourism, with 6 billion 867 million Turkish lira!
Number of Personnel 117 thousand 378.
Turkey's largest "propaganda base!"
Yes, I'm talking about the presidency of religious affairs!
Yes, I'll talk about Mehmet Görmez, president of Religious affairs!
Days... Looking for answers to the question in my head...
I am curious about the real reason why Mehmet Görmez was taken from his seat...
I read every article about you being sent out.
No.
I can't find the answer to the question I'm looking for.
More at the beginning of this year...
Mehmet Görmez, the Directorate of Religious Affairs (DIB) 2017-2021 Strategic plan prepared.
President Erdogan, under 1 million pounds S 600 model Mercedes was filmed.
So he had no problem with Erdogan.
So what happened?
You can say, "Seven years of duty is not enough."
First DIB President M. Rifat Börekci served for 17 years.
You all know that Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz sat in the seat for 11 years.
So... The president's term is clear.
I return to my question: why did he leave his seat?
Business fell to the deal...
Shiite proximity
Close to power the source said:-"according to the traditional Ulemaya, Mehmet Dönmez did not possess the circumcision!"
The code for this sentence is the following: He didn't have the sunnish!
The person who wrote this sentence followed the following:-"Modernist was found by the traditional Ulama!"
I mean, Mehmet was seen as innovative.
What do you mean, innovativeness?
The answer to the question was hidden in a trip abroad by Mehmet Görmez.
Date: 27 December 2015.
Mehmet does not see, he went to Iran to participate in the 29th Vahdet Conference, which aims to bring about the Islamic sects to be held in Tehran.
Iran's religious leader met with Ayatollah Ali Hamaney.
Shiite prayed with the clergy by keeping it pure.
And at the conference, he said: "The denominations are the humanities that have formed over time, representing different ideas and opinions in understanding the religion of Islam."
The purpose of all is to determine the direction to God.
Each one is on a secondary road to the main road, but the location is the same.
It is never acceptable to listen to the sect, or to see the cult of religion above the Islamic family.
Decomposition, deduplication and conflict are the reflection of Taassubun and ignorance.
In the case of the religion of the sect, the most damaged religion was himself...
Here I want to emphasize again by underline:
Shiites and Sunnies are a single ummah...
"No one can be a single person because they perceive Islam as it is understood by itself"...
A year later...
The 30th Vahdet meeting was attended by only Caferi leader Selahattin Özgündüz from Turkey.
So...
Not Sunnilik, Vehbi Habilik
Mehmet Görmez's visit to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of the "traditional Ulema".
The next Tehran conference, representing the Turkish state--again--that was why no one attended.
Besides, Mehmet has not been invited four times since he came to the mission.
The reason was obvious; The anti-Iranian "traditional ulema" in Dib!
Immediately after the trip to Iran, the seat of Mehmet Görmez began to be worn from the beginning of 2016.
At the beginning of this, he was responsible for DIB-period-deputy Prime Minister Numan survived!
He saw that he drowned so much that he wanted to be connected to the presidency of Dib.
The essence of the work...
There was a difference in the state to look at the sunnish.
Some of the theoretical worlds that were created in Saudi Arabia and Egyptian madrasas were identified with the "traditional Ulema", the Sunnish-the shadow of the US-Wahhabi-selephilic!
These were Iranian opponents who had no tolerance for a trip to Tehran.
His remarks about Mehmet Görmez, the robe of the robes, were not surprising: "Diyanet did not come from this dangerous."
"My lord, who is loyal to the nation and a good chief of good will be blessed"...
The "Ehlisünneti" was used as the symbol concept of Iranian hostility.
A term made by the Fetö's--the anti-Iran-supported, new names were now running.
Moreover, the Fetökumpas...
A photograph of a young man with Whiskey "Mehmet Görmez's son" was served to the media with a lie!
Oh, what a coincidence!
Mehmet Görmez, who made the biggest opposition in the media: the newspaper of the US-controlled floodlight, Turkey!
Ultimately...
-Sunnish, the Saudi Wahhabi-Salafi line resisting not bringing...
-not fueled by sectarian separation...
-Modernist... A cleric, their consciousness was destroyed by the "traditional Ulema" created during the Cold War...
The US cultural imperialism continues to make Turkey a rapidly arabizism (Wahhabi-Salafi).
Do not doubt that the President of the future religious affairs will be the representative of the Wahhabi-Salafi!
"We support the protection of Turkey's sovereignty"
Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu went to China for an official visit.
Cavusoglu and Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi held a joint press conference at the state Guest house in Beijing.
"We hope that Turkey is more actively involved in international issues," Vang said.
China will support Turkey in its efforts to protect sovereignty, stability and security.
"We hope that Palestine is resolved with the international community, including Turkey," he said.
"Turkey, in search of close cooperation with regional and international organizations, is not an alternative to each other, it is complementary," Cavusoglu said in relation to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
The spirit is officially starting its second term.
Hasan Spiritual's presidency, which won the presidential elections in May in Iran, was approved by Ayatollah Ali Hamaney, the country's leader.
Hasan Rouhani, elected president for the second time in Iran, vowed at the ceremony attended by Ayatollah Ali Khamaney, the country's religious leader.
In addition to the high-level military and political names, as well as foreign representatives attended the ceremony, Turkey's ambassador to Tehran Riza Hakan Tekin participated in Turkey.
The spirit, who will serve as president for four more years, will officially be inaugurated on Saturday (August 5th) after the inauguration ceremony in Parliament.
The ceremony is expected to join Economy Minister Nihat Zeywatchdog, representing Turkey.

Poverty and death in the golden realm of Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use a cooker when cooking.
In fact, he rarely uses a container.
The housewife puts a sweet potato directly on fire, known locally as a "note," in the wooden house in Enarotali, Paniai, in the restless region of Indonesia, Papua.
Half an hour later, the roasted lump is removed and the appetite is wiped clean, hands unwashed.
Degei sits on muddy ground, where he does chores like washing laundry with fuzzy water from the nearby swamp, no furniture.
It serves as a bucket of Sahara in the house without a roof.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, he was never given a job in any field.
Polygamy is commonplace here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed and most of them drink, and there are soldiers.
"No one goes around the village after 5:00 p.m.," he says.
A former Dutch colony absorbed by Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, in which only 1026 elderly were forced to vote in public by force and hand, before the troops invaded, was the day of life in the mountainous regions of Papua A rare glimpse of the moment.
An existing movement that is propagating independence against the Dutch administration has quickly directed its anger to the Jakarta government, which prohibits the strict control over the region, banning foreign journalists or rights surveillance organisations.
In 2003, the region was formally divided into Papua and West Papua, where independent Papua New Guinea would occupy the eastern part of the island.
The Enarotali is far away and desolate; The journey here includes a 90-minute flight to Nabire from the regional capital, Jayapura, and a 5-hour car ride, which is a stomachache for rent.
No public transport.

There have been other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," Degei said, referring to the vibrant color, the hand-woven yellow, the dark shirt and the shiny skirt.
"We used to wear only leaves in our bodies."
Papua, Indonesia's poorest region, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have the worst children's death and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also the golden realm of Indonesia.
Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine owned by the Phoenix-based Freeport McMoRan, is only 60 miles away from Paniai, a mountainous region of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
Only in 2015, Freeport took out 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua estimated 78 billion in timber reserves.
But these riches, which are a source of misery for the Papuans, ensure that the mighty army of Indonesia is a suffocating being.
The New York Times ' 2005 survey reports that Freeport paid local military personnel and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including amounts of up to 150,000 dollars for a single officer.
The Papuans ' call for more autonomy threatens this golden goose and comes out mercilessly.
According to the rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papualı have been killed by the Indonesian army since 1969, and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
Mass killings in the mountainous parts of Papua in the 1970s reached the genocide figures according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Indonesian police only arrested more than 3900 peacekeepers in the region last year.
The "We will lose everything" report of the Archdiocese of Brisbane in 2016, the last year, illegal executions, torture (according to another report, especially popular with rape and electrocution) and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations Testimony.
"It's hard to calculate the number of victims because there are incidents every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at the Human Rights Watch.
Pressures have been increased as Papua's sources have brought settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The region's 3.5 million inhabitants are 83% Christian, but the demographics are changing as Muslim immigrants from Indonesia's crowded islands, Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi come for economic purposes.
Javalı Warung Buffets are selling the Gado-Gado served with peanut sauce mixed with fried chicken and vegetables.
The locals are struggling to compete.
"Immigrants sell chickens and vegetables cheaper than local papouts in traditional markets," explains Abeth you, 24, a native of Paniai, who moved to regional capital Jayapura for work.
"This caused the local Papuans to lose their market with their Papualı Mama-mama's (women)."
More commonly known as Jokowi, Indonesian President Joko Widodo pledged to resolve inequalities and violations of rights in Papua during the 2014 campaign.
While the former carpenter headed towards the presidential palace in Jakarta, 27 of the 29 regions of Papua, including Panaia, took the game.
But few things have changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in anticipation of the hope that justice will be reconstructed," he said.
In fact, Paniai suffered his worst condition only two months after Jokowi started his mission in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children went outside in Enarotali singing Christmas songs in front of a bonfire, while two Indonesian soldiers on the motorcycle split up in the darkness.
The frightened kids told them to turn their headlights on.
One of the soldiers resented his style, and according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, he later returned with four soldiers.
The victims and witnesses said that the soldiers who had taken alcohol chased the group and beat their rifles with their bottoms.
Then one of the soldiers fired at the children's group.
Yulianus Yeimo, a 16-year-old boy, was beaten so badly that he went into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set on fire and the next day the events climbed.
Up to 1000 men, women and children gathered to claim justice on a football field in front of the local police station and military command centre.
They were carrying ceremonial hunting springs and they had Waita's dance of the Me Pago tribe of Papua (by running in the form of a ring and mimicking the bird's singing).
Some of the protesters started throwing stones at the police and the military garrison.
The nerves were further stretched and the orders were sent to the soldiers via the internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them by shooting." This is an official document that was seen by the hiss, not disclosed to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the head of the Kego Koto neighbourhood in Enarotali, saw the approaching danger and demanded peace by calling the crowd to return home.
Nobody had any intention of listening.
"When I turned my back, I suddenly got shot in the left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of the wooden house painted in bright colors.
Kayame still doesn't know who's shooting, but he says the bullet came from a gathered military erattan.
"The crowd was shot many times," he added.
According to his cousin, who witnessed the attacks, the native Alfius Youw was shot three times.
Like many Indonesians, Yohanes known only by one name, "I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," he told the Hiss pessimistic.
"I saw him die... I kissed her. "
Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende of Papua police told reporters that his officers had only "secured" the outpost because the outpost was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, branch director of the Papua police spokesman in 2015.
"This is a matter of life and death."
According to human rights watchdog, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The news of the deaths reached Jakarta the next day.
Jokowi made an enthusiastic speech in Jayapura, three weeks later, promising to share the pain of the victims ' families and to resolve historical abuses in Papua.
He said, "I want this case resolved immediately so that it won't happen again."
In October 2016, security minister Wiranto said he established a non-forensic mechanism for historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations had been a long time ago.
Some in the ' 90s and some in the early 2000s.
The point is that we are determined to resolve these violations, but there are processes that we have to cross, "he said.
Speaking to Hiss on June 5th, Wiranto stepped back, saying there was no plan to build a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "it will all be resolved by the law."
The U.N. accused of "crimes against humanity" over 1,000 deaths during the bloody independence vote of East Timor in 1999, Wiranto said that the case of 11 human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, has already been resolved.
The families of the Paniai victims welcomed such allegations with a bitter scepticism.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there hasn't been any progress," Yohanes says.
"Tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
He says, "I'm scared."
"I'm afraid of being arrested by a soldier, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother, Yacobus, repeats the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by a soldier after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After burying the Naaşi, the soldier came looking for me," he says.
The attacks have not stopped yet.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police in Paniai's neighbour, Deiyai, were shot to the villagers.
One person died during the clash between the villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help a man who was not in the hospital, and 17 people were injured, including children.
A 24-year-old Ravianus Douw drowned in a nearby lake while fishing, died on the way to the hospital.
The angry villagers staged a protest in front of the company's site office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at the officers, and they reacted with a warning shot.
But the locals say the moving brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd and killed someone.
The 29-year-old Dominggu badii Hiss, who lived close to the hospital and witnessed that the wounded were raised, said, "We were so panicked, we feared revenge would be taken."
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
Deiyai's parliament urged the officers involved to be held accountable and the moving police brigade to withdraw from the region.
Paniai has always been a troubled region for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the displeasure of me, Moni, Dani and Damal tribal peoples living scattered throughout the green mountainous center of Papua.
Many participated in the rebellious army's free Papua Movement (OPM), claiming to protect the Papuans ' rights by making random attacks and kidnapping the Indonesian soldiers.
Some high-level OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, come from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and kept arbitrarily in recent years by the soldier under the guise of "protection of national sovereignty".
Some will never be seen again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as a "tragic and forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
A little bit of rice in the Enarotali sale is too expensive for the locals to buy.
The bread is unreachable.
The people here grow everything they eat: mainly notes, as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of women who can sustain sweet potatoes in four or five fields.
They usually hide most of the harvest for the family, sell the rest in the local market.
10 notes only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown among new immigrants, since the opening of new air routes to local Papuans and Nabire airport.
Jobs that are already less often go to immigrants who are better educated and richer.
The Papuans ' capital or necessary qualifications are rarely to carry out their own business as a competitive one.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no work or money here," said Panai Tribal Council President John Gobai.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes out of Papua.
Furthermore, the journalistic limitations for international media have been firmly in the stands.
Earlier this year, French journalist Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua to "lack of coordination with the relevant institutions", despite the rare permission to take a video.
According to Phelim Kine, assistant to the Asian director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has failed to remove the limitations of making news and development promises to increase the transparency of the election campaign.
In a statement, he said: "There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to make news from Indonesia's restless East end provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa rejection and blacklisted."
The lack of press supervision means that international pressure to the Indonesian government is mostly limited to neighbours in the immediate vicinity of Papua.
In March, the six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands) encouraged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries historically support OPM.
"The democratic system in Indonesia is still valid and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence in human rights cases," Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir said to reporters in Jakarta. Cared.
The locals want more foreign governments to deal with it.
When a formal delegation from Holland visited Jayapura on 4 May, chaired by the country's human rights envoy, Kees Van Baar, the local people "want Freedom" according to a source who attended the meeting and did not want the name to be disclosed. Broke his silence.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say it is unlikely that they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person with good intentions but is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai attack," said Gobai, president of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai have rounded up with small education and health services, except to live under the imminent threat of the tyrannical soldier.
Like the other Papuans, Gobai says he considers the Paniai people to pay their votes back to Jokowi as a "debt".
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the paniai attack victims carried out a final symbolic counteract: burying a victim's body in the land directly opposite the police and military outpost.
Knowing that justice can never be fulfilled, they will at least make them forget the crimes of those responsible.
"A member of our family was murdered," says Yacobus, with a forward-leaning head.
"What else can we do?"
The fire swept Dubai's ' torch ' skyscraper for the second time
A fire in Dubai on Friday forced the world's tallest residential towers to flee and hundreds of residents fled the 337-metre-long 79-storey building.
This is the second major fire that rapidly spans the high building, called the Torch Tower in two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no explanation was made about the cause of the Great Fire.
"We were sleeping and we woke up on a fire alarm, people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us 10 minutes to reach the 50th floor. "He spoke to a calm Reuters, who named him George.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said the fire brigade extinguished the large fire around 4 (00:00 GMT) in the local time, and cooled the building.
The government has announced that they are trying to provide shelter for the affected.
This event can re-raise questions about the safety of materials used in the outer parts of high-rise buildings around the world.
After the fire of Torch management in 2015, the investigation has found that most of the damage is in the outer panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the UK, police said they believed that the isolation and coating panel system on the Grenfell Tower of London, where 80 people died, could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June.

According to the poll, more than 1 out of 5 US passengers bring banned substances to the aircraft
According to the poll made by airline passengers, more than 20 per cent knowingly or unknowingly missed substances from the U.S. Transport Security Agency's checkpoints to the plane, without knowing that at least 6 percent of the banned knives or other sharp objects carrying Including.
Less than 1 percent later claimed to have noticed that he was traveling accidentally with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The research conducted by the Jet charter Service Stratos Jet Charters, with more than 1,000 people, also found that younger passengers are more prone to breaking the rules.
Among the participants who admit to trying to fly on purpose with something forbidden by the TSA is 19.7 per cent of the Y generation, but therefore less than 15 X generation members.
The most common substances that are intentionally kidnapped from TSA agents are food and fluids.
More than 3 per cent admitted to knowing that he was deliberately having sharp tools from security, while 2.2 per cent of female participants and 3.7 of the male participants also admitted that they were carrying banned drugs on the plane intentionally.
The company said it has been conducting surveys across the country to find out how many people accidentally brought contraband from airport security, and avoid doing so on purpose.
It's no surprise that the most likely people who knowingly or unknowingly pass contraband from security are the best-flying.
Nevertheless, as the firm pointed out, the TSA rules are a bit tricky and confusing.
People are often not sure what fluids or how much they can carry.
So it's not surprising that the largest amount of substance confiscated by the TSA is exposed as prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but international ones are not allowed.

EPA President Pruitt ceases to delay Obama-era emission reduction laws
A day after being sued by 15 states, the President of the Environmental protection organization Scott Pruitt has reconsidered the decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-era law, which lowers the air pollutant emissions that caused the dirty smoke.
Pruitt represented the change with his organization being more responsive to the needs of the state environmental regulators than the past administrations.
He never mentioned a legal objection to his previous position in a Federal Supreme Court.
The states are beginning to meet the end of October 1, which is the expiration of 2015 standards for ground level ozone.
Pruitt announced that he would postpone the compatibility for a year in June to give his organisation more time to work and avoid "interfering with local decisions or preventing economic growth".
Prior to his appointment with President Donald Trump, the state's chief prosecutor in Oklahoma, Pruitt, served as a trusted ally against tighter environmental regulations for a long time.
Since he arrived in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly acted to prevent or delay the regulations against the chemical and fossil fuels industries.
The sudden change on Wednesday is the latest legal defeat for Pruitt's agenda to undo the arrangement.
Last month, a federal Supreme Court in Washington, the EPA administrator, has the limits of its authority to try to delay the application, which is an Obama administration Act, demanding that oil and gas companies control and reduce methane leaks He ruled that he was overcome.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that the return of ozone standards strengthened the EPA's commitment to work only with the provinces and new standards in time and through complex processes.
Pruitt, who sued the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job, said: "Under previous administrations, the EPA will often fail to meet the deadlines of the decisions, waiting to be sued by activist groups and others, and for the decision Agreed to resolve the dispute to set schedules. "
"We do not believe in organizing through litigation, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority he gave us seriously. "
Nevertheless, the EPA's explanation is that Pruitt may use "delaying authority and any legally available authority" at some point to ensure that the arrangements are "backed by robust policies and the best information available". Said.
The Republicans in Congress are pressing for a broader rewrite of the ozone laws.
A parliamentary bill, approved last month, strives to delay the implementation of 2015 laws for at least eight years.
The precaution has not yet been brought to the Senate to vote.
New York chief prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who led the state coalition that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to pursue legal pressure.
"After our cases, the EPA's decision to change is an important achievement for the health and safety of more than 115 million Americans, who are directly affected by the dirty smoke that flows to 6.7 million New yorkers and their communities," said Schneiderman.
The case was attended to new York City in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground level Ozone is created when general pollutants are secreted by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources that react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting dirty smoke can cause serious breathing problems in a group of people who are quickly affected and contributes to thousands of early deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applaud Pruitt's surprise change of decision.
Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biodiversity said: "It is disturbing to have so much pressure to obtain this discreet step from the person who is tasked with protecting the air we breathe."
"We must continue to fight against the ideological struggle of the Trump administration, to pollute the environment and to the interest groups."

Although we have taken measures as our government, ministry and governorship to end these events as soon as possible, we demand that our people's sensitivity to this matter increase.
I'm sorry about yesterday's events on behalf of my hospital and my health care workers.

Let's not carry the fights of the Old World tomorrow
The delayed perception of the realities of the country and the world can lead to crises, not simple people.
One of the reasons why the backward east, which we characterise as "singing", is delayed to perceive the realities of the world, the fact that these truths are prevented by certain focuses on the geography of the east, or that they are announced in a truly transnational way. Can.
Don Quixote and Oblomov have also been subject to the world of literature, to detect or never perceive the facts and changes delayed.
Cervantes ' Don Quixote ' is a meczup who still considers himself a knight in return, when the bourgeoisie begins to form.
Or Gonçarov's "Oblomov" is a lazy heiress who thinks that when he ignores the truth, everything can last as it was before.
Chinese example, China was open to the world by the end of the 15th century, and a country dominated by the seas, a conservative dynasty was closed as a result of the throne.
It lasted until the captains of the boats that came out of China's territorial waters were executed.
One foot, eyes and ears in the west, the other foot, eyes and ears in the east we Turks, starting from the Ottomans, we experienced constant dilemmas to perceive the facts and change.
We tried to move past the old and new department to today, to understand today with concepts that meet the old conditions, and to think about yesterday tomorrow.
In our department, we were able to act as fast as thought focuses in developed countries in order to perceive the realities of the country and the world, as well as change.
This situation has been a source of constant conflict, tensions.
The university with the madrasas, the modern army with Yeninis, the encounters of faith and suspicion, caused a dramatic content of the duet.
Even worse, the progressive and the future of the new and advanced postures in a period, at the end of certain periods of time and will be left behind was not accepted.
Yesterday's progressive after a period of time, the new and advanced "dangerous", the country and the world to interpret the conditions in accordance with the current reality, the employees began to declare "treacherous".
The most important lesson in the Ottoman Empire, the realities of the country and the reality of the thought and state of the world to be dominated by the end of the empires disintegrated, collapsed and the people became poor.
The most important lesson of our Ottoman history to the Republic was the fact that the rapid perception of world conjunctance and change was an inevitable prerequisite for survival.
Since this course is very well absorbed, we have been the example country of this geography, which has managed to preserve its unity, integrity and stability in peace so far from the 1st World War.
In order to survive the global change process entered into a different approach, we need to leave the memorization behind and behave in harmony with the facts.
In other words, no one will come to anyone to carry out the meaningless campgrounds and blood feudities that have caused the likening of our democracy in the past.
Moreover, the smallest mistakes in today's world lead to huge and dramatic crises.
The most problematic geography in this regard is the Middle East.

Moore's Ford massacre: Activists reinvigored racist lynching to call for justice
A 1948 model Ford Mercury was passed through a group of viewers in the Monroe Georgia countryside, and the little Ford Bridge in Moore moved forward.
A car with four black passengers and a white driver came forward to cover a group of armed white men before reaching the bridge.
The leader of the gang, a man in the middle-aged thin striped suit, took a long breath from his cigar and looked carefully through the windshield.
Inside, the residents were terrified.
"We want that Z..... I, Roger!" he barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
When a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat, the screams went through the darkness.
Fortunately, this horrifying scene played on June 22nd is just a reenactment.
But when a noose was thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone from the audience breathsfully in a very realistic way.
Since 2005, human rights activists have been returning to the Ford Bridge in Moore to revive the two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) being lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far no one has ever been accused of murder.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organise the reinvigorate, said: "Even if we see them in our societies, we know who they are, but they don't think that one person has been arrested for all these years."
"A stain on this date, but a burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old congressional member of the Georgia state and a lifelong human rights advocate.
For him, this reenactment is a call to dramatic action and a yearly reminder that an injustice to Monroe society has never been corrected.
He said: "We want to prosecute, we want results, we want to hug the wounds, we want to compromise, but first we have to get justice."
"We can't have it until we get justice for the wound hug and reconciliation."
On July 27, 1946, the coroner put a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Ford Linc in Moore.
According to the FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding areas have suspected links.
But not one of them has ever been investigated.
Although the suspects remain fugitives for decades, human rights advocates say that the twin motivations of the lynching are always well known throughout the town: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling made it possible for the first time black citizens in Georgia to vote in the pre-election at the end of that summer.
According to the FBI, nearly the same time as the black joint-venture Roger Malcom, a white landowner, Barnett Hester, who apparently stabbed a woman in a fight.
Brooks; The rumor in town is that Hester was sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not from her own husband.
According to the FBI, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner on July 25, 1946, paid $600 to remove Malcom from prison.
Dorothy and her cousins went to jail in the escort of Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove away from prison to the Ford bridge in Moore, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
An FBI report concludes that Harrison was the one who set the murders and ordered the killings.
"It was also clear that there was a secret agreement between the state and local law enforcement authorities that they were not only involved in the murder, they destroyed the evidence and hid the identities of the witnesses."
Brooks said it was shorter and more self-described.
He said, "That was the massacre of voting rights."
"They were all killed to send a message to the black people in this society: ' If you register and vote, this is what will happen to you. '"
For almost ten years, Cassandra Greene has been directing the reanimation of the Ford Bridge lynching at Moore's every year.
His performance is based on all the details, remarkable, and a deep race of racism, where many believe that they no longer exist in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to turn your gaze, but Greene says it's the goal.
He said, "We don't want to talk about lynching, because that's what makes all of our faces ugly."
"But if you don't listen to me or listen to what's happening to me, I can't develop a relationship with you."
The rehearsals of this year's construction began in June, and the first day, close to 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest black) were filled into a room, and Greene listened to the game's well-rehearsed general lines with a request.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's assistant director.
Over the years, the president has played the role of Klansman, but he says the role never gets easier.
Marbaugh said: "I feel dirty because it's not me."
"But I think it's important to keep this past alive because we don't want to go back to that time."
Throughout the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, were rehearsing their own lines.
The game begins when Malcom yells at Hester, who is furious that his wife is sleeping with Dorothy.
"Z.... I said, get off my Property!"
Rascona responds.
There's a shooting sound.
And then everyone (at least the black actors) is drowning in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
Rascona asked, "What?!"
He was agited, surprised.
Was I too harsh?
Greene said "No" in the chutes.
"I just don't think white people are saying" Z... "
One of the black players threw a rock with a joke saying "yes."
"You must suppress the R."
So the energy in the room changes, and some kind of intimacy takes the place of restlessness.
Everyone is dedicated to doing it right, not just for the sake of the game, but also for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene starts again.
This time it says the word starting with the Rascona N, sharp and accentuated.
Absolutely no one laughs.
Reanimation ends violently and quickly.
Screams, gunfire, and then silence.
A woman dressed as a funeral black, standing on the bodies of actors and reading "weird Fruit" by Billie Holiday's sad eulogy.
He's breaking his voice in either word.
A hundred yards back, an average of four dozen spectators are wiping their tears and sweat from their eyes.
The audience is almost equally divided into black and white.
A couple came from the Ithaca, New York to see the performance, most of them on the road.
While Brooks took them on a sacred journey to the Malcom and the Dorsey cemeteries, they were all based on Georgia's repressive moisture for almost eight hours.
Up to this point, the murders were an anecdote, but now it's the same place where the Lynch is, it means the weather is cursed.
While the last notes of the song are weakening, Greene invites the crowd to zoom in and examine the bodies.
The children are crouching on their hands, grasping fake blood and motionless bodies and whispering to each other.
A little boy muttering like he reminds himself, "they're not really dead."
A few minutes later, Greene thanks the crowd and it's all over.
The actors throw the lynching and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw yellows to Marbaugh, the suit that plays President Klansman.
Nick Rascona Yellows Two of his fellow players and tears in their arms, and the emotional cost of performance comes to him at the end.
One of the women whispers, "no problem."
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did it for a reason. "
Then the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
A white couple from Atlanta at a table is having a heated conversation about reanimation with a black couple.
Denise Duplinski has trouble finding words about how the performance feels to her.
He said: "These horrible, terrible words, and those behaviors... come out of people who look like you and they do it because they resemble you."
"What this has done to me is that the lynching is still going on," he added, "They are now only called police armed attacks."
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks eats at the table and tells the human rights Memoirs of the limelight.
He said he's already planning next year's performance.
He said, "reanimation is kind of inspiring because it describes what we're putting up with, but it's also a tutorial."
"Like, if you don't learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who do not investigate their past, who do not know their past, are doomed to repeat it. "

Metin 2 took him to his death again!
According to the first report by the Forensic Medicine Agency, Hakan's preliminary autopsy report revealed that his death was suicide.
In the detailed examination, there were no signs of any contraindications or algebra in the child's body.
The reason for the suicide is the breathing of the elastic bandage around his neck.
The gland, which the family has indicated as a bandage, is also determined to be the elastic bandage used in the wounds.
Newspaper Habertürk'ın Muslim Sarıyar reported that after the preparation of the detailed report on the death of the child, stating that the incident was suicide in the investigation of the report of the Büyükçekmece Republican prosecutor's office "learned to be sent.
The police are investigating the child's suicide in full detail, and after the incident, the investigations on the confiscated computer are also in progress.
Hakan "Friends of the police said they would refer to the statement.
The information to be obtained from the computer of Hakan ", which is called" cleansed "of relatives, can be reached by third parties or a gang.
The police are evaluating Hakan as a gang that could have dragged the suicide.
The certainty that Hakan's suicide has turned into a violent Metin2 ".
Response to the grounds of addiction and violence in children, which was banned by the governor of Antalya last year under 15 years Metin2, 2009 "also 13-year-old" tiny hacker "Metin Kang" came up with the killing.
2005 in order to play Metin2, which is designed in Korea, you need to login and register.
Players are trying to provide peace and justice in the World with the Dragon God in the game.
There are wars going on, the dose of violence is increasing.
In the game, the lines, swords, machetes, axe-like cutters, battle images made with piercing weapons, as well as people are torn by the wild animals are eaten by the images of flesh.
The player buys characters with money to get stronger.
Esenyurt Istiklal Mahallesi Köknar Street at home after the incident on July 25, the next day, the family buried their children continued to claim the murder.
Father Mehmet Ekinci, "The whole dream was to become a doctor, because the game does not think it can hurt itself or anyone else," he said: "Wrapped in the neck, and tied the elastic bandage to the side of the knot."
That's how it was found, son.
We certainly don't think our son could hurt himself or anyone else over the internet because of a game, or that he could commit suicide.
We knew he was playing a game like this.
It wasn't a game he was playing with.
Let's just say he gets a little bored and quits the game.
If the mother Gülizar Ekinci, "entering into the building-no coming out."
It's said that my child entered the house at a certain time.
None of them are holding each other.
There was only one chair when his brother came home.
"But when the funeral was found there were two chairs next to the computer," he said.
Ilker Karaş: May be infected with the gang
Parents don't pay attention to this issue in general.
They look at it as if my child is home and what's happening.
The child communicates with many people through games.
There may have been a borrowing situation, or abusive.
Or he invited someone in the game to the House, and it might have been a problem between them.
It may have had an impact because of problems with other people who were communicating through the game, not directly from the game.
The image of the game, the fiction, the child may have thought to be true.
Trauma to suicide could be about blackmail.
If the child is faced with a complaint to the family, there is also a situation of depression that could not solve the problem.
He couldn't have committed suicide because of the game himself.
There's a chance the kid might be involved in the gang.
He may have been involved in the gang.
There's nothing a child could have done alone.
Information Systems Consultant Füsun Nebil: Families should know the interaction of their children
We can't say games are harmful.
The research also says that games are useful for children's development.
What is important here is that parents pay attention to what their children are playing and how they are talking to players online.
Families should know what content the children are affected by and take precautions.
There are only 2 children in Turkey in 5 years, said to have died from the game.
This shows that the end of a child's life is not just the effect of the games.
I wonder what pushed this kid into this.
We need to find out first.
You need to look at sociology and psychology around the kid.
8-month return in Borsa Istanbul based on 50 percent
The BIST 100 index continued its upward trend in July 2016 and moved its ascension to the 8th month on top.
Thus, the index gained 45.3 per cent during the first time since July 2007, when it was 8 months in a row.
The Bıst 100 index, which has shown its performance since the beginning of the year, including Germany, the United States, Britain, Japan and the world's major stock exchanges, did not leave the leadership on the basis of returns in July.
7.06 per cent of the month of July, the Mustache 100 index, 2.54 percent increase in the U.S. Dow Jones index, 0.81 percent in the UK with the FTSE 100 index followed.
With the DAX index in Japan, the Nikkei index was completed in July with a loss of value.
As of January-July, the Bıst 100 index showed a high performance from both the major world stock exchanges and the emerging country stock exchanges.
This year 2016 percent of 37.6 per cent of the winning mustache 100 Index, the Dow Jones index with an increase of 10.76 percent, the DAX index with a value gain of 5.55 percent, the Nikkei index with a rise of 4.55 percent, with an increase of 3.21 percent of the FTSE 100 index followed.
The indicator Mscı EM index, which is indicative of the emerging country stock exchanges, provided a 23% return.
Looking at the historical process of the Bıst 100 index showed similar performances in the past.
The last of the 8 months between December 2006 and July 2007 by gaining value in a row of the Moustache 100 index in this period was a 38.3 percent increase.
In addition, the Bıst 100 index was completed by gaining value between August 1996 and March 1997 in the 9 months between May 1997 and January 1998.
Meksa Investment Research Manager Eren Can, AA correspondent, said that the 100 index of the mustache continues to rise for 8 months, since the beginning of the year has exceeded the level of 37 percent of the rise.
It noted that the Mscı Emerging Markets (EM) index had increased by 23 per cent, with positive decomposition even when we looked at these ratios, noting the following:
The flow of funds to developing countries continues since the beginning of the year.
Especially the funds in the pursuit of high returns prefer countries that give higher interest.
In this situation, domestic markets are affected in a positive way.
Of course, the appetite for risk on a global scale is quite high.
In this way, stock indices in the status of risky assets are in vogue.
In the United States, the S&P 500 index has been tested for new record levels almost every week, parallel to an increase of nearly 11 percent since the beginning of the year.
At the beginning of the year, the US Central (Fed) 3 interest increase in the estimation of the markets stressed, but the Fed's oral orientation policy is eliminated uncertainty by using quite well, the Fed's interest increase in an insensitive market .
He said inflation in the United States is not yet at the desired level, and that the Fed will not be hasty in the interest increase and that the expectations for avoiding radical moves are very effective in current pricing.
U.S. President Donald Trump's inability to cancel health reform, known as "Obamacare", has strengthened its perception that it cannot fulfill its promises of expanding fiscal policies, "although the U.S. grows faster thanks to Trump Although the expectations of the economy affect the stock markets one semester, the failure to fulfill promises will be given faster growth and faster inflation, and in this context the market strengthens the hand of the Fed. " Said.
He said that in terms of Turkey's markets, 2016 is a year of many negativity, noting that negative differentiation and oversold Bıst 100 index are in an effort to close the gap, according to similar.
A strong recovery from domestic source of news, the current view, the increase in the appetite for risk taking more than the domestic market, according to the similar to the request to close the gap in the form of triggering can be interpreted.
He, technically, 108,600 levels with the new records tested in the 100 index of a certain amount of profits in the sales stated that the following said:
Especially the 109.500-110,000 region is a critical threshold in the short term.
Profit sales are normal after approaching these levels.
In the short term, we think a new local or global story should be formed for prices over 110,000.
For now, crossing down 107,500 support may trigger profit sales.
In this case, although we follow the 107,000 support, I think it may be seen to unwind until the 106.000-105.500 region.
In particular, the breakage of 105,500 support can bring the withdrawal up to 104,300 level, which corresponds to 50 percent of Fibo on the rise from 100,000 to 108,600 levels.
The decision of both the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) will be at the focal point of the global market, it is clear that the expectations for the Fed are already evident, but the balance reduction programme is not expected to increase the interest in September FOMC. He said it could trigger the U.S. dollar empowerment.
This situation could trigger profit sales in the developing country (Goü) stock indices in the short-term overhaul, stating that "what is important is what the ECB will say."
After the July Monetary policy board meeting, ECB president Mario Draghi voiced their appreciation for the course of monetary policy in autumn, making the euro/dollar parity rise above 1.1700 levels.
Therefore, the explanations for the reduction or termination of the monthly 60 billion-euro asset acquisition programme will mean that the ECB will reduce post-Fed liquidity on a global scale.
"Therefore, negative prices may lead to the name of the country's markets, which give a high current account deficit and access to the foreign fund." .
Gedik Investment investment consultancy manager Erol Gürcan said that in November 2016, after the election of Trump's president in the United States, a very serious rally was experienced in terms of global stock markets.
Gürcan said that the key element that triggered this rally movement is that it is possible to say that Trump is a development that increases the expectations of global growth, particularly the promises of tax reductions, noting:
Borsa Istanbul was the leading stock exchanges in the global rally.
One of the most important reasons for this is that the Bıst 100 index has remained relatively discounted in recent years compared to similar developing country markets, but the steps to support the economy and financial markets by policymakers Also played a serious role.
In particular, we can say that the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF), which became active in March, has a serious impact on the rise so far in the index.
The rest of the year, positive developments reflected in the significant pricing, and this is a significant role in the rise kgf also gradually reached the saturate Gürcan, Bıst 100 index is still discounted compared to similar country markets Although it remains to remain, the quest for a new story for the rest of the year can gradually come to the fore.
Gürcan especially for a while to share the details of the expected 180 daily action plan, increasing the limit of the credit guarantee Fund, as well as supporting the company's profits to make arrangements, a possible tax deduction that comes up in the recent period Such developments can make a positive contribution in this sense, he noted.
As Gürcan, the Fed, ECB and central Bank of England (BoE), as well as important advanced country central banks to gradually tighten up existing expanding monetary policy posture, also the critical risk factors for developing countries Emphasising that, "the Fed has been continuing to increase its moderate interest for some time and will likely initiate the balance reduction process after September, and the probability that the ECB would terminate the asset acquisition programme in the near period and the Fed's In this sense, the probability of being one of the major developed country central banks that will increase interest will be the main developments to be followed ".
In the upcoming period of possible correction movements in the index, the upward trend seen since the beginning of the year 200, which corresponds to the moving average of the 104.150-104.600 support zone is very critical Gürcan, this support zone In the event of breakage, the correction transaction could continue to 101,700, 100,000, 99,200 levels, respectively.
Gürcan, protecting the current upward trend and the current historical summit level 108,605 resistance in the case of breakage of the index can rise up to 110,000-112.000 range, he said.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO killed in military suicide attack
According to officials, a suicide bomber in the Afghan capital, Kabul, attacked a military convoy, killed a NATO soldier, and wounded a few.
The NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
Unconfirmed local sources say three civilians died in the city's Karabakh region.
The bombing is the last violent act in Afghanistan this month; On Tuesday, more than 30 people died in a mosque explosion in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO statement, Thursday night's explosion in joint patrol with the Afghan Army ' personnel-guided hand-crafted explosive ' was attacked with.
The statement said all injuries were in good condition and were treated at the US military Hospital at Bagram Air Base.
Reporters say the rising power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State in Karabakh are a major concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, Afghanistan witnessed the deaths of at least 1662 civilians, with an average of 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb in Kabul's mostly Shiite region killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On 31 May, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people in the country's deadliest militant attack after the US-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The act of violence stresses the unstable security situation in Afghanistan, while US president Donald Trump weighs on whether to increase the number of U.S. troops helping the country and the military.
In recent weeks, the reporters say that the suicide bombings in Kabul have led to the government, his policies, and especially the crisis of public confidence in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA ceases to delay dirty air rule after lawsuits
The US Environmental protection organization returned from a decision to delay the law, which is an Obama-era law, which demanded that the provinces prevent the emissions of dirty smoke, and the organization of the 15 provinces after a day sued on this initiative.
The EPA announced its decision to continue with "2015 ozone resolutions", saying it showed the organisation's commitment to work with the provinces late Wednesday.
"We believe in dialogue and being sensitive to our state partners," said EPA chief Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention to delay the EPA's ozone decisions by one year until October 2018; With these decisions, the current dirty smoke pollution is measured in various parts of the country, and it is decided where the interruption is required to meet more stringent air quality standards.
The 15 states, mostly Democrat, and the district of Columbia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday saying that this effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been seeking to undo a wide range of environmental regulations that have been implemented by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump said to revive economic growth.
But these efforts have led to the reaction of the protective groups concerned about the effects of Democrats and more emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says that breathing air can "reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma".
The forest gave the gospel...

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, they're negotiating a possible competition.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who will cross paths to exhibit the most satisfying boxing match in the near future for the 147 pound six, met with each other on Thursday.
The Invincible World Boxing Council light weight champion Garcia was in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until he walked down the aisle and greeted the world Boxing Organization super featherweight champion Lomachenko.
On Saturday, in Showtime, the four-cycle former world champion Adrien Broner, after Garcia's defeat, both fighters are among the top five members of the heavyweight list.
Garcia handed out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck with that. "
Lomachenko will defend his belt on ESPN on Saturday night at 7:00 against Miguel Marriaga.
While posing for photos, the duo, Lomochenko's manager Egis Klimar, noted that a potential competition between fighters would be "the perfect size".
Garcia made a reminder of "I'm an old feather."
"I went high for Broner (140 Pounda) but I'm not that big.
Little for 140.
I want to go down on the light cycle.
He should go for the light cycle (135 pounds), then we can fight.
That's what fans want.
Let's give them this. "
Lomachenko attended.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked whether it should be ' pay and watch '; Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout) is part of his strategy to set a date for the next summer and fight Lomachenko in an opening match of 135 pounds this year; Garcia is also interested in fighting the winner of the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell match for his lightweight title on the Forum on September 23rd.
Garcia said, "fight can be paid and watch because all the fans want it," and later stated that the channel is open to it if it offers the best financial package.
We're the main names.
No other name creates such an interest.
When they are ready... "
Garcia says he appreciates Lomachenko as a "great fighter" and can join his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko hesitated to give Garcia a lot of praise and said that the three-cycle champion from Riverside thought it looked "too slow," "Sorry, Mikey... you wanted the knockout."
Garcia said that the focus was to show fist strength and then boxing.
Both said they felt the momentum was created for their own encounters.
"This is a fight that needs to be done.
Another fight doesn't create so much interest and rumors.
Garcia said, "I'm so happy to be dealing with this."
Lomachenko said: "I waited for the best fighters and he was Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight. "
Turkish rest from Russia to America
The White House does not intend to impose sanctions on Moscow's pipeline construction, but sanctions against Russia can increase the cost of these lines.
This is because the cost of borrowing is increased.
Concerned that Western investment partners would consider withdrawal from the projects because of sanctions, the Kremlin has accelerated the construction of pipelines in response.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which has built the Turkish current line, which is planned to reach Turkey under the Black Sea, has accelerated construction at the request of Gazprom.
Reuters wrote that Gazprom began construction of a second pipeline parallel to the Turkish Stream "hurried" in order to export more gas to Europe.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment test announced
The latest results of the evaluation tests of refugees subjected to a new medical age assessment in Sweden ruled that more than 80 per cent of the participants in the test were over 18 years old, but not everyone is confident about the accuracy of these tests.
Sweden's national forensic Medicine and Drug Administration (Rättsmedicinalverket) began to make the tests earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make the age assessment more accurate in the asylum process after criticism of the failure of the Swedish Immigration Agency (Migrationsverket) to evaluate the correct age of some refugees who claim to be minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the test, and the forensic and pharmaceutical agency has now announced the outcome of the tests from mid-March until 31 July 2017, totaling 2481 of them.
80 percent (2002) were ruled to be 18 or above, and in 25 cases, the forensic Medicine and Drug Administration ruled that the subject was "probably 18 and over".
The outcome of the 432 case was that the person was "probably under 18".
The tests were only made in cases where the person's age was suspected.
According to Johan Göransson of the Department of Forensic Medicine and medicine, the results are consistent with the past months.
"We do not see a big difference in statistics compared to the past months, the numbers are quite consistent," the Local said.
The proportion of cases dominated by the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that the refugees are lying about their ages.
In May, the apartment announced the outcome of the 581 test and said that "the people surveyed are 18 years or older" and 442 status.
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of the 581 case, he found that the 243 case clearly declared that he was 18 years old.
The medical Age assessment method, which includes X-rays of 20-year-old teeth and screening of knee joints, and then analysed them to dentists and radiologists, is criticized in some circles.
One of the skepticism is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, which evaluates the biological maturity of people who have studies on whether the age of puberty is earlier than normal or late entry.
"I have reason to think about it, and I think it should not be the type of measurement used.
It's very doubtful to decide this way of biological age.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend to be, "said the Metro.
But he argued that Göransson tests from the Department of Forensic Medicine and Medicine said: "In general, the risk of a child being ruled incorrectly as an adult might be small.
The biggest risk is that the person is under the age of 18, in which case the risk is around 10 percent. "

Coach, you've improved your attitude.
And then they called, but you didn't go once.
Some think you chose Turkey for money.
What are you saying?
The last thing I remember about Cuba is that I left the national team.
From that moment on, I have a line on what I've been through.
Then I came to Turkey with the invitation of Fenerbahçe Club.
The initiative of the national team was also thanks to Fenerbahce.
They offered me an offer for reinforcements.
I opened a new page with Turkey.
I had a lot of disability in my youth, but after the opportunities offered to me in Turkey, I scored significant achievements in Rio and Amsterdam.
I can't wait to make the best of the world athletics Championships and win a different title.
You cried at a press conference recently.
Can you tell us why?
When Turkey is directed to a question about the emergence of me; I come to my childhood, I get expelled from the Cuban national team at age 23.
And of course, people in Turkey approach me.
When I won the gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam, I felt similar things when the Istiklal anthem was played.
I couldn't hold my tears.
I thank Turkey very much for the opportunity to fulfill my dreams.
I am very happy to belong to the Turkish national team.
I'll be here until my legs run.

Turkish women cook very well, but my boyfriend makes it better.
Laughing) Dried beans-Rice is my first choice.
I just laughed at him.
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He took other teenagers to my place.
After winning medals for Turkey, we met in Cuba.
He showed me to the young athletes next to me, and he said, "Look, I raised him."
I just laughed at him.
My glasses are my test
The curiosity of the glasses you wear in the races...
I'm just using it for concentration.
As soon as I wear the glasses, I cut off my relationship with the world and put a wall on both sides.
I'm just focusing on the finish line and I don't see anything else.

Coe praised Russia's ' sincere ' apology for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the boss of global Athletics, praised Russia's sincere apology for the doping scandal, but stressed that the time is not right for the country to be re-admitted to sports.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin, the World Championships on Athletics on the eve of the IAF Congress, the country is correct to be banned from sports, and he said he is determined to fight with doping.
"In competitions, gold and silver medals were taken from all athletes who were forced from them" said he apologized.
Despite his assessment, the IAAF Congress voted to continue the ban after the world Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report in November 2015 found evidence of state-sponsored dopinge in Russia.
"I think today is a very intimate response, a very intimate presentation," said AAF chief Coe correspondents.
"The entire council was pleased and the entire Congress... The fact that the Russian Federation has adopted itself, has survived many turbulent days and has done everything possible to ensure the restructuring of the Federation... "
He also said Russia is "satisfied" that he has accepted the acceptance criteria again.
"I think it's a very constructive day, and I think it's a road, but Congress supports the recommendation that the Task Force is not the right time to return the rights of Russia," Coe said.
"In the next few months, we must do everything to normalize this situation.
Our guiding principle has always been to ask to separate clean athletes from the defective system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict IAAF criteria will be competing at the World Athletics Championships in London, which will begin on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF task Force, said on Monday that Russia did not meet many criteria for restitution of its rights.
After a presentation in London to the IAAF council, reporters said that the drug test was still insufficient and that banned coaches still worked freely.

Asia's share from 2 percent to 7-8 percent.
Russia's share has risen.
While we were trying to do that, the Gulf states had some problems among themselves.
Turkey has good relations with all of them; Especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar are two major actors.
But the problem between the two countries is upsetting us and it allows investors to postpone their decisions a little more.
We may be experiencing some delays, not just in terms of investments in Turkey.
Arda Ermut, last week, there were some incidents about Germany, but the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reminded that the situation clearly and precisely reacted.
When they talk to investors of countries experiencing the harshest political crisis, President Erdogan's reaction, "see, the problems happen between the governments, certainly not among the peoples."
Secondly, these people have come to invest in my country.
This is no different from the Turkish companies for us.
On the contrary, they'll come to us when they have the slightest problem, we'll figure it out.
"We certainly won't let them be victims." In the form of voicing Ermut, they continue to support all investors with the comfort of them expressed.
Ermut, "We can reassure this in the coming period."
You will see that neither the German companies nor the investors from the countries where we have some political problems in any way are going to have a problem.
On the contrary, I hope we will do our best to increase the investments that come from these countries.
We believe that the investments coming from here will continue to increase.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions about the investment environment.
"But at this point, we do our part and we will do our best to the goal of our investors not to be affected by the perception of the investment environment." .
TYDTA president Ermut, after the single-generation single-path strategy, Turkey began to see great interest in China, but if the problems in the Gulf resolved the biggest investment in the Gulf said they expect.
"In relations with Germany, ' we had a problem because of these relationships, we had investments because of this incident, we are escaping, ' there is not even one investor who says". Using the statements, Ermut, incoming, coming and followed by the companies noted that.
"At the moment, about 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies."
So, almost 10 percent of the companies we meet from all over the world consist of German companies.
Some of these companies are already investing in Turkey.
He's going to raise his investment or something, and we're open as a project.
"Therefore, German companies are actually still a significant part of our daily workflow". He said.
Emphasising that all State institutions should be careful during the periods of perception operations to Turkey, Ermut said the issue was sensitive and could be affected in the slightest bad communication.
Ermut, the last 2-3 week, stating that what was a good lesson, explained the following:
The agenda of investors and politicians is always different.
We've always seen this. Economic relations always make political developments a kind of way.
Germany will remain an important trading partner and an important investor.
Because they already have a lot of investments in Turkey.
Unfortunately, the election agenda in Germany is also increasing this kind of rhetoric.
I think that when they pass, they'll be a little bit more in the way.
In Saudi Arabia's special, the two countries are paying attention not to make negative statements.
Ultimately, an investor investing in Turkey is targeting all the environmental markets.
Therefore, it was not due to Saudi Arabia but there were some slow processes due to uncertainty in the region.
But we're still negotiating with these investors.
My personal opinion is that investors are now holding a decision that they may take faster.
' I see uncertainty because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia in a negative sense, I'm getting out of here, ' says Saudi investors.
On the contrary, we still have Saudi investors who continue to live in Turkey, we follow all the processes while we are making their holiday here.
Arda Ermut, the International Direct investments (Udy) that came to Turkey last year 12.3 billion dollars, reminding, "I think we will definitely pass him this year.
"But as far as we are going, these regional developments will affect global uncertainty." Said.
Normally, while hoping that the multiplier effect will be more, perhaps a little more limited, indicating that Ermut, the first 5 months of an increase of 11 percent, pointed out that it can be protected, "I hope that without a bad development, I do or I believe this year's end will definitely be better off than last year. " .
Ermut, which points out that an important part of the investments will continue to be real estate, logistics, health, fintech, informatics, petro-chemistry, food, energy and manufacturing in the field of new investments gave the information can be seen.
Stressing that there will be new investments to announce in the coming months, Ermut said, "We may have an investment announcement recently in terms of manufacturing."
Not a billion dollars, but a big investment.
"There may be investments in interesting countries." .

How will the financial rules of football affect Neymar's departure to Paris?
The rules for preventing unlimited spending of European football clubs will not prevent Neymar's transfer of world records from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
The power of the prestigious Champions League tournament, which controls the European game, the management unit from UEFA to Paris Saint-Germain can result in all sorts of results.
The Financial fair Game rules issued by UEFA in 2011 mean that the PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was financed without enormous losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros (262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of the contract, and Neymar will dominate a salary worth tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's departure to France:
Given the benefit from the energy-rich family of the team, PSG will be able to sign Neymar and, of course, pay the money to add it to the other galaxy of stars.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to buy players, but they also have to balance it with legitimate sources of income, provided they get to deal with their football-related work.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after being elected UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that had been in pursuit of success were actively fraud and were at risk of bankruptcy if banks or owners pulled their support.
In 2011, FFP began to monitor the losses instead of focusing on the debts of the clubs.
The change meant that the model Roman Abramovic first used in Chelsea in 2003 (Buy a club with potential, make a high expenditure to improve the team and create a global brand) becomes a more difficult attempt.
During the 3-year FFP evaluation period, which continues until 2018, clubs can incur a loss of 30m euros.
Although Platini was expelled from the presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, is still committed to giving up overspending.
Andrea Traverso, who manages the FFP in UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: "FFP is definitely not dead and we will surely strengthen the rules by moving forward."
Although PSG will pay a mass purchase of Neymar's purchasing item, it may spread the amount to the contract period for accounting reasons.
Neymar signed a 5-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a cost of 44.4 euros in the annual accounts of the next 5 years.
The first wave of FFP in 2014 saw the implementation of the heaviest sanctions on Manchester City, owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
The PSG was then sentenced to 60 million euros (then 82 million), which was reduced to 20 euros, and was ordered to limit the Champions League team to 21 players, normally instead of 25, for the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA will inflate its revenues through companies connected to the owners of the club, and to the clubs that can try to deceive financial regulators.
Although a catered company can sponsor PSG, if the value of sponsorship exceeds the standard market values, UEFA will not allow it to be counted as a justified income.
In UEFA 2014, this was the case when Qatar's tourism authority ruled that PSG sponsorship was inflated.
A portion of Neymar's earnings from PSG reportedly could come through the payments of Qatar's 2022 World Cup organising committee.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become the World Cup envoy, and such a move can be easily revealed by the UEFA regulators.
The past sanctions on PSG mean that UEFA will be more careful against attempts to overcome the rules.
According to the subject of the foundations of the talks on Tuesday, UEFA, Neymar's transfer is not a preventive meeting with PSG.
They spoke to the Associated Press on condition that they remain confidential, as they are not authorised to discuss the status of PSG.
Recent accounts show that PSG has more than 10m euros in revenues of 542.4 million euros in 2015-16.
The accounts of the last fiscal year are not yet published.
The PSG expects Neymar's arrival to contribute to sponsorship agreements, gift and form sales.
The club expects the turnover to increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
Openly disturbed by the departure of one of the greatest players in football, the Spanish league tried to prevent Neymar's departure for allegedly violating PSG's FFP.
La Liga President Javier Tebas Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the exact owner of the PSG of Qatar, "This is an open ' financial doping ' case with the club and its state," he said.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who belongs to an American sports giant in his club, shares his concerns about the state funding of La Liga.
"This is a result of ownership and has completely changed the entire ground of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country has a hut, anything is possible.
It's hard to respect financial Fair Play because for a country such a big player to represent a country can have different methods or different interests.
Insurers ' ceiling price ' rebellion
According to TSB data, the insurance sector has been damaging to the traffic branch since 2006.
The sector, which 2.35 billion TL in 2015, has achieved only 19 million TL profit in 2016.
Aksigorta, Anadolu insurance and solar insurance are trading in Borsa Istanbul.
Speaking at the meeting, which evaluated the first six-month results of the TSB 2017, Çağlar, the 11-year losses in traffic insurance reached TL 7.3 billion, the damage of the sector with the ceiling premium application this year 2.3 billion, estimated damage-premium rate He said they predicted it would be 125 percent.
This year, the 2015 figure will be captured in the ages, 2012 and 2015, noting that the loss of other branches in the profits of the losses, "this means that; We raise the price of the citizen's housing policy by financing the bad driver. "
"75 per cent of the sector is foreign, and our partners abroad are financing the bad driver in a sense," he said.
Çağlar, continued as follows:
We don't expect a profit from traffic, but when we look at the past 11 years, we can't show any profits.
"We accept that, but we continue to hope that we can carry the damage in a reasonable environment with other policies," he said.
While the loss of traffic in the other products to the profitability of the dramatic price increases, said Çağlar, "in 2012, there was a price increase of about 30 percent in car insurance, nearly doubled in 2015, the biggest in our history Damage. "
"Even in an environment where prices increased so much, our profits in traffic at the end of 2016 was only 19 million TL," he said.
Çağlar said they expect to be passed the free tariff next year, "we will lower the price of the good driver at free tariffs and apply high price to the bad driver."
"But the Treasury is looking at the general trend, when the last word on the Treasury," he said.
Undersecretariat of Treasury, since 2015, the rise of compulsory traffic insurance premiums affecting a large part of the society, stating that the maximum premium (ceiling price) has been passed on 12 April.
Accordingly, each group of vehicles relating to mandatory traffic insurance policies, the maximum premiums on mandatory traffic insurances on the basis of provincial groups determined by the number of steps and traffic intensity and accident statistics in mind Identified.
On the other hand, as of July, the "risky insurances pool" application was implemented for high-frequency damage or vehicle groups in compulsory traffic insurance.
Premium and damage to the traffic insurance policies under the pool will be shared between the insurance companies.
The premium of these insured will be determined by the undersecretariat of the Treasury.
Çağlar, with the application of ceiling premiums in traffic in the first 6 months of 2017, the premium production decreased by 11.5 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, the number of policies increased by 4.9 percent to 8.6 million, the traffic, given the inflation About 30% of the discount on their policies.
This year, the traffic again will take the profits of other branches, said Çağlar, "this ceiling prices can not sustain this damage.
How much more can this damage the sector carry? "he said.
The capital of all companies in the sector is 9 billion TL, only 2.3 billion TL traffic is damaged in three years, said the capital of the sector will be finished, "foreigners ' why the good driver is financing the bad driver, why my My thousands of shareholders are financing the bad driver in Turkey? "
"At this point we are trying to tell the Treasury our problem," he said.
After these developments, a question about whether foreigners come to the point of weight reduction in the Turkish insurance sector, the ages, "they have not yet come to that point."
They expect to invest more in Turkey because the average of 6 policies per capita in the Netherlands is 1.3 in Turkey.
"Therefore, Turkey is a place that needs to be truly twisted," he said, and continued as follows:
So they didn't give up.
However, although the company is achieving reasonable profitability every year, it is using it to grow the company by leaving all profits within it.
According to TSB data, in 2016, the premium production in the sector was 40.5 billion, while the first half of this year increased by 12 percent compared to the same period last year as 23.1 billion TL.
Çağlar predicted that the sector will not complete the year with a 15 percent growth in total premium production, he said.

Nostalgia, "Wet Hot American Writing" and "Comrade Detective" is becoming a niche with
As such, for the brilliant days of the characters in the 80s, for the grunge period in the ' 90s (when brains like David Wain and Michael Showalter were a skit comedy "The State" for MTV) and for the year 2001, the Stars were Elizabeth Banks, Amy Before Poehler and Paul Rudd continue with bigger things, this version of the story is nostalgic for all.
As a cultural product, this is both the tacks and the realisation of our perpetual-remembered Facebook era.
But as a series, it's like it's expired.
"The first day of the camp" was unexpectedly successful and it was not only due to absurd humor (in which there was a story about the origins of a talking box plant, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin.)
Focusing on the funniest thing (middle-aged actors playing the underage children of minors) has made it impossible to re-capture the past part of the joke.
The parody is more random, including the monologue about the perverted stalker movie "Ten years Later", where adults play adults and are less emotionally resistant and the 90 's "cradle Shaking Hand".
The character at a point; It mixes an Apple PowerBook with some single-row roller skates and "a lot of other things from 1991".
Many of the main stories are the same.
The soft-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter) is now a writer, still not forgetting Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
In addition, there is another wildly treacherous plan involving Ronald Reagan (Mr. Showalter), who has now been decommissioned by George H. W. Bush (a very well-seated imitation by Michael Ian Black).
As usual, the best part of the series is the search words.
It's very nice to see the young Mr. Rudd, who has always had Matt Dillon's lip-beard on "singles", which is the most popular kid in the old school, Andy, who now looks like an old fart.
There may be moments of random madness that give power to this series (for example, some kind of repeating "Seven up!" series) until I reach what I think is the logical consequence: "Wet Hot American Writing: Twenty years later" That's the last scene of the friend crew "wet Hot American Writing "is guaranteed to go to see the premiere of the film.
Meanwhile, the Amazon "Comrade Detective" appeals to a different type of nostalgia: "The Americans", the Cold War Resurrection, the film "The Blond Bomb" and even the east, the iconography against Western wrestling "GLOW".
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy, directed by Rhys Thomas, looks like a recorded TV: a 1980s Romanian police friends drama that two Bucharest police officers fought for the real, atheism and Marxist-Leninist road.
The lead roller is played by Kurt Gregor and Idealist Iosef, Florin piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, the English dubbing of their dialogues by Channing Tatum (as well as the lead producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some pretty visual comics (Americans watch football while the cops spend time watching chess on TV)
The famous voiceover artist staff, among which are Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny; "The voice is a good material for the know-how" game.
But "Comrade Detective" is so devoted to the fact that a clumsy propaganda drama is so self-involved (including a killer who wears a Reagan mask), mostly playing just like him.
The six long chapters do not know how to pass, and the comedy is not quick enough or frequent.
Gregor and Iosef were always visiting the American Embassy in the lobby with two fat men eating a pile of burgers like a hungry wolf, and if "Comrade Detective" shortened to a narrower length, propaganda could better fulfill the Hicvini.
The message to the imaginary Communist observer can transform the eating of Western culture into anything that will beat in series.
Fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we do this to our own recent past and even theirs.
The ancestor of the Fetöânîler
The British government has seen that our family is loyal and devoted to fifty years of experience.
The Government's supreme authorities have acknowledged that this family has been sincerely committed to the British government and has been in great service.
The British government should be smart and careful about this seedling with their own hands, investigate and examine everything thoroughly and decide carefully.
While trying to understand the fetus, it is considered as a starting point for the organization of the pests, but an indispensable difference is that the Fetöis an organization that emerges in the imperialist period and acts with colonialist Saik.
These are the "pioneering movements" that should be addressed in the Minvalce.
In the English praise of the entrance, the person who described himself as the ' sapling of the British government ' was Mirza gulâm Ahmet Kadiyânî, the founder of Kaadiânîlik.
"On December 1, 1888, Allah said he ordered him to take a biate from his supporters and to create a separate congregation," The Qadian Ahmed, a small town in the Punjab province of India, said.
According to the revelation and the inspiration he received in 1891, he said that he had died of a death, of course, as other nebîs of Mary, and that Allah sent him as the prophet and the Mehdî, which the Christians and Muslims expected.
According to this, it is the same person who is waiting for Muslims and this is Mirza gulâm Ahmed kadiyânî.
(Islamic Encyclopedia, TDV)
In India, which was completely under British domination after the 1857 Sipahi Uprising, Gulâm Ahmed, who wrote books defending the Muslims under persecution against Hindus and Hrisitians, was believed to have been founded with all the Holy Saik, but the support of the Cıa Subsequently, the presidency of the Association of Communism in Erzurum, with the chairmanship of the Gulen anti-religious religion, reminds me of the portrait.
As the same smiley, the most beloved idea of the imperialists of Gulâm Ahmed is that the "jihad" is a struggle with the Muslims only with his own self, and that imperialism has no dimension to fight if you can live freely in your religion.
Even if you remember, the smiling one step further, the wounds in our history still open, even the attacks of the Crusaders praised in a ' sermon last year, ' said: "It is not too dangerous for the Crusaders to invade your country.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
For once, they don't have your woman, your daughter.
They are not associated with the shrine, the Crusaders who are not!
The idea that the Mahdi and the Messiah are united in itself, the notion that his community will be the savior of Islam, the concept of jihad is the only way to fight with the fetus, but also in general the form of the propagation of the Kaadi. It took place in the field of education and civil society.
The number of ' Tâbîlerin ' is said to exceed 2 million, and the total number of centers in the world is 1869, the number of countries where the emergency aid organization "Humanity First" was officially recorded is 23.
In addition, 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensary in 55 countries, 8 printing houses belonging only to kaadiânîlere in Africa; 505 educational institutions in 11 countries and approximately 16,000 mosques in the world are among the data.
Considering that the "first Muslim scientist", Prof. Abdüsselam, the President of the United Nations Court of Justice, Sir Zaferullah Khan, "The first Oscar award-winning Muslim actor" Mahershala Ali was also the winner of the Nobel Prize, the Global We can see more clearly the depth of the powers ' approval to the kaadiânîn.
Let us note that the meeting, which was made in England last week with 30,000 people, was polished as a body show.
One of his slogan is "Love everyone, don't hate anyone", and a brief glimpse of the dates to understand what the Kaaânî's are actually saying is "Love your Invaders/colonialists".
It is possible to drive the exit and motivation of the structures such as Hülasa, Fetöor Tahir-ul Kadri to the Kaadiânîs and all of these organizations are in fact aiming to be able to pass the imperialism and serve the colonisation Powered.
The "Last Wish" came out of the cargo
Emily Pomeranz (50), who spent her last days in a hospital in Washington due to pancreatic cancer, voiced her longing for a coffee and chocolate blended milkshake (milk drink) from a restaurant in her hometown.
A friend of hers contacted the owner of a restaurant called Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who has run the same restaurant for 47 years, put the drink on dry ice and sent a "fast delivery" shipment to the hospital 600 kilometers away, paying the price of 123 dollars (435 TL).

Bank of England to hold interest rates in 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will not change soon after reducing the speculation that slow economic growth and moving inflation would be an increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue "slow" due to the narrowing of family revenues, as well as keeping their interest rates steady.
The decision-makers of the Bank's Monetary policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest 0.25%; So, after weakening the support for the increase in slow economic growth, this month has asked for fewer members to increase.
The bank has warned growth estimates in the quarterly inflation report to 1.7% in 2017, 1.6% in 2018, and the household revenues will continue to shrink as inflation is still expected to increase by 3% in the spring.
However, he pointed out that interest increases are necessary to restrain Brexit's inflated inflation over the next few years, and that borrowing costs may be more increased than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw some of the massive economic remedial package launched a year ago, after Brexit.
The bank will end the periodic funding plan, which offers cheaper financing to banks from next February, but said it expects £15 billion more than the plan (totaling 115 billion).
The bank, minutes after the decision of interest, said: "The central estimate of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP), the collapse of real income in the household continues to be a burden to the consumption of the short term continues to slow."
He stressed that "some contravariance in monetary policy" might be necessary for alleviating inflation and that the market would be "a bit higher" than expected.
The markets are still predicting that the first increase will be in the third quarter of next year and another in the year 2020.
However, the bank stresses that any increase will be "step by step" and "limited".
According to estimates in May, the bank's reduced growth estimates for this year and next year are 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank maintains its estimate of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterling, after the news, lost value against the dollar and the euro.
The Pound fell 0.5%, 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% and 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change came after the GDP was 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the past three months, and the recent growth figures were disappointing, increasing their expectations.
Growth will likely remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but the bank will start to increase slightly by the end of the year.
The bank says the narrowest will get worse before it recovers, while the latest inflation report leaves little to be happy with the households that have been shot by increased inflation and small salary increases.
The bank said the monetary policy cannot "prevent" the shooting of revenues over the next few years, but it expects salaries to "significantly" improve towards the end of their three-year estimates.
As a result of the weak pound, the increase in demand for Britain's goods will support the economy by balancing some of the decreasing consumer spending.
The verdict comes one year after the shock of the EU referendum, which leads the pound upside down, after the last August, when the interest was reduced to 0.25%.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully influence the economy and prices.
Before the bank's most recent interest decision, the increase in inflation pressure on the hard households and the three policymakers in July to increase to 0.5%, the demand for a rising interest rate increase.
Inflation declined from 2.9% in July to 2.6% last month, but the bank said it would be expected and will increase once again in the coming months.
According to their 2% goals, the bank said the vaccine was "totally" about the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent declines in swap rates, the borrower has a request to do business and close the year positively, once again the mortgage market becomes even more competitive Next.
Sunday; In remortgaging, it seems particularly good for those approaching the end of their existing contracts, with many free options and low interest, becoming more and more popular than ever. "
NHS will write controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
In the Supreme Court, after a struggle for the drug's financing in the NHS, patients will be able to reach the ' transformative ' hıv prevention treatment from September.
The NHS UK is shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk people by around 86 per cent, a pill taken prior to sex, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) by a 3-year pre-trial by the health services of up to approximately 10,000 people .
The Supreme Court's decision last year has agreed to finance the experiment after the Supreme Court's approval. The resolution said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP, despite allegations of financing local authorities.
This move, announced on Thursday, was met by Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS UK, as a ' new and serious intervention ', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a ' turning point '.
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to record the public clinics, with the participation of more clinics in October, which will be fully implemented by the UK throughout the United Kingdom until April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a series of HIV drugs that reduce the risk of grabbing a hole before sex.
The trials showed that PrEP significantly reduced the transfer of the HIV between those who are at risk of infection.
Getting PrEP before sex means there's enough of drugs in one person's body to prevent the infection from settling.
This kind of medication can be taken every day, or just two hours before sex.
Those who are eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transgender people and HIV-positive partners who are not successfully cured.
Clinics; The cases of men, women, transgender individuals and their partners will determine the appropriate participants to be satisfied with the experiment from unknown persons who are controlled by an anti-retroviral treatment.
People who live in England and who are registered to a general practitioner may also enroll for potential participation in participating local sexual health clinics.
The Program will hold 10 million pounds and the NHS has signed an agreement to provide the medicines this week with an international bid of England.
The experiment was designed to assess Prep's full potential by gathering clinical evidence on how Prep was targeted, executed and applied on a large scale.
Mr. Stevens said: ' This new and serious intervention will contribute to the wide-ranging and increasing efforts in the foreing of the hıv.
This is another milestone in thirty years of development in order to take down one of humanity's major health problems. "
NAT (National Aids Trust) president Deborah Gold said: ' This is a turning point in the fight against the Hıv.
If it is aimed right at those in need and at risk, PrEP offers the possibility of transforming the outbreak of the HIV in England.
As of September, people with a high degree of risk will reach a new and powerful vehicle, which is truly privately controlled and not open to negotiating with a spouse, through this experiment funded by the NHS in Britain; This will cause a lot of life to heal.
We warmly welcome this announcement. '
The president of Terrence Higgins Trust, Ian Green, said: ' Priority should be to ensure that the experiment is presented quickly nationwide and that no one with a risk of being left behind.
Since the PrEP test medication is now available, we are on the right path to protect more than 10,000 people at risk. '
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: ' We welcome the start of the PrEP experiment and are late for months of delays and then the government's foot-pole.
The evidence suggests that this drug could be a part of our view of the prevention of the HIV and how much transformative the transmission of this life-altering infection could be.
The experiment will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this experiment be presented as quickly as possible across the country to protect the people exposed to the hıv and to finish the spread of the community.

Two Secrets of Death
Former industry and trade Minister Ayhan Çilingiroğlu's daughter born in Washington, Ümit Makbule Cilingiroğlu (51) Istanbul Levent, a business center used as a hotel, fell down from the 19th floor died.
Koç University student 24-year-old Melis Salihoğlu was found dead in his home.
Salihoğlu'nun hanged himself was suggested.
Two secrets that were followed in succession and considered suicide by the police were initiated by the investigation.
' He had a depressed state '
The first Minister of Industry and Trade of Turkey, Ayhan Cilingiroğlu, who served in the government of Nihat Erim in 1971, was born in Washington in 1966, Umit Makbule Çilingiroğlu, on 1 August at 17.00 at Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler.
In the room on the 19th floor and not heard from him for a while, the dead body of Cilingiroğlu'nun the hotel management of a Kuwaiti tourists to inform the event was called the ambulance and police team.
The health team, the 19th floor of the hard floor, the Cilingiroğlu lost his life determined.
Anne Mediha Cilingiroğlu, who testified to the police, "recently had a depressed state."
He arrived in Istanbul from Ankara on July 31.
I have a grandson with leukemia from my other daughter.
"He was interested in my grandson and was negatively influenced by my grandson's illness."
Cilingiroğlu, removed from the funeral of the forensic medicine institution, is expected to be buried in Ankara.
It is being investigated whether Cilingiroğlu was disposed by someone or committed suicide.
' His own life ' claim
Another suspicious death in Istanbul was in Sarıyer Zekeriyaköy.
He was found dead in his home at Koç University (24).
According to the allegations, the young girl's father, who did not receive the news and his cell phone, the daughter went to his home near the school.
Dad, he was at home with his daughter's lifeless body.
His family, his close surroundings and his friends by the beloved Melis's home by hanging himself in the end of his life was suggested.
The death of Melis Salihoğlu strangled the family and relatives of the law.
After Melis, a friend in social media, "a sparkling sun hit our faces."
We were enjoying the green grass under our feet, your best friend Jack, and your sister, Eyşan, chasing that little plastic ball.
"What needed to die Now" shared the message.
Living Luxury: Mezzanine and smart design numbers this little Earls has turned the Courts apartment into a fresh home.
The former banker Joanne Leigh, who had a passion for real estate renovation, went from a large house in Knightsbridge to a small apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
It's the first floor of a swanky Queen Anne-style comb, and it's proof of the new design that Joanne was convinced without packing her bags.
"Before that, I lived in a much larger area in Knightsbridge with my ex-boyfriend," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something equivalent to my price.
The apartment at Earl Court was shown to me and had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and I made an offer that day. "
After the first view, the 1000 ft squared circle was renewed from the top down.
It was originally a one-bedroom and complex-planned property; You had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom. Joanne asked to add a storage space and a mezzanine coat to make the maximum use of generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows and a lot of light.
It was my condition, "he said.
For this purpose, the Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio, Duck & Shed, hired Erfan Azadi to benefit from the 12.5 ft ceiling and to create a place not only a structure but also Joanne's experience.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two overlapping areas, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine fold in which you could stand.
Erfan had to think in a creative way to solve the matter.
"Steel skeleton is quite complicated."
"We had to adjust the gaps so that they could pile up without needing to bend over each other.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but also the steels would be so inclined that they would be at the right height according to the top or bottom function. "
This arrangement also brought many additional dramas, allowing Erfan to get two full-size rooms on top of each other.
The old-type Copper light window from Retrouvius for the mezzanine floor is looking at the magnificent living space below.
Mirrored gold furnishings, silver accents and old-fashioned Serge Mouille lighting all set the style of the bill.
Using mirrors plays a role in adding space and light.
The mirrors placed on both ends of the short corridor make it look longer.
The Mirror Ranger panel in the kitchen gives the feeling of a window opening to another room.
Mirrored units in the warehouse provide a storage space for Joanne's entire cutlery and glassware.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a more spectacular perception of space, is to close the kitchen when not in use.
The collapsible kitchens are not new.
The original one is that there is a door that can be lifted up in the style of the garage.
Erfan, steel-reinforced polished MDF door, "We have used some engineering in this," he explains.
"It's got a balance weight, so it really slips when you push the door up."
With the cleverly utilised area and storage space, Joanne has won an additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom and an improved session plan.
"At the end of the day, the session area is what you sell, or the value of your property is determined," says Erfan.
"As Iptidai, a realtor will enter and make a calculation on the basis of the session area."
They managed to use quality materials that gave the luxury look to the area while increasing the floor area.
"Materials are the objects you touch and thus help you to establish an emotional connection at home," Erfan says
"At home, you don't fall in love with the power lines on the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't shake the strings of your heart. "
It is proof that an apartment can be transformed into something quite spectacular from the standard thing, through well-designed and enhanced square meters.
Actually, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.

Brothers fighting for the 500 million property empire
Two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, which is worth more than 500 million, forty years after the dynasty of Italian families.
Former Carlton Football Club director and contractor Colin De Lutis lives three doors away from his younger brother, Paul, who gave himself to the Supreme Court on how to share property and business assets at a mansion in Toorak.
Paul has been trying to get out of the family business since 2014, but hard discussions continued in the Supreme Court about the breakup.
With their mother Anna, the brothers are the owners of 38 property, which is worth more than half a billion dollars accumulated since a store they bought in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and raised it to a chain of 160 retail outlets.
Sold to $85 million in 1999.
This money has been deposited in the property and De Lutis's portfolio currently includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento contracting sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller Apartments and suburban shopping malls.
Under an agreement with deceased fathers, Colin (also described as "an important driving force and dominant personality" by Paul in the Lutis family) has two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul has one third.
A court file says that it means that Colin has property worth 316 million and Paul's $176 million.
For Paul to divide his property and cash, he turns out to be a contentialized subject.
In his first sworn testimony to the court in 2015, he wrote: "The divisions proposed by Colin were leaving him with the properties that I always called the best."
Last Friday, after the mediation of many failures, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
Brothers also fight about who will control the current job; Paul claims that Colin left him out of the business.
Colin argues that it's not true, but he blames Paul for managing some of the property in a clumsy way.
Colin says he hopes to resolve the dispute in a sworn testimony at the beginning.
"My Italian roots dictate to me that the family is the most important priority."
Hundreds of pages of sworn testimony, e-mails and the best lawyers, such as Allan Myers, QC, and Senior legal advisors held by both parties, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer The expenses in the case are increasing together.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were a family of Italian immigrants who ran grocery stores and delicatessen from the end of the 1950s, and they bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They pawned their property to buy the Collingwood property that Colin opened in the family's first jeans store.
Colin says, "my senior year in high school, when Paul was a little boy (10 years old)" he set up Westco.
Anna De Lutis himself and Luigi, who died in 2012, said he hoped to leave his possessions in a friendly way to his sons.
"Luigi told me often that he would never want the brothers to fall in court," he wrote.
The other two brothers Mark and Luke are no longer part of the Lutis group of companies; According to Colin, when he quit, Mark was paid $10 million for Luke and $26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were dissatisfied with the terms of their financial breakups.
According to the 2015 biography of Eddi McGuire, best friend of the television star, Colin was a member of the board of Directors of the former AFL club, but tried not to draw attention.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and his lawyers on Friday.
Just because Colin was in court with a text message, he replied, "I can't say much."
"It must have been very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and dragged our family's name to the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote that he was trying to fulfill his brother's demands in a court application.
"Our Father, Paul and I would not want us to fall into the present conflict," he added, adding that he was "still hopeful about the solution."
It seems that hope is lost on Friday.
"The problem will be solved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new special item plans to limit the president's media diet.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly could really do that.
If that happens, it's the first.
Politico reports that the new White House special pen would limit the flow of information (including news media reports) to President Trump, hoping to keep the boss more stable.
Some minor information from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the White House's new special item, met with senior staff on his first day at work, he summed up a fundamental problem that President Donald Trump was planning to solve about the White House: The president's hand in bad information.
Kelly told the staff, whether on paper or briefings, that the information should flow through itself, because the president could make better decisions when he was given good information.
Kelly's diagnosis makes a lot of sense, but others have tried to overdo Trump by controlling the media diet and failing.
President Trump's relationship with the TV goes on for decades, and he's in the White House now, and he's still in good shape.
"If candidate Trump was upset that it was not fair in the media, it was an efficiency enhancer to show that he had found a fair place in media outlets that could be persuaded," a former campaign adviser, Sam Nunberg, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri from Politico at the time "according to six campaign assistants, the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control was to ensure that personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise," he wrote.
Ok.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit is "under control" at any time is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign attendants know something the rest of our people don't, like Trump's tweets will be much more provocative without their intervention.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff were able to get him out of danger several times, then his efforts were worth it.
But no one has ever prevented Trump from making a constant argument.
Part of the problem is that the White House has been competing against each other, in any case, trying to advance their agendas with the materials they offer to Trump (which could be credible or unreliable) and the people who put their worldview .
In May, Politico reported the tendency of consultants to strategically transmit questionable information to the president during the entire story.
Here's an example of reporter Shane Goldmacher detailing:
"The current and former Trump officials say Trump has reacted in a fierce way to negative clippings, particularly the bad effects, and is losing it to find out where they originated.
At the end of February, one of the president of the Internet Provocator Charles C. Johnson's site, from GotNews, has a printed copy of an article accusing special pen assistant Katie Walsh of being the "source behind a series of leaks" in the White House. And that's what happened.
It was of no importance that Johnson had been banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he had not presented any concrete evidence, or that he had turned over fraudulent accusations in the past and returned from them.
Trump read the article and started asking the staff about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the time the special pencil reince Priebus and White House staff Secretary Rob Porter "tried to place a system that manages and documenting the paperwork that Trump has received".
How did that end?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing in three months.
Perhaps he will emerge as a more influential manager than Priebus, but Trump is still in his own impulsive and his assistants are still competing for penetration.
These immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Crypto fetö"revealed with special template
Izmir Public Prosecutor Berkant Karakaya, "investigation of military espionage" irregularities in the scope of the investigation of some information about the leak of the "Ivy" code-named Secret witness of the Navy command chief of Staff Tümamiral has completed the investigation initiated by Cihat Yaycı, who said he was a fetöist.

Tümamiral Yaycı was tried on charges of insult before.
It turned out that there were still fetöors, and the alleged crime was the calipback.
The former air Pilot staff Colonel Hakan Dinç, who complained that the Yaycı insulted him, is the only information note in the form of the old Adana Incirlik 10.

Some of the members of the organization, including Tuncay Opçin, who were the Fethand, appeared to target the Yaycı with their share of social media before and after the coup attempt on July 15.
Travelers surpassed the ditch, returned to the ' rich neighborhood '
Some of the wealthiest hosts in the West Midlands are fighting again with ambitious travelers who have been excavated by the Council to reclaim space outside their mansions.
Travellers parked their 20 caravans outside a field called the ' rich neighbourhood ', which is the street of Solihull.
They came back after being fired in May, bringing horses, babies and a load of wagons from the ditch that the Council dug to cut their raids.
The smart-moving group found a loophole in the defense, infiltrated the vehicle by setting a path from a section that was left without a barricades.
The angry residents criticized the Solihull Council, saying it was "useless in solving the problem".
An unnamed resident said: "They arrived on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
They should be ashamed of the council movements because they are useless to solve the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were sent, and now they've come back.
Last night came a lot more, and it's probably going to be more today. "
Added: ' The Birmingham council knows how to deal with the long restraining decisions taken to protect the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Street, and I'm not happy to continue paying my taxes while the council can't even stop it. '
A resident who did not want to give his name said: ' Like a joke, we saw that the last group of travelers were leaving yet, that we were immediately devastated by a new group.
The numbers had risen this time and a horse was even graded in the parking lot. '
A female spokesperson from the Solihull Council said: ' We are aware that there is an unauthorized camp on Streetsbrook Street, and we are starting the legal proceedings as soon as necessary to send them from there.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible call 101, they report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police.
This will help the Court to take into consideration when we submit our case to court. '

Italy hardens NGOs ' approach to immigrant rescue bots
Italy has warned NGOs that operate an immigrant rescue boat in the Mediterranean will not be allowed to continue if they do not comply with new rules affecting their operations.
"If the NGOs do not comply with the new charter, it will be hard to see that they continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Torino newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti's warning, the Italian authorities, a boat operated by the German charity Jugend Rettet, the crew, in a manner facilitating illegal immigration, the suspicion of actively cooperating with human traffickers, hand- He came a day after he was put on.
The aid agency, which has been active for only one year, refused to comment on the contents of the elaborate accusations against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"The Saving of human life for us is our most important priority and it will be, so we are very sorry that we cannot work in the search and rescue zone at this time," the organisation said in a social media statement.
"We can, however, evaluate the charges that are currently being made after gathering all the information and evaluating the situation."
Italian authorities have been watching Jugend Rettet's boat Iuventa since October.
It is suspected that the crew has taken the rubber boots full of immigrants delivered directly to them by human traffickers and allows smugglers to flee with boats to be used again.
According to the prosecutor's files published by the Italian media, at least a single meeting like this, allegedly took place 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast.
The crew is accused of ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, who overtakes the rescue operations in the region due to humanitarian effort from another purpose.
According to the Charter, it was supposed to be an Italian police officer on the deck of boats like Iuventa, clearly spying on their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the Charter by now: Save the Children, Malta-based MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Tuesday that the new rules would be unnecessary but acceptable, because they would not cause any "serious change or obstacle" in their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel prize-winning organization has doctors (MSF) Without Borders.
Minniti, meanwhile, said the sharp decline in the number of immigrants arriving in Italy after last weeks ' efforts to strengthen Libyan coast security and co-operation with local governors are indicative of fruit.
The minister said: "In recent days we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel."
This month, Libyan governors announced plans to make more calls about economic development initiatives and take measures to reduce the number of migrants who have left Chad, Niger and Mali and those countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Last-minute punch!

The reporter, who convedes the developments of the day in the live broadcast, suddenly appears and cursing "we will seize Ukraine". He warned the man who shouted, "Please shut up."
The drunken man who was mentioned as the former paratrooper threw a hard punch at him on the reporter's warning.
The reporter, who was stunned by his fist stroke, tried to get away from him.
Millions of people watched the shocking moment live.
Economic Coordination Committee convened

It is possible to get rid of a hernia 45 minutes
It is noted that only 5 percent of patients should be operated in the treatment of lumbar hernia. Dr. Oguz Karaeminoğulları, "The patient's examination and imaging results according to the first step is rest and medication treatment," he says.
Especially in the patient group where the pain persists, the interventional methods (such as epidural injection, radiofrequency techniques, in-disk interventions) should be tried, stating that Oguz Karaeminoğulları, "if success can not be achieved from all these methods, If numbness and weakness in the legs become apparent, then the surgery becomes mandatory, "he warned.
Karaeminogullari, which minimizes the risk of ' full closed lumbar hernia surgery ' in the interventional methods of patients who can not get results by expressing the reduction in surgery, which allows the decrease of lumbar hernia disease 45 It is possible to get rid of the minute as follows:
Although very good results are obtained compared to open surgery with microscopic surgery, the long recovery period after the operation, adhesions to the spinal cord, recurrence of the hernia and some complications such as lumbar and infection may develop in the future may be encountered.
Microscopic surgery is often described as ' closed surgery ', but microscopic surgery is applied with the same approach as open surgery.
These risks are eliminated because the surrounding tissues are preserved in full closed lumbar hernia surgery.
Full-closed lumbar hernia surgery lasts only 45 minutes.
Special Commission at work
CHP deputies Mehmet Gökdag, Cemal Okan Yüksel, Peace Yarkadaş and Supreme Disciplinary Board member Turan Aydoğan will take place.
Commission, Berberoğlu Istanbul 14th on October 4.
He will also follow the appeals to the Constitutional Court and the District Istinaf Tribunal with his trial at the criminal Tribunal.
CHP Secretary-General Kamil Okyay, and deputy chairman Bulent Tezcan, the signature of the assignment in the article, "The judiciary is independent and neutral, not taking orders from anywhere outside of the law is indispensable for justice."
"Our lawmaker, Mr. Enis Berberoğlu, has not demanded any special status while serving as a lawmaker, he has not been able to defend the immunity armor known to lawmakers, he wanted to preserve his belief in the independent and objectivity of the judiciary."
The trial process suggests that the Court prefers to implement political orders instead of making judgments.
The article argued that the Constitutional Court's decision to arrest lawmakers wrongly, despite the fact that the verdict was not finalization, was a clear proof that the court had decided under the influence.
Michelle Carter has been sentenced for messages that encourage Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through messages and phone calls.
Now, 20 years old, Michelle Carter, 15 months of punishment behind bars and five years as a legitimate evacuation.
Carter was convicted in June for the murder of Conrad Roy, who killed himself on July 13, 2014.
Mr. Roy's father said Thursday at the hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to go free to be open.
Although he faced a maximum of 20 years of punishment, his legal team argued that he and Mr. Roy suffered from mental illness.
Wearing red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter was struck with old eyes, his hands clamped and his eyes looked down.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
She ended her life to heal hers.
He did not accept responsibility, "he said.
"He never showed remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was a terrible situation that he regretted entirely."
But Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not see his "age, maturity, or even a significant impact on the actions of mental illness".
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr. Roy's mother, Lynn Roy: "There is no day that I will not mourn my beloved son's loss.
I want him to be proud of me and how I handle everything. I try to be with his sisters, with all the pain that we carry forever. "
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that his brother could never attend his wedding, or that his children would never be "out of his mind".
"The absence of that person you've been with every day since I was born is a pain that will always be with me for the rest of my life," he said.
It looks like he's going to create a lawsuit because there's no Massachusetts law that counts as a crime to tell a person to commit suicide.
Mr. Roy was 17 years old when he was found dead in a vehicle from carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The case revealed that Carter's text messages encouraged him to end his own life, attracting national attention.
When she was on vacation with her parents, she said in many messages she sent two weeks before her death: "Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there's a lot of ways."
In the moments before his suicide, he wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "all you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz, instructed not to allow him to withdraw from this case through the press, said that Carter wanted to draw attention through Mr. Roy's death.
The case interrupted the legal views.
There was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of killing the British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being exiled two years ago between the defending minority of Carter.
Ms. Knox (30) has released an article in the Los Angeles Times that says: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail."
Striking growth forecast by Mehmet Simsek
Simsek, in his statement, said inflation in Turkey should be reduced to single-digit numbers, and the food inflation "risk area" has expressed the creation.
The Deputy Prime Minister predicts inflation will land below 7 per cent in 2018.
In the Lightning speech, he said:
The next 12 months are critical in the reduction of uncertainties.
The greatest incentive is the reduction of uncertainties.
There's a strong government.
No political ambiguity.
I hope the uncertainties in our near geography are reduced.
By increasing our resistance to shocks with a certain amount of reform, I believe that we can put Turkey on a growth trend of 5 percent.
I said that months ago.
Because the worst is behind you.
Gradually, our energy is not to those areas, but to grow our energy into the container, to increase the employment reforms...
That's why the next 12 months are critical.
Reform on the one hand, lack of uncertainty on the one hand, there is already no political ambiguity.
I hope we get lucky and the troubles in our close geography are reduced.
And whether we want it or not, our many classic markets have collapsed.
Libya, like Iraq.
We're not just losing the market, we're dealing with over 3.5 million immigration waves.
When we looked at the last 15 years, Turkey grew 5.7 percent despite all the shocks.
Turkey, which means we have solid problems.
Now, by increasing our resistance to shocks with a little bit of reform, a small amount of investors in the minds of the question marks more than 5 percent of Turkey re-growth policy.
Let me tell you, I have this generous retirement system from here.
I think it would be reasonable if I told you that our retirement companies didn't make enough effort.
Once auto-join performance will be strong.
Why?
Because we took precautions.
Companies don't have to go and make an effort.
We have been working on how to allocate global assets to which investment areas, taking into consideration the poor performance, considering these concerns.
You know the deposits are high.
There will be a performance in addition to the 25 percent of the state it once gave to the net.
The rest of the supplement is on the Treasury papers, and there's a low risk.
When we look at the big picture, I think it will increase your interest in the next semester.
Because they'll see the performance.
There is no failure in the other field, but success.
We restructured the BES in 2013.
6.8 million participants, 70 billion pounds of accumulation.
Give it a good system.
There are 2.6 million participants in automatic participation, 775 million pounds.
We want a little more effort from the firms.
Let them advertise, tell them about this system.
We work in withdrawal time.
Maybe if we flex him a little...
We'll look, we're working.
Maybe the citizens see the return, see the accumulation, and stay in the system.
The system is 38 percent.
Nearly half of the separatables are voluntary individual retirement.
You don't want two personal retirement accounts.
What are you guys doing?
You're out of auto attendance.
We were actually expecting a withdrawal around 10 percent.
That means we're very optimistic.
The system works once.
We've brought a prime ceiling.
The insurance companies are explaining it one-sided sometimes.
They've boosted their bonuses too fast.
When we asked what was going on, they said the judicial decisions did not take into consideration the current arrangements.
We have made the new net arrangement.
We said, "do the same."
They said no, we wait for the judge.
We just said it wouldn't be like that.
We have a breakup here.
Of course, when this ceiling premium application, some companies have been immarked.
We've made a new arrangement.
We've created a pool of risky insurance.
Let me tell you this.
I prefer the operation of this system through competition.
So I don't find this ceiling price applications right, they forced us to.
I want to look at this in three dimensions.
Let the system be considered.
Two, the system is normal, a pricing on that trail.
In addition to him heavy loads, each paid 100 pounds of bonus is going to tax sgk cuts almost 30-31 pounds.
I'm working on it now, so we're going to talk to the Treasury secretary.
Thirdly, technology is evolving rapidly.
Now over time, traffic accidents will also severely diminish structurally.
But this is mandatory traffic insurance.
Morning's headline saved his leg
Buerger's disease, which emerged from the age of puberty, was a disorder seen in men, but nowadays it is now often observed in women.
One of these women is the 36-year-old Moonlight Dursun.
The pains that started two years ago were chronics on the soles of the feet.
When the young woman, who was forced to walk, faced the risk of losing her leg, the hospital traveled to the hospital.
A friend suggested Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
The headline in the morning ' Azerbaijan saved the life of the Minister of Extraordinary Peoples ' showed the news.
It turned out that Dursun, who went to Kalko, struggled with Buerger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko has taken the young woman to emergency surgery.
As soon as his pain survives, he is now recovering from oxygen.
Automobile manufacturers will modify the Audi 850,000 diesel vehicle against adverse reactions
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer a software upgrade to more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW's chairman, BMW's headquarters (considering the prohibition or limitation of diesel vehicles), including Munich, referring to European cities, said the firm believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving limitations".
Daimler said on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be modified to lower their diesel emissions.
None of the companies described these moves as callbacks.
European car manufacturers have intensified the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
However, the nitrogen oxides exposed by diesel engines are called cancer makers and can cause asthma.
The cost of the equipment that the automotive companies need to wear to neutralize the dirty smoke made by diesel vehicles also increases and makes it difficult for the price of automobiles to remain competitive.
While German car manufacturers were facing investigations, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government was also accused of spoiling strong automobile companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies that conceal the use of a device known as a deceptive device and adjust the emissions to comply with regulations while a car is being tested, to refrain from repeating the Volkswagen's faults in normal driving conditions They work.
Many Volkswagen managers were indicted in the United States and others were also under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, Audi's engine development division, the former head of thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and therefore not protected against extradition and can be judged in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a German criminal investigation involving the Volkswagen; Authorities have expanded the United States-based investigation after accusing Audi of plugging in a system to get rid of emissions rules in Europe.
Audi's inclusion in the investigation may be too heavy for Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer has an extreme share of the Volkswagen's profits.
Jump to every single saw
Prof. Dr. Yusuf Şükrü Çağlar, the president of the Turkish Neurosurgical Society, made a warning that the depth of the two meters was not skipped to the shallow places.
Every year thousands of people face the risk of paralysis due to neck fracture and spinal cord damage due to diving into shallow water.
Neck fractures are most commonly developed in 5 or 6-nth vertenole.
The characteristic of fractures is that it affects the muscles of the arm and leg as well as the nerves that nourish the respiratory muscles.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar, "In this type of accidents, our most precious organ of the neck spinal cord, broken due to fracture caused by the spine is cut or disabled by the function."
"The wrong first aid in spinal cord injuries is not only increasing damage to the survivors, it can lead to death as well," he said.
Diving into water is the fourth place in spinal cord injuries.
The average age of injuries is 20-29 and the majority is male.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar, "The invisible water should not be skipped."
He said, "No matter how well you dive, you can have a severe injury."
Prof. Dr. Çağlar also reminded me of the following:
Depending on the level of spinal cord where there is damage causing injury while fishing, different degrees of paralysis can occur in the arms and legs.
You may know how to swim, but water can be deceptive.
The place that looks like deep can be shallow.
With warning signs placed on the sea coast in the United States and Australia, the 70 percent decrease in shallow water dive-jumping cases.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar, "Although 28 provinces are located in Turkey, there is unfortunately not a single warning sign in places outside Istanbul."
"In relation to these types of accidents in life, every summer before the Health Directorate, Schools and Social awareness project in the beaches and ponds under the attention of information light or knowledge boards should be kept in a remarkable way," he said .
Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, President of the Turkish Neurosurgical Society Spinal and Peripheral nerve surgery group, suggested that the following:
At the time of the event, the first job should be sought 112.
The neck should be kept as steady as possible, not moved, and identified with a hard collar.
The airway must be provided and the patient must be tilted upside down for drainage of the water escaping from the lung.
It shouldn't be wrapped around the legs to drain the water.
The deformity of the patient's neck shouldn't be corrected.
The cervical vertebrae may be broken.
However, if the spinal cord has not yet been damaged, an inappropriate position to be given to the neck during the first aid and the patient's carriage may cause the broken bone fragments to pressure and cut damage to the spinal cord.
Provence Lavender threatened by climate change
It was transformed into a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is under threat of climate change.
Lavender suffers from drought-like conditions and disease-bearing insects, which leads to a major headache for scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based Agricultural Research Institute Crıeppam, said: "Lavender in Provence is in an effective danger because in recent years the plant has a much less and mostly autumn climate Effects of the change.
It affects the life of lavender.
There's also a small cicada with a leaf pest that transmicks microbacteria, and it's too dry in the air. "
And many things are at stake.
He's been pursuing a great deal of lavender oil for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "With a few large flowers, we need to have a very long plant spike, smaller, less developed or never, or weak.
So we have fewer essential fatty parts. "
The revised solutions include better water distribution and slowing down the evaporation of the soil, but there is also a protective slime and water mixture to the plants, and to develop more durable species in dry conditions.
Journalist's murder underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Weekly newspaper Riodoce's staff often meet on Wednesdays to review the latest chaos, corrupt officers, and endless drug wars in the newspaper in the state of Sinaloa, in order to consider their plans to be in the paper.
But on this day, they came together to discuss their safety in the shadow of their own tragedies.
They said it was important that they change their routines.
Two senior journalists see what feels safer: bring their children to the office in 2009, the target of a hand grenade, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard in front of the room: adverbs, neutrals, allies.
They want reporters to propose names for each column; There is no need for proof, perception and inner voices are sufficient.
Suspected drug traffickers, politicians, business people, government, or cartels who have been tied to the salary, a list of all the bad guys that made Mexico's chaos dangerous to write in the paper.
There is no violence, while the number of bodies across the country is increasing, more and more journalists are: according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists, President Enrique Pena Nieto has been at least 25 people since his mission in December 2012; After the attacks and threats, 589 is under federal protection, and at least seven states have died this year.
Among the last dead, there are editorial managers and inspiration sources, Riodoce founding partner Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," says Valdez, in one of many books on narcotics violence.
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence is hanging on the façade of Riodoce's building with the word "justice", a large photograph of Valdez showing his middle finger everywhere; Two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are wearing T-shirts that show her smile, her glasses face, and the Panama hat with the alametimouse.
The workshop takes place two months before his death; Reporters talk about their common traumas, their nightmares, their sleeplessness, their paranoia.
In 2010, a special federal prosecutor was created to address journalists ' cases, but according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, he only prosecuted two.
As with most of the thousands of murders that are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists ' killers are rarely put in front of the law.
In Riodoce; Although their hearts are broken, the ground is now more deceptive, insisting on the violence in Sinaloa.
Without knowledge of the killers, it's very little to discuss security without justice, says Ibarra.
"Wasting my time on this workshop is stupid," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the RIODOCE office in Culiacan, the state capital.
The red Toyota Corolla was only able to take a few blocks before it was stopped by two men; He was forcefully removed from his vehicle and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of his newspaper, which was translated as the Twelfth River.
The gunman walked away in his car and hit the vehicle nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
His wife and two adult children are left.
In Culiacan, rumors tend to roam freely.
But there's nothing but silence about Valdez.
Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country when rival groups fought to fill the void after the arrest of Guzman last year and the return to the United States on the stove.
In Sinaloa, never forget that one or many people are shot and killed every day on the street, or that the cemetery is filled with tombs of the drug kings that are larger than many of the houses to live in.
For one minute, forget about the "serenity" situation, which only checks the precious ports of the single cartel and the drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite this, and although he was deeply aware of the dangers of Valdez's work, the founding partner and director of Riodoce, Ismail Bojorquez (60), was devastated by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to the murder.
First, there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, leader of one of the rival cartel groups, who were at war with Guzman's sons in a February broadcast.
This article may have offended his sons; Possible gang members bought every copy of the print as soon as they were dealt to the newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper, which included the same story.
Valdez was a myth in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a turning point in Mexican origin against journalists.
He'd been alive for too long, and his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroeste in 2013 when he joined five colleagues selling $50 shares in the emergence of Riodoce.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without referring to narcotics," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper gained fame with bold and honest news and increased sales and advertising.
The reporters loved to publish life-consuming research without fear of censorship, and readers had lost themselves to a publication where they could read stories that no one dared to report.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for the Committee on the Protection of journalists, as the tip of the Mexican drug story had the courage to pursue it.
He clearly admitted that he was afraid.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to continue living."
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, drug trafficking in Sinaloa said "it's a way of life."
"As a journalist, you must accept your duty. It's either that or you play dumb.
What you were doing to me in the face of so many deaths... Why didn't you tell me what was going on? "
The RIODOCE staff misses Valdez; His teachers who know how to survive, who are generous to the prank, hugs and advisating like Porter.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He used to go to a bar called El Guayabo across the office and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Did his love for his routines collapse?
His death forced them to question their assumptions about how best to do their job and survive.
"If you deal with their women, their children, their clean business, the secret airstrip they use to transport drugs, they don't like it."
"These things were to cross the line," Bojorquez said.
The result was a high-grade autocensorship and self-preservation, even at the best time.
Trusting your own instincts.
If it smells bad, stay out of it.
"The scent is a delusible sensation... and it happened to Javier." said Riodoce editor-in-chief Andres Villarreal.
He and others say the old rules in Sinaloa are not valid; The same as Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and snowy smuggling routes, which are a toxic mixture, are not valid in other states that host weak institutions and corrupt government officials...
The floor is constantly changing.
No cell phone is allowed in the room where RIODOCE personnel meet for safety training; Days ago, it turned out that only spy software sold to governments was used to pry journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two police officers outside wanted to get rid of a tree in the shade of 104 degrees Celsius (40 centigrade).
They were appropriated by the State Government to protect the Riodoce's office in a four-storey building in Culiacan's middle-class district.
Half-joking, half-serious, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the policemen within 50 percent of the governor himself said he was not trustworthy.
It's been months before the reporters went to the mountainous countryside where the drug gangs actually controlled it.
In this week's issue, Riodoce is going through three main stories.
Former great boxer Julio Cesar Chavez had his brother's murder in Sinaloa.
Also, the governor's hometown had a bankruptcy of concentrated government expenditures.
and a block away from the prosecution was the abduction of a group in Culiacan's most expensive restaurant.
There was no formal explanation of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so when it was time to write that everyone in the city knew it, the restaurant was the favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter has learned from official records that the restaurant is registered under the name of a politician who is a member of the Corporate Revolutionary Party (Prı), dominated by almost every level of politics in the last century.
Recently many Prı governor has been accused of corruption in sensational events.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about the events that happened earlier, including one of "El Chapo" Guzman's sons in a military raid.
Only months ago, readers would look at the corner of Valdez for information from the best source of abduction.
Dubbed "El Flaco" because of its fine nature, Villareal (46) said, "We already knew what was going on."
"We've lost all communication channels with our resources now."
When the staff turns to something they never expected, activists on behalf of the press, Valdez's office is being re-used as a repository for banners and stickers that protest journalist murders.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few banners and went on a show the next morning for another journalist in the local prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt corpse was found, and according to DNA tests, the officials say it was him.
Journalists throughout the country have expressed their thoughts louder by writing "Help to the press" in organised protests and sidewalks and buildings.
Today, director Bojorquez is trying to provide international support for justice in the Valdez case, away in Washington.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
From that day on, he thought that his anger had damaged his neutrality, and he wanted to be assigned to another mission to do the government news.
The Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organised crime, accomplice and an indifferent society.
In his latest book "Narco-journalism," he wrote that journalists are being killed not only by drug gangs, but by order of politicians and security forces in co-operation with organised crime.
Media Watcher Group Articulo 19, last year, more than half of the attacks on journalists connected to the police and official officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez said.
The murders clearly made a cold shower effect.
No one remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias, six years ago, in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
His body was found with a note that was signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my news."
A computer keyboard and headphones are sprinted next to the severed head.
After the murder of reporter Miroslava Breach in March in the northern border province of Chihuahua, some publications such as El Norte chose to close.
After the assassination of their principal in 2004, the others, like El Manana from Nuevo Laredo, continue.
In 2010, on the front page of the Diario de Ciudad Juarez, he addressed the chief article, the drug cartel: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their provinces, even the country.
It's a wrenching decision.
It's hard to get a job in exile, and they're still combing the streets waiting for danger.
Sometimes, three months after he escaped from Veracruz, in 2015, he and four women were captured in an apartment in Mexico City, just like the one they understood from Ruben Espinoza, the murdered photographer.
A dance made every day with these high-risk decisions for those who remain behind and work.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says that the drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter."
A recent Saturday at midnight, while preparing for the final issue, RIODOCE editorial managers sat on the sidewalk outside the office and drank beer and started ringing phones at the same time.
Near Mazatlan, a seaside resort, a series of armed clashes involving rival gangs and security forces have led to 19 verified deaths.
As promised in a series of cartel messages in the vicinity, the war continued to escalated.
They put the news on Riodoce's web site via mobile phones on the sidewalk.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
The sirens started to squeat nearby, and there's another gun shooting in the vicinity.
Bojorquez quickly took a look at the police officers guarding the guard to see if they were on the lookout.
If they were scared, they wouldn't show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the defeated founders of the newspapers, his middle finger was exhibited for the entire Sinaloa to see, and Riodoce's staff was following his footsteps.
"How can you think about shutting it down," Bojorquez said, "When Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him out to report on the street?"
He used camouflage to avoid dinosaur enemies.
It looks like a statue at first glance, but it's a terrible one.
The researchers have now announced that the first findings of an incredible creature in the Rhino dimension, found by a Canadian miner, are well preserved, and experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they could tell that the scaly skin was reddish brown and that it was a ' troubled past '.
The report in the Current Biology magazine described it as ' the best preserved armored dinosaur and one of the best dinosaur breeds in the world '.
The fossil is a newly discovered Nodozor species that lived 110 million to 112 million years ago from the middle of the Cretaceous period.
His extraordinarily well-preserved condition stunned the researchers who described him as ' truly spectacular '.
The plant-eating armored is the best preserved fossil of its kind, according to reports in National Geographic.
He was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in northern Alberta, Canada, digging the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray.
According to the Rock around him, he hit something that looked strange and decided to look closer.
The uncovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
They spent the next 6 years in the 2500 pound (1100 kg) of Earth, revealing the wild animal.
After such intense work, the completed result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you cut your eyes a little, you might even believe you're asleep," said the lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature was exhibited.
' One of the most beautiful in the history of science, and as the best preserved dinosaur species, will pass as the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs. '
Researchers examined his skin, although he was covered in armor and looked like a walking tank, and this plant was probably faced with a serious threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
The highly armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a protective technique known as contra-shading, used by many modern animals.
Experts say it has been hunted by larger dinosaurs, allowing it to blend better around and overcome its enemies.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodozor Family first appeared in the headlines in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The researchers have now finished their work and named it Borealopelta Markmitchelli, a wild animal who was one of the team who spent more than 7000 hours laborious time trying to uncover it.
The extraordinary preservation of the species made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists to document the shape and armour on the body with the pattern of stamps.
They discovered the Contra shading, which is a common defensive method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the upper part of the creature is darker than the bottom.
Although Contra shading is common, the findings are surprising because the size of the borealopelta exceeds the animals that are living in the current contra.
This means that the dinosaur has been sufficiently pressured by meat-eating dinosaurs, and that evolution prefers to face hiding as a method of survival.
But the most contemporary animals that use contra shading (e.g. deer, zebras or armadillos) are much smaller and explain much more to being a prey; It means that Nodozor has faced a serious difficulty to survive.
Brown, ' strong hunting for a massive, heavily armoured animal shows how dangerous dinosaur predators in kretase can be, ' he said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in scales revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about his life, including preserved bowel contents, to find out what he ate at his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into a river and drifted into the sea and sank into the surface of the ocean on his back.
At that time, Alberta was as hot as South Florida today, and probably the rivers and oceans were spreading more and more into the inside than they are now.
"Nodozor is really remarkable with its completely scaly-coated and preserved, but also with its original shape preserved in a 3-D way," Brown said.
' The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it does in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't need too much imagination to rebuild it; If you cut your eyes a little, you might even believe you're almost asleep. '
The kretase was the time when giant teropods, the meat-glutton dinosaurs, were on two legs, visited the earth.
Although they were all king, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armored dinosaur Borealopelta, which could have been hunted by a team of imposing ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 ft (11, 5m) long, 6 ton monster.
The latest findings in Current Biology magazine, scientists believe Borealopelta was dragged into the sea after death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in northern Alberta, Canada, in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray.
According to the museum, it's the best preserved armored dinosaur, including leather and armor, and it's full from nose to hip.
The creature averages approximately 18 ft. (five meters) and weighs 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
It has 2 20-inch horns that come out of its shoulders.
Researchers believe that this armored herb is currently wandering the cumbersome cumbersome place in Western Canada until it is dragged into the open sea by a river overflowing the onose.
But the tomb under the Sea of dinosaurs preserved its armour in perfect detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular species are so well preserved that the skin fragments still occupy the layers of armour of the dinosaur along the skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, this degree of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at him, the more unbelievable it gets.
Fossilized skin fragments are still covered by a layer of tumor armour, which is a dot in the dinosaur's skull.
His right anterior leg lies on his side, five fingers upward.
I can count stamps on the soles of the feet. "
Don't be out of your teeth when you say "whiten"
Pure white teeth and an aesthetic smile for every man's dream.
While people are applying to whiten their teeth, the head of the Association of Oral Laser Applications, Nükhet Berk, warns that products sold in the market or on the Internet should be kept away.
Sold the surface of the enamel of such substances, indicating that the teeth are colored in a way that will not be recycled, Nükhet Berk, "whitening teeth, chemical substances applied by dentists or the surface of the teeth is attached to the nail Can be provided with thin porcelain surfaces such as "he says.
Protection of dental health is preventing the formation of many diseases, aesthetic applications, both the health of the teeth and gum, and a good smile in terms of mental health is important to save Berk, the following information shares:
Young people's teeth are usually white unless there is a disorder or genetic factors in their dental structure.
Due to the frequent consumption of aging, tooth enamel and smoking, abrasive or dark beverages, the teeth get darker color over the years.
Whitening of teeth can be provided by the chemical substances applied by dentists or on the surface of the teeth with thin porcelain surfaces, such as false nails, which are applied without minimal or no abrasion.
Never bleach teeth with products sold in the market or on the Internet.
Because, these substances draw the surface of the enamel, the teeth will be colored so that no more recycling.
Keçiören Municipality, 2011 "To this side of the elderly, handicapped and bedridden citizens" home teeth and oral health service "gives.

"Seniority" event in Turkish army
Dear readers, at the High Military Council (age) meeting of the previous day, very interesting decisions were made especially for the Navy.
The commander of this force was not an admiral, but a Vice admiral.
It is an application that has never been seen in our army.
And how did that happen?
Force Commander, Admiral Bulent Bostanoğlu filled the duration, would have already retired...
And it happened.
Now the commander's turn was the only Admiral, Veysel Kösele.
Veysel Pasha, who was the victim of the past and was imprisoned for a while, was supposed to be a commander in the normal seniority rankings.
But the government didn't want him.
I'm trying to explain it in a nutshell, if we start at the top of the Marines, Commanders 1, 3, 4 and 5 have not been promoted.
In this case, there was only one admiral left in the Navy.
His discharge was supposed to be brought to the authority: Navy commander in Number two, Admiral Veysel Kösele.
And what happened next?
The sixth-place Vice Admiral Adnan Özbal was appointed by the government.
Now look at this table!
Admiral Veysel Kösele is standing there, but instead of being appointed a lower-ranking commander!
A senior is being put in the order of seniority.
I wonder what's going to happen next.
An admiral who is superior to his rank does not serve in the order of a Lieutenant general who is a junior.
He can't take orders from him.
In this case, Veysel Kösele will not tolerate this hurtful situation, if he is not retired today or tomorrow he'll resign.
This is the hurtful message given by the government: "Goodbye Veysel Pasha!"
Yesterday, when I wrote this article, the news that he resigned during the afternoon was spread, but the situation was not formally disclosed.
Now let's look at this again!
The government did not want to resign to Veysel Kösele for this reason or not, and forced the resignation and replaced the command with the sixth. He has brought in a next admiral to undermine the traditional "seniority" of our army.
There's always politics involved, and we don't know the backstage.
Maybe if someone tells us soon, we'll all learn together!
Dear readers, I tried to tell you very briefly above, especially in the Turkish army, seniority is very important.
Not just as a rank.
For example, the War School is 10. The officer who finished in line 11. It's more seniority than you finish.
He's more senior to the general than the second-place promotion.
We have experienced concrete examples of this seniority in Istiklal Harbinde.
The commander of the front of the Garp Ismet Pasha...
There are two armies at your disposal.
Army and 2nd. Army.
We have come to 1922, our armies will carry out the great offensive and fire the Greek Army.
There are valuable names that are expected to be assigned to military command at this stage.
One is the Pasha of Refet (Bele).
He is offered an army command, but he says, "Ismet is not mine, I cannot enter his order."
Another name is Yakup Şevki (Subaşı) Pasha.
His teacher at the War Academy of Atatürk...
He is a valued and senior commander who has been involved in various battles, which he loves, cares about, "Hodja".
In 1919, he was captured with military and civilian Turkish intellectuals and was driven to Malta by the British.
On his return to the dorm, he is reluctant to command the army and says the same things: "The Western Front commander is no less than me, I cannot take orders from him."
However, Atatürk convinces him to ask gratitude and Jacob Şevki Pasha accepts the command of one of our two armies.
The third is a very colorful name...
Ali Ihsan (Sabis) Pasha.
A highly-spoken, constantly criticizing soldier.
A commander who fought in Iraq, Caucasus, Iran and various fronts.
He is banished to Malta by the British, and he runs away from Kusadasi to Ankara.
Ali Ihsan Pasha said the same thing when he was offered an army command: "I cannot fight at the disposal of Ismet, which is the seniority of me"...
But it is being persuaded...
But the bride sees that, after the inauguration of the Mission, the commander of the front of the Garp, Ismet Pasha constantly discusses, raises a scene and makes the army uneasy...
And a short time before the big offensive, he was transferred to retirement, instead of the bearded Nurettin Pasha is brought.
After that, Ali Ihsan Pasha never recovered from Atatürk.
The problem of seniority in the Turkish army is not only in war, but also in peace.
Of course it should.
Sanjay Kodia This is the last example.
An activist had to learn the answer to the question, "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
The day after he came to New York City, he sat on the bed of the Airbnb rented by St. Louis and started surfing on his phone on Facebook.
It's a share of someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still lying on the street."
He was surprised to notice that no one else in the stream has shared this information, closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user named @TheePharoah nickname was repeatedly retweeting in his content stream.
The rapper from the St. Louis region was tweeting Michael Brown's death alive, 18 years old, an unarmed black man, killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He shared a photo of Brown's inanimate body in the street for 4 hours to stay there.
Ferrell thought to himself, "that's brutal."
But death was nothing new to him or his society.
He left his phone on the same evening at Canfield Drive to tweet about people gathering.
There were photographs of a man who claimed police bands, screaming people and Brown's father, holding a banner that says, "Ferguson P.D. just killed my unarmed son!"
A police officer watched a live broadcast with a dog barking in front of a group of protesters.
In another video, another cop said, he set the trigger on his rifle and shouted: "I'll kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembered that he said, "This is not customary."
"' This is not the kind of murder that we are accustomed to and is typical of. '
I felt the chill at that moment.
I was angry and I was crying. "
He reserved a return ticket and went home the next day.
After he landed at 11:00, he took his 6-year-old daughter from his father's house and decided to go with him to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years will come to cinemas on August 11th, a new documentary titled "Whose Streets?"
This; It's a story about survival and protest, from the point of view of people who love and loss, the power and the Resistance, who live in that community and fill the streets with answers they're looking for.
While Ferrell was driving to Ferguson with his daughter wearing a flower dress and wearing a suitable crown, they went back to talking about the experiences of blacks and the situation of the blacks that they had done many times before.
"Do you remember when I taught you that black people should fight for what they believe?"
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not true.
I couldn't have taken him. "said Ferrell later.
"What happened here today... is a consequence of what happened in the past.
He must know, see and grow in this.
It should not only be improved in the field of activism and organizing, but also to know the layers of the black experience and the black status and liberalisation, to know what we need to do for freeing ourselves.
If I were lucky enough to give him an experience he could not personally experience in vulgar racism, there will be no difference from any black woman-child.
I feel like I'm going to be doing him harm by protecting him from these. "
When they arrived at Ferguson, their first stop was the southern Florissant, who was in front of the police station and was waiting to talk to Officer Darren Wilson about the issue that resulted in the failure to commit a crime, a sort of camp area for activists. He was on his way.
There, Ferrell and his daughter contacted local business owners who prepared the packed food.
They prepared bags and helped deliver them to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually formed a new kind of activism.
When she was a student at the Missouri State University, she was the head of the Minority Students Nurses ' Association and appeared to focus on food justice and injustice in health in the black community, "my activiance was completely transformed after 9 August."
"I had no experience in organizing.
It came by itself. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors at an evening screening.
Folayan said he and his own cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what was happening.
Ferrell came up with a question: "Do you want to document it or are you trying to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism was often reported by people in countless cases, including whites; To come to a society and ensure that it comes out of its pain and resilience...
"We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not concentrated, and we decided to do it in a different way," said Folayan in a recent interview.
Folayan has already contacted the regional artist co-director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism for the death penalty prisoners.
His involvement made Ferrell warm up the project, along with six other local locals, and the "Whose streets?" Team watched it in the years after Brown was shot.
David said, "This is not a documentary that someone is talking to us or talking to. We're the ones talking. "
"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I'm represented."
"The goal is not to focus on the experiences of Ferrell, but the move is about" The fact that Christ is not about a leader, it is about community reunion, "he said, proving that the film participants were the most vulnerable.
As a result, "Whose streets?" Surprisingly, in love and marrying his wife, he documents the personal aspects of Ferrell's life.
The first view of the finished product Smiley Ferrell, "I felt like naked," he said.
"But while I was doing this and humanizing black people, I knew there might be some tenderness."
In addition, Ferrell's story reinforces the role of black gay women in the black Lives Matter movement and puts it back in the center.
After the murder of the black young Trayvon Martin in 2012, two of the three founders of the #BlackLivesMatter slogan, the social media, describe themselves as homosexuals.
"Black gay women in leadership have kept the movement in general," said Ferrell, "and this is our constant war on many fronts.
Black gay women have to carry all the weight of it. "
Folayan joined it, noting: "The move is really being held by black women and many gay black women."
Nevertheless, Ferrell insists that "when there is nothing in the kind of affirptable action," and that he is not chosen for his identity.
He says, "he was the one who triggered this energy."
"But it's not a coincidence that he's on the front line, because as a black gay woman, there's a lot of things you'll lose to live a life at these crossovers.
You can feel his energy on the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras are already gone at Ferguson, but there are alarming racial connections between the community and the police.
Ferrell is under surveillance for 2.5 years due to close the motorway during a demonstration.
The socio-political atmosphere in the area he calls home is simply "chaos."
Nevertheless, Ferguson is holding the song he was digging into his memory three years ago, when he was on his streets.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our job to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains. "
Kyrie Irving: The world is not straight round!
"The world is not round," Irving told NBC Sports.
The world is flat.
They're getting used to these things by giving people fear.
Oh, man, don't question too much.
Because the more information you solve, the more knowledge comes out.
This is crazy.
Is the world flat?
Or does it revolve around itself in a round way?
I think you should investigate this matter.
I'm telling you, they're lying to our faces.
They're lying to us! He used his words.
"I believed that I wanted to believe for years."
I thought the world was round and back.
You really think we're back in the solar system?
Nothing they send is coming back.
He's not coming back!
The information they gave us is very inconsistent.
The truth is here.
You should just call this truth.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?" he said.
Kyrie Irving, who claims to be flat in the world, is struggling with the Cleveland Cavaliers for the 24.4 issue and 5.9 assists averages this season.
A proper resemblance: The artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits.
In the middle of the room at the New York Fridman Gallery, White, black and brown, surrounded by wires on the ceiling, there are many faces, each of which is almost vaguely similar to each other.
These 30 portrait artists were created by Heather Dewey-hagborg, with her earsticks and trimmed hair sent by Chelsea Manning.
As it is known, after leaking classified diplomatic messages through the WikiLeaks site, former intelligence analyst Manning, who suffered 35 years of detention, sent his severed hair from Fort Leavenworth Prison.
The new exhibition, opened on August 2, is a proper resemblance.
This is between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines his discipline with expertise in technology, computer science and art, to the end of the three-day sentence between a trans-woman and a prominent dissident, Manning, forgiven by Barack Obama, two It's a product of the annual correspondence.
Dewey-Hagborg, who created 30 portraits by using algorithmically analyzed DNA extracted from Manning and what a person with this gene data might look like, is the only way to interpret the workability of a DNA database (there are many ways that can be interpreted and The determinism from the essence of the interpretations), but also the identity of the firm, perhaps a somewhat cerebral interpretation revealed.
Born as Bradley Edward, but more openly in adolescence, Manning identified himself as a woman, convicted of 20 crimes in 2013, including six in the Espionage Act, computer counterfeits and theft.
His image was pressured by the prison, so that there was only one photo: a sandy, black and white selfie that Manning was apparently agitated in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum-yellow wig that was self-conscious.
In 2015, Dewey-hagborg was successful in its 2012 project with the enormous surprise of the weirdest of the Önseziler.
In this, the artist produced portraits by filtering out DNA from the rash of forensic parts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum to take a picture of what these people might look like.
In the meantime, he received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-hagborg, at the press preview of the new exhibit.
In the meantime, he couldn't visit, and he couldn't take the photo, so they reached Chelsea and asked if he was interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned inspiration became unexpected pen pals by exchanging many letters over the course of two years.
They even unearthed the suppressed Imgeler, a caricature of a future where the president has forgiven Chelsea's punishment and can see the exhibition personally, which is the illustrator of the Shoili Lawgo.
Obama really wanted Manning released a few days after the book was released, a kind of happy coincidence after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump finds new, tweetable ways to fumilate government-related information and to inflame the sharp divisions that the transgender soldiers have been asked to repair and fix, it is a profound and powerful thing about this exhibition that is currently being opened Have.
When asked about the bizarre timing of all this, Dewey-hagborg said, "Things happen for a reason."
The statement of an artist written on the wall of the gallery, which is under the signature of Manning's enormous size (the point of the letter "I" in the Heart), "Gender, race, sexuality and culture based on the" automatic discrimination "call for the end He was.
Across the wall is his mitochondrial DNA sequence: Many C's, G's and A's are written in pencil...
By including the 200 letter (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey hagborg wanted to tell us, at least as a biological creation, how amazingly we are alike.
"What I hope to get out of this is that the genome does not care about who we are and how the genetic data is open to interpretation, how subjective it is," he said in 2007, Dewey-Hagborg, whose video business was being exhibited.
"DNA data can tell a lot of different stories, and that's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in an exhibition held in a single room is a page from a previously mentioned short comic book.
Here, Manning shows up with a loudspeaker from the United States Disciplinary Barracks, King Kong style.
It says, "Do they silence your speech or win?"
"So never shut up."
"This came directly from a letter he wrote to me," the artist from Philadelphia said.
"I'm still getting goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibit (as it was quite predicted from the comic book), but when he sees it, he will be greeted by masks with his own genetic imitations gathered in the middle of the room like a group of protesters.
Like everything else in the exhibit, the genetic haplogis written in pencil, up to Manning's longitudinal (5 "2, Manning's height), which was specifically done.
Dewey-Hagborg said, "In the past, I put them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd."
"I wanted it to be perceived as a collective move with Chelsea, which is like the movement behind her emancipation."
Northwestern Training Officer and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
Police said that after being stabbed to death in a luxury apartment building in Chicago, a nationwide manhunt was initiated for a fellow Northwestern University training officer and Oxford University employee who was wanted as a suspect.
Cook administration zone Records; On Monday, the arrest for the first-degree murder of the Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for allegedly taking part in the killing of the museum shows that the arrests were removed.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died many times after being stabbed.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said a body was found on July 27th.
The officers received a call, reached the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with many deep cuts in his body.
Official sources said that Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene, and that the police were investigating the stabbing as a homicide while actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been an associate professor at Northwestern University in Microbiology and immunology since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, a vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is in administrative leave and is prohibited from entering Northwestern university campuses.
"This is a criminal case under investigation by the necessary authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
"We are in contact with the United Kingdom police and we are ready to assist the US investigation authorities in any way they need," the university and a spokesman at Somerville University said in an e-mail statement.
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted to surrender.
Communications chief of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly encouraged the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but our efforts to identify it are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who had just received a mysterious clue that something had occurred in apartment 1008.
The police identified the scene as terrible.
Guglielmi said it was not clear whether the incident was on July 27th.
He said that Lathem and Warren were in the building verifying the security cameras.
Guglielmi, "We believe that faculty member Latham and the victim are having an affair," he said.
The executive staff at Grand Plaza issued a statement saying to residents: "Police are still working on the victim's timeline and background, and are investigating a series of activities, including a possible domestic incident."
Italy seized German ship
Italian police, asylum seekers in the middle Mediterranean search and rescue activities in the ship called Iuventa, yesterday announced that the island of Lampedusa was confiscated.
The police, who share the records of the phone conversations that he claimed to be belonging to two members of the organization, announced that this operation was carried out under the investigation initiated by the Trapani prosecution in October 2016.
"They also operate in favour of illegal immigration in the Libyan-Italy line," The Jugend Rettet members say, at least 3 times, that they brought asylum seekers from the boats of Libyan people directly to Itali.
Jugend Rettet, who was questioned by the prosecutor's office, also claims that they committed this crime with some people from the Libyan coast Guard.
In a statement from the organization, the priorities of the human life will continue to save, stating that they are evaluating the accusations against them.
In addition to the ships covered by the Italy Coast Guard and the European Union (EU) mission, nearly 9 international NGOs are also serving in the search-rescue of asylum seekers in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government has drafted a code of conduct for 13 articles to accommodate these organizations and stipulated that it should be signed.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will complete the WADA road map in the short term"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said the Russian anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will not take a long time to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) benchmarks to become operational again.
"A certain stage was completed in fulfilling the roadmap criteria, RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA road map has been updated in this context. "said Mutko on Thursday.
The Prime Minister was evaluating the second part of the WADA Regulation Compliance Roadmap, which recently published on the institution's website, describing the criteria governing the rework of RUSADA.
According to Mutko, this does not involve anything that would concern Russia.
"Everything is announced, all will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future, "he added.
But there is a criterion mentioned on the list; Russia's anti-doping authorities are obliged to publicly accept the reported results of the alleged state-sponsored doping investigation in Russian sports by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, endorsed by WADA .
Mutko cited the subject as saying: "Our anti-doping system is accepting a failure, and we are conducting the investigation.
All measures were applied.
But there is no state program and we will not accept something that has not existed. "
Mutko's remarks repeat the president of the Russian independent public Anti-Doping commission, Vitaly Smirnov.
Speaking to the Russian broadcaster Rsport earlier in the day, Smirnov acknowledged the past problems in the Russian anti-doping organs, but added: "We have said many occasions that the report contains contrasting positions and arrangements.
No one is considering accepting the report unconditionally, "he added, Smirnov.
In November 2005, Rusada was suspended by WADA to perform doping checks in Russia following the doping scandal.
This June test planning and coordination was allowed under the supervision of international experts and the United Kingdom Anti-Doping (UKAD).
In July, after a visit to the institution's headquarters in Moscow, WADA director Olivier Niggli announced that Rusada "has progressing in the right direction" to become reworked.

It will be 9 million with bonuses not 7.5 million!
You have already invested a great deal, of course you will play and 7.5 9...
Uzbek acts: I do not want to criticize.
But the situation is clear.
G. Palace values are eroded.
It's not just football, it's all wrong approach.
This will change the Council board and the General Assembly.
But I understand the members are satisfied!
Start-ups that will help your company not be the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure her happiness in e-commerce start-up, but the polls weren't working.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful, or even worse, deceptive.
Some employees did not trust the process, even if they were to commit anonymiality.
Errett, who manages a 75 e-commerce company, Madison Reed, on hair care in San Francisco, says "there was never any amount or objectivity."
He called someone outside for help.
A new kind of human resources are emerging to help companies understand how their employees feel.
These are; The specific purpose is to produce a software that measures employees ' busy work and licenses it by licensing companies to perform instant-choice surveys, targeting specific teams and demographic groups, anonymity and complaint assistance lines to employees And in some cases, by bypassing top executives and by going directly to the board of directors, they allow employees to be notified.
"Now there are tools that monitor your health, such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is your company's Fitbit," said the co-founder and president of Redwood City Start-up glint, who measured the busy employees of software analysis tools companies. Spoke.
Using glint, Errett says he understands what his employees think and feel better three years later.
In addition to providing instant surveys and choice questionnaires to specific teams, it offers a heat map in which parts of the company have received the most complaints and a glimpse of which manager has low rating points; So they can be tampered with.
To not be the next Uber, companies are beginning to understand that they need to learn about the culture of the workplaces; Uber has been in a scandal since describing a harassment environment where a former employee has been punished by those who clearly say what they think in a blog post.
For start-ups like glint, this surveillance request means a very profitable business opportunity.
According to the Financial Technology Insights Web site Let's Talk Payments, the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry may be worth 118.7 billion by 2020.
The interest and effectiveness of the Denver Colorado-based start-up convercent, which helps companies detect and prevent bad behaviour, has increased among the discussions of Uber's disrepudiation earlier this year.
Convercent has close to 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Convercent, like glint, allows companies to perform personalized "pulse" surveys, collect real-time secret responses, and extract heat maps of problematic areas.
It also offers a helpline of anonymous messages, where employees can report bad behaviour.
If the president is accused, the complaints go directly to the board of directors.
Covercent's founder and president, Patrick Quinlan, said, "the public court has seized the regulators".
Quinlan said: If a company is not behaving poorly or ethically in its employees, even if regulators do not engage, consumer boycotts may face costly consequences due to employee casualties or cases.
With more than 25,000 employees at 500, restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday has been using convercent for over a year to make sure that their employees are aware of the principles and procedures and that they can easily reach the corporate headquarters.
If a previous employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or email belonging to the company headquarters, had a formal complaint, and hoped that it would be taken seriously.
James Vitrano, chief legal counsel for Ruby Tuesday, said that these are mostly intimidating and disturbing experiences, not a good way to track employee complaints.
But now that the company is using convercent, the problems that have previously been hidden from managers who have been sitting at the distances of office, city or state (such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair salary application) can be detected and solved faster.
"I can approach this employment experience with a holistic, 360-degree perspective," said Vitrano, who manages Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"We also protect our shareholders from business cases."
In 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen sank due to a violation of the ethical values arising from the Enron scandal, companies discussed ethics, values and relationship with the employee more seriously in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after "social media has come to itself," the firms realized that their dirty laundry would not be viral.
"Before using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
They offer both the glint and convercent Software as a service, and they receive recurring fees for the use of their products.
This is a business model and opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who support both start-ups.
Convercent; He received $10m in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and 47 million in total capital.
Glint, Bessemer Venture Partners, has provided $10 million in my muscle and 60 million in total funding.
These investments are not surprising, given the companies ' inherent, culture and risk capital.
The increasing amount of research shows that today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only the minimum requirements.
Employees want to feel they are accepted, valued and giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
The global benefits and employee experience of Linkedın, which uses both convercent and glint, said Nina McQueen: "When people are happy to be in a company, when they feel their voices are heard and their work is satisfactory, They're more sincere to make that company successful. "
Investors gain earnings when their portfolio companies are doing well; Companies do good work if they feel their employees are internal and company.
If the third party analysis tools are promising to increase the sincerity and the feeling of belonging to employees, it is not surprising that they find support.
It is important for workplace culture experts to have data on employee loyalty.
But the data is useless if the company's principals don't move.
In fact, if a company wants feedback from its employees, it can create an expectation that the change is coming.
And if the expectation doesn't come fast enough or at all, it can be disappointing and make the employees feel like they're broken.
"You will want 4000 proposals, you need to be prepared to talk 4000," said Russell Raath, who is the head of consulting at the Business management company Kotter International and has made the mistake of firms to trust the data collection too much.
' Cause if you don't follow, the employees will think, ' Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't give a damn, why should I care? "
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who conducted monthly employee surveys, was able to act on the same day when a problem was reported at Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees who are tired of the decision-making mechanism and the speed of communication quality, the company has been able to reorganize various teams and add communication training to solve the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is receiving new insights into its own employees and hopes that it will become more workers in this kind of industry, known to have a high number of employee input outputs in the long run.
"If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose people."
"And if you lose people, you lose the customers.
And when you lose customers, you will lose the companies. "
It's a long day for Bruins for the NCAA to lift two trainings every day.
It's 11 o'clock at night, and a mob of UCLA football players hang out to chat on a side of the new training course on campus.
Some of them grazed the tops of their jersey, revealing their slippery ridges from the sweat of the first day in the training camp.
For an important part of the team, these idle minutes are the midday break.
After 3 hours of practice, players enrolled in the summer classes will return to their dormitories and work the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6.30 next morning.
"The next three days are a grind for these men," said Bruins coach Jim Mora, just before he returned to Tuesday.
The NCAA's lifting two workouts a day, at least until the finals end on Friday, held to raise the burden on the players, in fact, extended their days.
That's why UCLA's first three trainings were programmed to begin at 7.15 in the evening, adapting to the already congested schedule of the players.
It's more than a day's practice for not having two workouts daily; Bruins takes a week close to the start of the camp last season, and during the summer school, he is training for the first time in summer school during the six seasons of Mora in Westwood.
In September, they are planning to practice 18 until August 20th, before they start their official match for their inauguration against Texas A&M.
Although Mora added new pens to the players ' intensive work program, he said the NCAA supports the change of rules.
Mora said, "for three or four days we put a huge burden on them and it's very compelling."
"And they have recently passed; They're working, terrific guys.
I think we'll have more time when we get to Saturday, it's going to be really great. "
UCLA will stop their training when the camp is over; The luxury hotel Luskin Center, which is held on the side of the car park and adjacent football, and closes the back of the castle with a protective net, is not easy to work with when considering the area of the line of sight.
Bruins players are scheduled to arrive at the hotel from the beginning of this week, but Mora admits that there may be a problem with the ejaculation of these rooms during the season.
Mora said, "We'll have security."
"This is a real concern, and it's not too cold to think that someone would rent a room and sit there and videotape a workout.
If there's a video recording of a workout, it's a pretty good thing.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security at parking lot 8.
We'll do our best with what we have.
I'm not going to worry too much about this.
We have a plan. "
Facebook boosts your story verification power to fight against fake news
Facebook will send more potential counterfeit articles to third party story validators and show their findings under the original share; The world's largest online social network on Thursday told us to try to fight against the false news called.
In a statement on the company's website, they will use updated machine learning to identify potential fraud and send them to story validators, and potentially make the results of the story validation in the original article He said he'd show it underneath.
Facebook is criticised for being one of the main distribution points of the news, which many of them have heard as false news that they think influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
If French voters fail to flood the false news before the presidential election in May, and Germany fails to quickly remove hate shares on social media networks before the elections in September, the criminal plan The problem has become a major political title in Europe.
A separate statement from Facebook on Thursday said that a test of the new story validation feature is being initiated in the US, France, Holland and Germany.
Facebook News Feed Product manager Sara Su said in a blog: "In addition to seeing which stories were discussed by third party story validators, people read and share more about their knowledge based decisions He wants a source. "
Facebook will continue to test the "related article" feature, adding that it would work on other changes in the news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating comics: The Story of a fortress in England
His recent past was a tiny Scotney castle, a Squeeze music video, and a refuge for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 and 1980s.
But right now; Inspired by a comic book written by a Yorkshire, Jamie Rhodes, who was obsessed with brooding, historic documents, Scotney witnessed a 700-year-old turbulent history from the cozy seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent.
"I find it very nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says.
"How to keep this letter in my hand is a personal connection."
A fortress in England extending from the age of Edward to the Middle Ages, each story lived in Scotney to be portrayed by a different artist (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg) from the United Kingdom They're documencking their families.
This is not the first book of Rhodes to be based on an archive: He also wrote the teeth and other stories of dead men in 2014, a project that was found unexpectedly emotional, inspired by stories in the British Library.
"My eyes are full of fingerprints on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the King James fans."
"That was the mark of his thumb!
And the letters always stink, because then you'd have a fire for the light.
For someone in the future 300 years, this smell feels like it's there.
Oh, I love archives! "
As someone in love with the old papers, the National Trust and the British Arts Council to get support and stay in a castle for almost four months ("to be honest, I've been a little over-paid to be warmly welcomed.") seems too good.
Rhodes spent days exploring the Victorian "new" fortress, scanning archives and working with many treasures and antiques, such as bottles spent centuries in hyena heads and trenches mounted on the walls of the mansion.
He traveled the lands and ruins of the old fortress by talking to the Rangers, the gardeners, and sometimes the artists working on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he'd drink whiskey and write.
The detailed history of Scotney is a relatively unknown, as National Trust can reach full access only when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had begun to address the archive, which he described as saying: "For centuries, the aristocrats of the year said: ' Oh, throw it in the attic '."
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps that determine the boundaries of who has what: "You think that territorial disputes will be boring," said Rhodes, "but there was a birch that two families fought over.
Forget it, guys! "
Some stories in the collection, including the labourer, who left the newly built castle to join the peasant rebellion in 1381, are using the castle as a jump point to make a wider entrance to the British history.
"In this book called The Knights Families of Kent and Sussex, there is a record of a revolt in the castle in 1380," says Rhodes.
"The peasant rebellion began in this vicinity, and I thought that a rebellion could be a good starting point.
Maybe these two might be connected? "
Other stories are tightly linked to the history of the castle, for example the Priest who tells the story of the Darrell family who hid a Jesuit pastor for seven years during the British detention.
Or a coffin filled with rocks and a funeral of 18. The smuggler, featuring the century Dodger Arthut Darrell, is a disclosure that has been removed from the land after years.
The Darrell's favorite Scotney family of Rhodes: "These gentlemen seemed pretty tricky, they were always in debt, and they were spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell's men resolved their debt crisis by marrying rich old women; I imagine them as a group of handsome men who are capable of courtship to female heirs. "
The mission in the castle, Rhodes, seeks other singular writing experiences.
Fin has completed a two-week job for a comic book about Elämänmäki, who has been repossessed by nature since then, which is the field of a sanatorium in the early 20th century.
But Scotney keeps a separate place in his heart.
He says, "I'm sorry I left."
"It's like: ' Oh, now I have to go and confront his real life. ' "
Meral Akşener'e ' response to Maho
Nationalist Movement Party Secretary-General Ismet Büyükataman, the MHP in recent days related to the social media and the press made a written statement on the allegations of resignation.
Büyükataman, social media and "some of the corners of the old rifle Marxists" MHP "hatred flows" by using the expression, "the ultraneous movement of the game and stalls to prevent the survival of the MHP under the umbrella of September 12 after the move is applied" He suggested it.
Büyükataman, said:
"The history of the Turkish nation does not digest the existence of the Turkish people, the country is corrupt, the record is corrupted, the criminal file is fluffy, the idea is blurred, if the mind is confused, rubbing his hands."
"Now they have left" MHP Kocaeli Gölcük District Organization administration and members of 410 people and MHP Bursa's Yenişehir District 215 people resigned ".
250 resignation, 300 resignation, as well as unfounded news is misguided public opinion.
In the newspaper columns, lie has been overlying, deception deepened.
As there is no resignation in this issue, the number of müstafs in the mentioned places does not exceed the fingers of one hand.
"So-called" in the "alleged" of the resignation, Büyükataman, again, "supposedly," the polls that the public was trying to mislead and perception management, he said.
"They will reverse propaganda and campaigns facing the MHP to create perceptions," Büyükataman said.
MHP's Turkish politics is an important and indispensable actor voicing MHP general Secretary Büyükataman, said the following about resignations:
The power of the old Marxists is not enough to destroy the place the MHP has acquired in the conscience of the Turkish nation.
A dirty account lies behind all the interpretations of the applied perception management methods.
Because politics and the media, the MHP has planted its eye.
When we are among us, none of the good work and effort in favor of our party, but now to resign, does not make any sense.
Those who have not been able to benefit from our party in the account of the generations have resigned what GAM?
The MHP in their lives did not touch, share our memories, our ideals did not understand, participated in our struggle, even if joined in the side of the mind charred mentality, the heart-stoned mob should find other busy themselves.
The pursuit of the nationalist Movement Party's efforts to remove the unity and integrity, the quest for controversy and factions is a vain effort.
And he's going to turn around and hit the owner.
The nationalist movement is the last fortress of the Turkish nation standing upright despite heavy destruction.
In his statement, "political counterfeiters" for those who have suggested that he was aiming for the MHP, Büyükataman, who said "politically snatchers", "the nationalist movement is not unpossessed."
"The root of the ocean-fed roots will not reach their goal no matter what the price of the outside the inside."
"The traitors of the collar will go berserk and ashes in the fire of the discord," said the MHP Büyükataman, a combination of opposition parties and terrorist groups in the statement, the following allegations: "The CHP's Hdp'dan; From there to the Perinczegias, the PKK to the fetö"who do whatever they do, the Turkish nation will not operate the right to have their own destiny."
Yesterday Turkes "You MHP, MHP without the new tactics and games of the Turkish Planans resied; MHP without the government, MHP without the Council of the bastards who wanted to fight to the end.
Now we're going to break the games, we'll ruin the actors.
"The patent is in the MHP," said Büyükataman, said Meral Akşener'i, referring to the following statements: "Like the movie Banker Bilo, a former green pine made, Maho villagers will take you to Germany, for days after browsing the truck safe How is it that if they left Istanbul on a mountain slope, it is obvious that they will leave you to the edge of the cliff, saying that they are taking you to power. "
It's their issue, but the only thing we ask of these disciples is that they're new to where they went.
Kjaer signed Sevilla
Yellow-Lacivertli team 12.5 million euros in the transfer to Seville, and the Spanish team's most expensive defense transfer to date Kjaer signed the official contract.
The Danish star is going to wear the number four jersey in Seville.
Great ease of Turkish Airlines to families with baby
According to the Turkish Airlines press consultancy, the national airline, which prioritizes the flight comfort and satisfaction of its passengers and tries to feel more comfortable throughout the flight, new ideas for an excellent travel experience continues to develop.
In this direction, the needs of infants and their families between the ages of 0-2, prepared by examining the "Baby travel kit", starting from August to be offered to passengers traveling on flights between continents.
In the kit prepared with a specially designed bag; There is a replacement cover, disposable bib, diaper rash, baby lotion and shampoo, newborn wet cotton wipes and breast pads.
Paraben, alcohol, dyes and products that do not contain harmful chemicals, the sensitivity of the baby's skin was produced with consideration.
Washington changes the Green Card rules
According to the media, President Donald Trump said there would be a new US immigrant plan that changes the Green Card rules.
It predicts legal immigrants to reduce to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for temporary work permits, and restrictions for family visas.
The new rules were offered by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in both wings of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise salaries and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the United States is giving Green cards to other nationals.
The law will reduce the chain migration and replace the current regime.
This new application process will help English-speaking candidates who have the ability to benefit from self-sufficient financial resources and our economy. "The American media quoted Trump as saying.
The authors commented on the match of Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz
Two seasons, I can not find, I can not see the enthusiasm and needs glamour had regained Kadikoy...
Aykut Kocaman In the absence of a "barbecued" team, the supporters of the "stand behind" agreement to make the field.
We can bring criticism to your game, positions or performances, but I haven't seen a game that's been going on and on for a long time.
He made the first game, but yesterday he wore his epauletto his shoulder; Fenerbahce's commander in the field is now Valbuena.
His age was a problem when he was transferred, but he had the phrase "character not giving up" in his words.
30 years ago we gave the name of the Atom Ant to Reza Çalımbay.
If it does, the French player will be the most worthy interpretation.
It was all over the field, participating in all the rust organizations, always taking responsibility and scoring a huge show in short length.
Alper's play in the lead, the second striker to remain in position Sturm Graz has left the team "restricted" for a long time.
Fenerbahce Circuit is closing the winner of the Korner, the continuous formula to overcome such a hard wall searched.
They dominate the ball, but they cannot produce rust effectively in the field of competing penalties.
This image may bring the "power plant" interpretation, but we are faced with a game that cannot put the position of the only power plant in his hand that hesitates to pass to Ahmethan.
Either the team didn't trust the young player, or his performance needs to evolve a little further.
After the score was 1-1, they couldn't take advantage of the two clear opportunities.
It was important to pass the tour, but it would make the night more beautiful to stand up for the player's struggle, "goal".
There will probably be more than 1-2 new transfers by Monday.
But the truth is that Fenerbahce's biggest need is number 12...
We are on the verge of a very glittering and enjoyable season with this game style that carries the heart of the grandstand that tries to play ahead.
Aykut Kocaman's machine is drying the zembere, it needs more time.
They're in good physical condition.
The game quality will also develop.
You see clearly that all players in the field have increased confidence.
They need a lot of applause for a new page last night.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be concerned
Just when you think that 2017 years can't get any weirder, there's a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot industry.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Institute (FRR) published a report looking at the development of sex robots within the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
Mr. Sharkey said about the publication of the new report: "People are laughing at them, but the companies are actually a lot of love and we will see them even more."
Modern Sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin that is hot to touch from inflatable alike, especially human reactions performed by artificial intelligence.
Users can also personalize their robots to fit their own blood by choosing everything from the eye color, nipple shape and nail type or color of the robot.
But with the fact that many robots have "personalities" to show a Stepford woman innovative, it gets even more disturbing.
Modern Sex dolls evolved into silicon-skinned robots.
For example, the Realbotix robot allows its users to personalize their robots based on the characteristics of the character they find attractive (such as shyness).
Then there are roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, that come with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah" and "adventurous" personality and "wild Wendy," which gives the impression of shyness.
True Companion's website is being counched: "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that matches your personality as much as possible."
So you love what you love, what you don't like, and so on.
They also have moods in the day like real people.
She can be sleepy, eager to talk, or "in full mode."
There are many disturbing sides to the rise of sex robots: not only to replace real human relationships, but rather submissive female personality traits, and the most thought-provoking connotations of frigid Farah approaching.
True Companion on the website makes Roxxxy look like a vibrator, but for men.
"If the woman can have a vibrator (just like that in the text), why not the men's Roxxxy?" website.
But these sex robots are not just a fetish or sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper within our culture, an optional add-on from gender equality ideal, and a retreat to the desire for sex through subjugation.
Many men will not naturally have sex robots, and while FRR has attracted attention to their growing popularity, they are now in the outer wall of consumer culture.
But those who infiltrate the extremes can be highly instructive about the progression of the period we are experiencing.
Many people are not strange or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be.
It's not a coincidence that this sophisticated sex robot has emerged at a time when women's rights are threatened around the world, with a president who is praised for sexually assaulting women in the White House.
The most creepy part of the Handmaid's Tale TV series is the depictions that show all the details, not the noseled corpses or the carved eyes, but how realistic the image feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but it doesn't feel like a very big change right now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as many physical similarities as possible to real women (of course, in the proportion of pornographic film stars) as technologically feasible.
They want the creators to give them a sense of human touch and imitate the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personalities," robots don't clearly represent real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
They have no activities or past stories, nothing to reveal their independence or disrupt their total slavery fantasy.
In other words, they are the slaves that give pleasure.
Or the term 2017: courtesan.
American military convoy attack: There are dead and wounded...
A suicide attack in the Karabakh district of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, was aimed at foreign military forces operating in the country.
1 NATO soldier and 3 civilians lost their lives in the explosion, including wounded, the wounded 5 "of the Convoy of American soldiers and 1" was announced that the translator working with NATO forces.
NATO support forces in Afghanistan (Resolute Support), the NATO forces in a joint patrol with the Afghan National Army, said the suicide bomber detonates the homemade explosive.
The injured staff were treated at Bagram Airport's American military hospital.
The wounded are not in danger of life.
Local media said the suicide bomber was a member of the Taliban.
Trump's great skill?
To make Mitt Romney look like a common sense.
The micro-scale families of the political divide, which polarized the US voters, became the reality of the Trump period.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the US newspapers were full of how to deal with the nightmare of relatives who voted for Trump.
We all strive to detonate our own filtering bubbles.
The power to bring Trump's families together if it's less spoken.
I'm referring to that because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago who's broken up with Republicans in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
It reminded me that joining a common enemy could have a strong impact.
Everyone he knows, including the Republican brother Trump has been arguing about politics with in the White House for decades, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
At the dinner table this is of course a good thing; But it seems to me that in a broad context, these are important risks.
The left was played by Trump, but the bending effect of his presidency created the power to push right for all of me.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're talking about the terrible possibility that one day his bizarre behaviour may no longer be shocking.
There's even a more terrifying long-term scenario where Trump is "normalising" right-wing Republicans who oppose their own standards, and they suddenly seem to be the symbol of reason.
I find myself living nostalgic about the bizarre version of Mitt Romney's madness: Dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax refund looked like), which is both according to Trump. Really light crimes.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate has to be just sane to assess the immeasurable progress.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of all the carousel run by the New York Parks Department, and the best three bucks you could spend in town if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs in the central cylinder (all the clowns who make weird faces and the animals have returned to look fearfully behind their shoulders) and strumming music are strangely enthusiastic.
In other words, the many clichments of a city can be disappointing: the landscapes of the tall buildings start to get boring, the skyline begins to become too exciting to make too much excitement, and the reality of the city does not reach its duchess.
It's been thirty-five years, and I still haven't been able to overcome the day I discovered that Swiss Cottage is actually a large revolving junction in north London (not counted as the themed bar Ye Olde Swiss Cottage) but not a Switzerland country house.
But the carousel in Central Park is still oddly magical, a two-year-old person, two-year-olds, and two women in their 40s, and they can all have a great time.
If I could give a note to the carousel, I'd give him a full note, but fortunately, no one asked.
On the other hand, I was asked to evaluate my "experience" between 1 and 5 stars before I spent my credit card on a bonmarin this week.
The same thing in the coffee shop at the corner of my street, and the option to match the note with a 15% tip; For anything purchased from the bench...
The effect of this is not only slowing down what is supposed to be a neutral shop, but also pressure on the server to give a personality to an event that is not needed.
While the poor woman in the bonmarin was standing there smiling like an apology, I gave her five stars for my experience of giving credit cards to her hand in boredom.
They wore swimsuits when the temperature passed 41 degrees.
In Tunceli, where one of the hottest days of the season was experienced, the people flocked to the beaches of Munzur.
The young, children, elderly, men and women who entered the beaches on the side of Munzur Creek, with the heat pressed thoroughly from the noon hours, tried to be protected from the heat by cooling off in icy waters.
Especially in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and Britain, the Tunisian citizens living in the Aegean or the Mediterranean, instead of spending their holidays in their homeland, the beaches on the edge of the Munzur tea was filled.
Munzur Beach Among the coolers, Suna Tosun, the western provinces for the holidays, instead of the preference of Tunceli, stating that he said, "I did not want to spend my holiday in the West in the family, to cool down in Munzur, to stay in our own land was more accurate."
"The icy water of Munzur is nowhere in the world, and at these temperatures it makes us cool."
Hasan Ulu, who came from Germany, said they preferred the shore of Munzur River in Tunceli instead of fountains or Bodrum beaches, and therefore they do not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pains
That's the second time Pistorius left prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital to treat the lacerations on his wrists that the prison authorities said occurred after he fell in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an objection to the previous accidental manslaughter decision by prosecutors.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day, 2013, he killed Steenkamp in his home in Pretoria, firing repeatedly at the door of a toilet stall.

Last words ' I think I'm dying, Goodbye Mom '
Between the deaths of the Grenfell Tower Fire in London, which has been described as 30 so far, he called his mother at the time of the fire, "I don't want to die, mom, it's not fair."
"Thank you for everything you've done for me, farewell," said the Italian Gloria Trevisan and her boyfriend.
Dozens of people who were not notified after the fire included Gloria Trevisan, 26, and her Italian lover Marco Gottardi, sitting on the 23rd floor of the 24-storey building.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer for the Trevisan family living in the north of Italy, announced that, according to information from the British authorities, the two young people lost their lives.
Expressing that the families of young people are experiencing a great pain, the lawyer asked reporters not to insist on this issue.
I think I'm dying, bye mom.
Lawyer Sandri, Gloria, shortly after the launch of the fire, his mother, Emanuela Trevisan, said that he was looking for his cell phone, and the last time the mother listened to these conversations, he cried.
According to this, Gloria Trevisan spoke with her mother several times during the 2 hours after the fire, which started around 01.00 local time.
In his first speeches, said Trevisan, "mother, bad things are happening here, the fire came out."
We're stuck, we can't get out.
There's some smoke, but don't worry, we're waiting to be rescued.
"We tried to leave the door open, but there was too much smoke and the elevator didn't work," he said.
The last words of Gloria Trevisan, who increased their worries in the next searches with the growth of the fire, were quoted as follows:
Mom, my whole life has been passing before my eyes.
I think I'm dying.
I had a life to live in. That's not fair.
I don't want to die, and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I can't hug you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me, farewell, mother.
I'm going to heaven now and I'm going to help you out.
This is the Italy government's fault
Both Gloria Trevisan and Her lover Marco Gottardi, who studied architecture, were forced to find work after graduating last year, and moved to London in March from the Veneto region in the north of the country.
Gloria Trevisan, who had only been able to find a job in his country with a salary of 300 euros, had begun to work in London in a short period of time with 1800 pounds (approx. 2060 euros).
"Gloria has gone to London to help her family," said lawyer Sandri, saying Gloria Trevisan's family had a hard time financially.
Unfortunately, our young are forced to leave the country to save their future and find a job.
"The government should find a solution to this problem immediately," he said.
The drama of Italy, which cannot provide employment opportunities for their young
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, also expressed his rage, "This is the fault of our government, which forced our youth to flee abroad to find a job."
In Italy, the unemployment rate reaches 12 percent, while the proportion between youth is 40 percent.
Over the past few years, many Italian teenagers have begun to migrate to many European countries, especially in Britain, on the rise of this problem.
Only last year, the number of young people who had to leave Italy because of unemployment had passed 110 thousand.
Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi in the comments of the news of the death of the Italian press, this is the drama of a country that could not provide employment opportunities for young people stated.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can alleviate the IBH
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare to your digestive tract.
But a new study claims the opposite: a rich diet of meat-based proteins and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable health condition affecting 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 people in the UK causes stomach cramps and swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and excessive fatigue.
Although it is recommended that patients usually skip meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington have been advised that the main amino acid trypsin of the protein is the immune cells that enhance a durable intestine helped develop.
The chief researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, said that the immune cells were patrolling the intestines in order not to sneak into the body of microbes stored at dinner.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are compensating with cells that encourage the basis of preserving sensitive tissues without damaging them.
If the balance goes too far into inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
In the experiments, a type of immune cell was found that encouraged the resistance of mice carrying a specific bacteria in their intestines.
And the bacteria need triptofana, one of the building blocks of the protein, to trigger the emergence of cells.
Professor Colonna: ' We have established a connection between the growth of the cell population that promotes endurance with the bacterial species Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the intestinal microbiosis, "he said.
Mice with more tryptophan in their diet had more of these immune cells. '
If the same thing happens in humans, L. reuteri and tryptophan have suggested that a rich diet can develop a more durable, less inflammatory bowel environment.
The post-doctoral researcher, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, was working on some kind of immune cell that improves endurance, while a group of experimental rats have such cells, but are of the same type and are held in a different place He discovered that the group didn't have it.
He suspected that the difference was related to mice with intestinal microbiotics, in other words, bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
Rats had DNA sequels in their intestines, and mice with immune cells had six types of bacteria, but the mice that were missing were found lacking.
In a sterile environment, it was given L. reuteri to rats who were missing a bowel microbiome and did not develop such an immune cell, and the immune cells emerged.
To understand how bacteria affected the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred them to immature immune cells from rats in small quantities, which were not bacteria-free.
The immune cells have become cells that promote endurance.
The active ingredient was revealed to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as indol-3-lactic acid, when it was used for liquid treatment.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the nutrients of mice, the number of cells increased by 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have cells that promote the same strength as mice, and that most of us have a host of L. Reuteri in the gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known that the tryptophan byproducts from L. Reuteri are developed in humans as well as rats, but abnormalities in genes related to tryptopone have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
He said: "The development of these cells is something we probably want to encourage, because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
In cases where L. reuteri is potentially present, high level tryptophan is spreading this population. "
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United has signed a ' genius ' with Nemanja Matic
Midfielder Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic after his first match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million transfer from Chelsea started with a 2-to-1 win in Dublin ahead of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday at United's last pre-season match, and Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira are in the mood for a fast forward attack In the holding position.

"I'd be happier if they'd get four out of 4, but they made a big effort for me."
Last year 197 people were sent to hospital

White House show taxpayers cost thousands
According to the military records described in Hiss, the White House decided to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an organization that featured American production last month, costing the taxpayers up to $24,000.
When the president boarded, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3d, also known as Marine One, was the center of attention in the Organization introducing American building programmes on July 17th in the White House.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officers toustthe products produced in all 50 provinces.
A helicopter in Connecticut, a yacht from Main, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi were exhibited next door.
According to the records of Marine helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter; The White House warfare agency demanded only 36 hours before landing on the southern lawn for a helicopter "unusual" organization (called Frago) with an individual order of the helicopter's presence.
The commander of HMX-1 sent an e-mail to the Supreme Naval Aviation Commander, the day before the event, "I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an unusually high-visibility organization."
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the southern lawn on the morning of July 17th, around 7:00 p.m. for the organization at 3, and that the lawn would remain until the evening was cleared from 6 to 9 p.m.
Note, if the exit from the White House was delayed, it was adding that a second flight crew would be required for the return flight due to the duty hour limitations.
While the unit security personnel were standing in the air transport, the original flight crew was in the chopper during the organization.
It is unclear whether a second flight crew is ultimately necessary from the records provided to the Hiss.
The Hatch law forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.
The records show that HMX-1 is investigating whether the organization violates this requirement.
"A question we have asked is whether it violates the Hatch code and is reported not to us," the commander wrote.
"It seems that you were locked up," he replied, deputy Commander.
The "Made in America" organization is designated as an official organization by the White House and is not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even formal organizations have political implications.
At the time, the president addressed the ongoing health care reform efforts in the Senate and praised efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using air vehicles known as Marine one or air Force one for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new event.
The presidents need to use them to travel.
But it's unusual for them to be formally requested to be used only for the opportunity to take a photo.
Trump pointed out that in February, the presidential plane was in Melbourne Florida when the first campaign rally progressed backstage, and the Twitter account's predecessor was full of messages about the use of the presidential plane.
White House press spokesman Lindsay Walters said: "The White House is thrilled with the ' Made in America ' exhibition, which is made by American workers from all the 50 states with American materials."
The HMX-1 crew is often doing training flights in the Washington area and is doing a drill to leave the US president on the South Lawn with a point-and-shoot at the White House.
At the beginning of July, Trump made a 58 drill landing at the HMX-1 White House when he was in Germany for the G-20 summit.
a competent; The flight for the Made in America organization said the air crew is counting on the need for training in that month.
Unit helicopters flew for an additional 11 hours that day for "support tasks unrelated to the Presidency".
The White House said the taxpayers didn't charge for any other number in the organization.
A spokesman from Sikorksky said the company did not participate in the adjustment of the helicopter being exhibited on the southern lawn.
HMX-1 does not hold budget registrations for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact expense imposed by the organization.
But according to the hourly rates of the DoD's 2017 fiscal year, the DoD's VH-3d coverage rate is $24,340 per flight time.
The Unit records record the flight time of the aircraft from the epicenter in Marine Corps Air facility Quantico Virginia to both sides in 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual operating expense of the helicopter is far below this rate.
"It is very misleading for taxpayers to take an expense based on estimates of expense coverage," Walters said.
"These estimates cover the cost of the wreck, which includes personnel, maintenance and annual expenses."
According to a RAND survey in 2015, the DoD's expense coverage rates do not include personnel expenses, but contain fuel, maintenance and contract expenses.
At that time, the White House's former press spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for this organization.
"The idea here is to exhibit things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contributions to our national security, and I think hundreds of people are bound to do it, even if there aren't thousands.
And I think we're all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans, like most Americans, work tirelessly to do.
So, of course, it is appropriate to bring it forward. "
It's not clear that Trump was interacting with the helicopter while he was touring the Southern Lawn for the organization, but he stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump was joking about the media and the company's products in its own fleet and called on the Sikorsky representatives.
The president said, "I know Sikorsky very well," "I have three of them."

Did PSG warn Barcelona 3 years ago about Neymar's departure?
La Liga side may have regretted their interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up the pursuit of Neymar after presenting the offer that raises the 189 million free item, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record three years ago?

So, was the football world warned about this landscape three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City Blaise expressed interest in Matuidi's signing in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi made a harsh warning to all clubs who wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
Al-Khelaifi said, "I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be against them, we will contact their players."
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they will suffer the consequences. "
Spanish club Barcelona at the beginning of this summer, PSG midfielder Marco Verratti seems to have crossed this line by expressing his interest.
The PSG has made it clear that the Italian national will not be allowed to leave in any condition, and Barcelona feels the reflections of this interest by losing Neymar's greatest values.
