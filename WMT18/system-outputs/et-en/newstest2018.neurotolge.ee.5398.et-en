Four Kemerovo group members were held in Estonia and Spain
According to the Postimehe, the police detained the name of the so-called Kemerovo group leader in Estonia, the so-called Kemerovo group, which is known as Slava Kemerovski, who is known as the criminal world.
Gulevitš was arrested in Spain under the authority of the court.
Yesterday the Court also held three suspected suspects in Estonia.
According to the suspicion, it is the so-called Kemerovo crime community aged 27-57, who mainly commit drug crimes.
In Spain, the alleged leader of the criminal community was detained in the province of Mali in the province of Mali.
In Estonia, the suspect was detained by three men, one of whom has been collected according to the data collected according to the data collected and the two are members of the criminal community.
The data gathered suggest that there were clearly distributed roles and roles in the criminal organisation.
The aim of the criminal community was to commit drug offences and thereby to generate criminal proceeds ," commented on the criminal case leader, the State Attorney General, Vaffickle Verte.
"we do not exclude that there is an increasing circle of suspicion in this criminal case," added to the public prosecutor.
These are people who have already been in the interest of law enforcement services and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed the importance of cooperation with Spanish colleagues throughout the investigation throughout the investigation.
"international cooperation has become common to us, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," commented upon the Attorney Verte.
The Chief Criminal Police Department, Ago Leis, said that the detention facility was preceded by an advance of nearly one and a half years.
"in the first half of the week, the long-term work was realised, and we had doubts about the crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that the officials of the central criminal police were assisted in detention in Spain.
For years we have a good contact and understanding of each other with the Spanish police and the civilian Guard.
These detentions are consistent messages for criminals, so that we can get them on the other end of Europe, "said Leis.
The information gathered so far shows unambiguously that the people who have received a suspect may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the public prosecutor's office requested their arrest and that it was approved by the court.
The man arrested in Spain is waiting for him to surround Estonia.
In the context of this criminal case, property, vehicles and cash are seized to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial procedure is conducted by the Office of the Office for Organised Crime and headed by the public prosecutor's office.
The City Court of Tallinn condemned Slava's Gulevitch in extortion in 2005 and punished him with five years of imprisonment.
In the centre of the last decade, Gulevitšit was regarded as a second man in the notorious world of Estonia.
Gulevitch of Kemerovost rose from the beginning of 1990 when he began to address blackmail in Tallinn.
It is unlikely that he paid taxi drivers and prostitutes at different hotels and demanded a monthly roof fee from the businessmen.
International joint operations, the seizures of criminal proceeds and the judgments in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest judgments, the eight indictees of the so-called Dikayev crime scene, from whom the proceeds of the criminal proceeds of EUR 80 000, or nine persons, were confiscated in the case of Igor Aleynikov, in 2006, created by a criminal community aimed at the illicit trade in illegal trade and trafficking in human trafficking in East Viruna and South Estonia.
There is an estimated amount of around EUR 71 500 in the confiscated criminal income.
In these cases, it is a success that police officers will exchange information and prosecutors on a daily basis with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, carry out operations in any country of the European Union.
The Civil Liberties Committee warns Missouri to travel
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has cautioned the black people travelling to Missouri from the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The Group " s statement states: 'the Missouri Road Map, valid until 28 August 2017, calls on all African-American passengers, visitors and missoulorans to be particularly attentive and extremely careful when travelling across the state, taking into account the whole series of dubious racial events that have recently taken place over the state, and here as well.'
According to the NAACP, the group urged the group to issue a travel warning for the recent Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to fight cases concerning discrimination, but also the fact that there is a lack of discrimination on the part of the state law enforcement targets.
"people's citizens' rights are being violated.
They are torn from the edge of their skin due to their color, beaten or killed, "said NAACP Missouri, President Rod Chapel, newspaper The Kansas City Star.
"we've never gotten so tight before."
This is the first warning issued by the organisation for the US State.
The Group referred to events such as racist insults in the head of the black students in Missouri University and the death of the 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died of the beginning of this year in the dubious circumstances after he was run out of gas in the state and Missouri police took him into custody without being accused of a crime.
In addition, a note refers to the report drawn up recently by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri, which shows that the car drivers of the black car drivers are more likely to be stopped by 75%in the state than the white ones.
"the mark is intended for people to be aware, and to warn their families, friends and employees for what happened in Missouri," said Chapel.
"people need to be ready, so this means getting bail money, or informing the relatives of the fact that they cross the state."
According to the latest information from the FBI on the latest data from the FBI, in Missouri in 2015, 100 hate crimes were documented in the country by the number of similar infringements inthe country's section 16.
Travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult to sue the company for a search for a place of residence or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued a series of travel comments for Texas and Arizona after these states adopted immigration laws that obliged local authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration, because the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, stakeholders have started to use this measure as a reaction to certain US laws and trends.

While on the last round, the competitors tried to print the four-fold Olympic winner, found a 34 year old Farah infinity force and won the deadline of 26.49,51.
Farah never meant for a long time, with her husband, Tania and the children after the finiche.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
"being on the track with them was amazing," said "Farah to journalists."
Farah's heading for the fifth title shot in London in a row of 5000 and 10,000 feet of golden dull.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O 'Connor is digested in Daam's gold. Gustav Klimti masterpieces, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait of the Adele Bloch-Bauer portrait, "the birth of one art of art fardeeper into the 19th century of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna.
But more thoroughly in history.
The carnivorable illumination of the carnivorable illegation, the more narrower subject would have allowed the exorbitant portrait of an extraordinary story to escape more.
Now, between the two books, there are two books: the story of Gustav Klimti and his painting "Daam kullas" depicted the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer and a much more extensive and comprehensive history book of esteemed family members and the German occupation with its repercussions in Austria.
The first third of the book takes place in the midst of Vienna's cultural life and who itself in the Austrian capital can only imagine how much more than a hundred years ago, in the vicinity of the Ringstrasse or how, in the cafe of Centrali, all the heads were turned when they came in.
The concentration of cultural characters in one of the rich cities in Europe is high and in a book familiar with a familiar name, it felt like the gramme culture.
At the same time, the fact that Sigmund Freud was operating in a town where there was no cure for syphilis and was the highest suicides in Europe, as is the case for the development of the story.
However, in the 20th century, the color of the cultural life of Vienna is added to the cultural life of the 20th century.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna was exploded, changing the largest Jewish communities in Western Europe.
For centuries, every ten Vienna inhabitants had a Jew.
Adele's parents were newcomers in Vienna, but by the time that Adele married twice the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and the Com posed for his famous paintings, his father's bank had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet all this glamorous life that she was famous didn't.
When we look at Daam's golden age, it is hard to believe that life upon the end of the life would infect this great lady from socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband's portrait from the Canyon, the last time was the hottest painter in Vienna.
The client's order paid 4,000 at the time, a quarter of a good location in the land market.
The fact that, in the case of a few portrait, the man was suspected of having a mastermind affair with a model, the sugar magnabe did not appear to be intimidated.
As far as Adeleas is concerned, the only fact remains that the relationship between the model and the artist created in the course of work continued for the rest of their lives.
Anne-Marie O 'Connor - Daam gold.
Gustav Klimti masterpieces, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait of the Adele Bloch-Bauer portrait, Varrak 2016, an English language translated Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before the start of the work with Adelega, the Klimt had been hit by Ravenna San Vitale, and the detectives think it was the brilliant mosages of the Empress Theodore gave the artistthe idea of making a golden portrait of Adelest in the color of the painted mosaigina.
In 1908 and around the same time (1907-1908), "The Great War" was born in 1909 and around the same period (1907-1908).
Art historians didn't miss the resemblance of the two women.
What about the story Hitler?
"I think that I owe him my friend's Klimti to make his handiwork available to the public," he wrote to Adele Bloch-Bauer a couple of years after the artist's departure ("Klimt died in February 1918) " to the Belvedere Museum of Museum and requested that their family members would go to the museum.
Six years before he died, the client had a portrait of Adelest.
Also in his will, Adele left in February 1925, he called for his wife to leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimti landscape painting for the Austrian Galerios.
His jewelry gave his niece to Maria and Lucy.
In a year after Klimt had completed the "Austrian Mona Lisa," it had been trying to get to the Academy of Caus of Vienna for 17 years Adolf Hitler, but fell through the line of the drawing.
However, sometimes Hitler's later anti-Semitism is due to the fact that the Jewish professors did not take him to the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the Austrian Galerii task, cited in Maria's will, was significantly changeable in 1939 - it was important to find the work of the Nazis of Vienna from the rich arts of the Jewishcommunity.
In Hitler's personal art of art, some of the work they had had in Adele home, but not the customers of the Canyon.
Eighty years after the Nazis of the Nazis, the war began a ten-year trial between the Austrian Government and the municipality of Bloch-Bauers.
In this case, it would only be noted that, if the "kiss" is seen in Vienna in Belvedere, Adele Bloch-Bauer can be seen as "the Daam gold" to visit the New York Neue Galerim.
And before the Vienna race, you can read the aforementioned book.
Even if you're not going to see the Klimti's work, because at least my emotions turn up more of a Nazi and Jewish thing than the $135 million sold and the model for Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not as much as a portrait, rather than a sexual destiny, and a very touching story.
It was noted that events were brought up by the Bauer family tree in the beginning of the book.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record.
The gold in the life of gold was also very close to the personal record of the 200 m of seliliswimming swimming in the 200 m of the seine swimming pool, in a swimming pool of 2.16,62.

The young hope is still in the Canadian adult championship of 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in free space, 200 m and 400 m for complete construction.
During the week in Toronto, the Canadian Football Championship, and Gold made successful takeoffs there.
He won 200 m free of gold in a silver medal with a time of 2.03,22.
This was the last time that we were swimming by the distance, last year in 2008.
It is the most populous city of Estonia.
As a leader in Canada, another bronze medal won the 100 m free of a great personal record and a new season of 56.66 of the new Estonian season.
For example, the elder of the year, Kertu Ly Alnek, has gone through this distance by only one century faster.
At the same time, he reached 100 m in the middle of a drive-by in the opening of the driveway with a letter of 1.03,69.
For a half long distance, he only achieved the seventh seat when the swim in the finals of 2.17,31.
Gold is currently leading the season of the Estonian season in four different distant lands.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpening their teeth.
The time of the holiday is in hand - it also means the relaxation of the President of the United States to the President of the United States Donald Trump.
Since Trump has, however, been one of the most recent holiday days, the critics already sharpened their teeth.
According to the US Today and CNN, a 17-day vacation is scheduled to spend a 17-day vacation in a house of a golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the President's vacation started yesterday, Trump has spoken on the subject of the leave since the week.
They're throwing Trump out of the way too often.
In fact, the President has the practice of spending the weekend in the villa in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the president of the cleanest in his 196 business days.
For example, George W. Bush reached its age of 67 days, with Barack Obama half as Trump, but for 21 days.
But the Trump has a hard dream.
A few days later, Trump said, "60 minutes," he said, "No more time for her employee to stay as long as she needs to be done."
He also praised Barack Obama's leave three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time: 'while Obama is on vacation, plays golf, go to parties and jazz concerts, the ISIS is chopping the heads off'.
According to the White House officials, a 17-day golf club visit isn't exactly a relaxation.
It is commonly referred to as a job rest for which Trumpil may not have time for time for time or for other senses.
In addition, there had to be a second reason for duty leave.
In fact, the White House is changing the air conditioning system in the west wing, so the entire staff had to leave.
In the Western wing, the Oval Office and the other offices of the President are also located.
"I do not believe that any of you want to be in the west wing of August if there is 38 degrees and there is no air conditioner," said the White House phone call for Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue working during the holiday.
Where President Trump is next 17 days, you can see the video.
Blockade of critics from Facebook not to apply to the State if you do not tolerate voters' criticisms
Our country's father knew a few things about unfavourable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers did not long enough to start fighting for everything from internal politics to the political principles.
The criticism, of course, irritated her.
But he didn't force his critics to silence.
In 1783, Washington said that "freedom of speech may be taken from us, and we can lead to the slaughter of animals, in a way of sheep, in the way of sheep."
This brings me to the governor of Maryland Larry Hogan, who's working hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan has been blocked and erased by the postal services of at least 450 people who have expressed their views on the official Facebook page.
The European Union for Freedom of Civil Liberties (ACLU) was therefore sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
The governor's officials were inhabited by the proceedings and online comments were about the reactions of the 'Who cares?' ."
"it's just Facebook," you said a lot.
But it does matter.
And it matters very much when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It's amazingly popular with the governor of the Republican governor in a democratic state.
His acceptance percentage is the second most right-hand side of the state's 50 governors.
Hogan is not an unthinkable pigeon.
He has been leading the state on a solid hand and remains firmly anchored to its principles.
In addition, he has used his constituents with his constituents on Facebook, for example, after the first time of the chemotherapy.
Thus, the governor " s paper is a public forum with official marking, managed by the blocking of people from taxpayers' dollars to the blockade of people visited by taxpayers, which is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
The Hogan spokesperson, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's behavior in the interview on The Washington Post, claiming that there was nothing but modeling.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of the web trolls, spawning maids or hate people.
The Post was talking to a bunch of real people Hogan intercepted.
And that's exactly what they're about to be the real people who communicate with their chosen leaders. Teacher, owner of the business and pastor, not Internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respected, thoughtful, and not in any way.
Pastor quoted a Bible in his post, oppressing Hogan's Catholicism.
A lawyer from the Maryland Bowie called Lakshm Horma Ramani didn't encourage anger, but for real hate crimes.
"I am pleased to be disappointed that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in The Post's comments on the news story.
"I also don't like the idea of how many people comment on the same subject as a collective effort, instead of recognising that it is a great deal of concern with citizens."
What the governor's department called "targeted spam" would probably call "public support."
The Facebook era enables messages to be easily fit by simply by blocking a critic or by deleting a negative comment.
This is much cleaner than the old days when the same thing had to be sent out of staff, to collect and burn them or arrest the protestors and to silence them.
But that's what's happening right now, just in digital.
Hogan is not the first public official criticised for the toothpaste of Facebook and other social media.
President Trumpi has complained to the courts on Twitter by Twitter, who is blocked from his Twitter bed.
One of the first legal decisions on the matter was that on that issue last week in Virginia.
President James C. Cacheris, President of the United States District, decided in Alexandria that the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudouni County Council was responsible for the first correction of the Constitution when he was blocked by the electorate on his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, ACLU paid tribute to Facebook and Twitter by Governor Matt Bewinit (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, affordable postal costs had similar effects on the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers and the anonymous scriptors in the newspapers gave up his leadership.
And even then Washington had to put an anonymous troll in the chest.
People wrote letters to the newspapers under such pseudonyms like Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington decisions the ground.
According to the historical documents collected in the framework of a project for the collection of web-based George Washington, his office was buried under the office of petitions which criticized his views on relations between friends, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't force them to remain silent.
Freedom, special opinions and discussions are the foundations of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.

The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known among the people as Jokowi, promised in its 2014 election campaign to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter won the Jakarta presidential Palace in 29 constituencies, including Paniai.
But there's very little change in Papua and the locals feel deceived.
"our hearts are broken, because in 2014 we voted in favour of Jokow in anticipation that he meets our hopes for the restoration of justice," he said.
In fact, the Paniai was barely two months after he took office in the middle of October.
On 7 December 2014, 11 children sank in the Enotenan to Christmas, when two Indonesian soldiers showed up on a motorcycle.
The clueless children told them that they should turn the front lights on.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was insulted to their vocabulary tone and then returned later with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the drunken soldiers chased children and beat them with their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot in the children.
One child, a 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, beat so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby Electoral Commission building was set on fire and the next day, things were on fire.
About 1,000 young paapes, women and children gathered for justice for the local police station and the football field ahead of the military control center.
They carried out the ceremonial hunting buses and provided the pause of the honey of Paapua honey as a tribe waita-dance, in which the flock was drunk and a bird song was buried.
Some protestors started throwing stones at the police and military.
There was an order for soldiers to be sent to soldiers through an infirmary sequestration. "if the crowd shows more than three times the resistance, shoot them," said according to the official document, which has been the subject of a magazine, but what has not been issued to local media publications.
The oldest city in the city of Enarotenn in the town of Kego Koto (56) felt threatened and called for peace, asking the crowd to go home.
No one would like to listen.
"in the circle, I was suddenly shot in a left wrist," he said to the press at his private paints on the porch of the tree house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from the troops of the assembled soldiers.
"there was a lot of money, a lot of shots from the League," she adds.
The local man Alfius Youw has seen his cousin hit him three times before he shot him.
"I would run to her and studied her body, to make sure that this was her," said the word for the magazine in Yohanes, who uses only one name as many trustees.
"I see she's dead..." I kissed her. "
Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende of Papua police told reporters that his subjects only returned their department to safety because it was attacked.
"we need to defend ourselves" if we are threatened to kill, "in 2015, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo.
"it's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many injured.
The news about the killings arrived at Jakara only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokow held a passionate speech in Jayapuras, where he expressed his sympathy with the victims' families and promised to deal with the mistreatment in Papua.
"I want to solve this case now" that it will never happen again in the future, "he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security, Wiranto, said that it would establish an extra-judicial mechanism to resolve the crimes against human rights.
But the apologies almost immediately followed.
"most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place during the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must abide by certain processes, "he said.
Speaking in Jakarta, speaking on 5 June, Wiranto said he had no intention of creating a mechanism to deal with complaints from Paapuas.
Instead, he said, "All will be settled by the law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations on human rights crimes against the death of more than 1 000 people in Timor-Leste in the course of a referendum in Timor in 1999, said that11 human rights violations had already been resolved in Papua, including what happened in Paniai.
The families of the Paniai victims took such claims against a birth of a birth.
"I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still dreadful years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the Army will arrest me, I fear I will be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the Paniai people are afraid of this incident.
He said he got beat up by the Army after he had helped bury four victims.
"after the cemetery was buried, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the village of Indonesian police shot the village of Paniai in the neighbourhood of Deiyais.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when it went to war between the villagers and the construction company manager who refused to transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
This guy, 24-year-old cure Douw, who drowned the fish in a nearby river, died on the road to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in the construction site before the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing away the villagers with cops on the rocks that they were picking up with a warning shot.
But according to the local people, the mobile brigade started shooting at the people of the people of Indonesia, killing one person.
"we were in a big panic, we fear vengeance," he said the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital, and saw the insanity of the injured.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The House of Deiyai has called for the prosecution of police officers and the withdrawal of the police mobile bridge from the region.
Paniai has always been a troubled place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the honey, moni, dani and damali tribes in the hallowed central mountainland of Paapua.
Many of them have joined the Free Pap Movement (VPL) with the rebels' army, which, according to himself, protects the rights of the passions, arranging a random series of attacks and kidnappings of the kidnappers among the Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL leaders come from Paniaist, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the military, on the pretext of defending the sovereignty of the State, has arrested Paniai in the last few years, and had arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them never come out again.
Among the people of Papua known as Panian as "tragic forgotten positions."
Poverty feeds on discontent.
The vibrant rice that is sold in Enarotalis is too expensive for local purchasing.
The bread is equally unavailable.
People grow their whole food themselves mainly from bataat, but also a little bit of fruit and flat vegetables.
Farming is women's work, each of whom is capable of caring for four or five baselines.
They usually keep most of the harvest to the family, the rest on the local market.
Only 10 000 Indonesian square (75 cents) will pay 10 000 bataat.
Over time, there has been an increase in economic inequalities between the bladder stock and the new migrants, which have come to the worst since the opening of the new routes of Nabire Airport.
These few jobs that exist are better educated and more prosperous migrants.
They often lack capital or the necessary skills for a competitive business.
"young people are not interested in staying around, because there are no jobs or money," says the president of the Paniai Tribal Council, John Gobai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, there are severe restrictions on the external media.
At the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were sent out of Papua as' they did not follow the relevant practices', even though they had been givena rare film authorisation.
According to Mr Psounm Kine, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises made by Jokow have not been carried out in order to remove the restrictions imposed on the promotion of transparency and development.
In the case of journalists trying to make journalists who are trying to make a visa and a black list, "he said," he said in a statement.
The absence of eye drilling means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Paapua.
In March, six Pacific states were driven by Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands to explore "various large-scale crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Paniai.
The same countries have supported historically also VPL.
Mr Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dumped the group's accusations, to put Jakarta in Jakarta: "in Indonesia,democratic regimes and freedom of the press were still in force so that evidence of cases of human rights abuses would be difficult to bury."
Local people want more foreign governments to pay attention.
When the formal Dutch delegation of the Dutch National Human Rights Envoy visited Jayapurat in Jayapurat on 4 May on 4 May, the local people stopped at the meeting, but the source that wished to remain anonymous, said, "We want freedom."
New presidential elections in Indonesia will take place in 2019, but they do not believe that they will vote in favour of Jokow again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but the people surrounding him are connected to the Paniai shooting," says the Chairman of the Countess Council Hobai.
He wants to be given to Jokowile that, in addition to the fact that the people of Paniai are constantly living under the threat of a predator army, they suffer from the poor education and health services in misery.
According to Gobai, the Paniai people, as well as other paiders, must have the voice of their voice in Jokowile, which he has to pay.
"they don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite the theft and intimidation of Paniai, the families of the Paniai have managed to deal with the last symbolic controversy, they buried the body of one of the victims' bodies to the land of the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice can never be made to his feet, they won't at least let the insurgents forget their crimes.
"one of our family members was killed," said Yacobus in his head.
"what else can we do?"
The fire of the Mooney Tower of Dubai had already taken the second time.
The fire went through one of the highest houses in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of people to get away from this altitude of 337 metres and from the 79th floor of the building.
This is another fire that has devastated a superstructure that happens to be called Torch.
The building was evacuated, none of the damage reported and there were no direct signs of fire.
"we slept and woke up the fire alarm and the yelling of people.
We ran down from the stairs and we took about 10 minutes to get to the 50th floor, "said to Reuters a resident who called himself George.
According to civil protection officers in Dubai, the firefighters were extinguished at a local time of approximately 4 a.m. (00.00 GMT) and cooling the building.
The government said they work for the victims of shelter.
This incident may once again raise concerns about the safety of materials used in the world's external surface area.
The investigation conducted by the Torch Bureau in the wake of the 2015 fire was found that the most damage suffered by the ornamental panels and isolation of the fasambassador " s external surface.
The British police have said that they believe that the Tower of London, the Tower of the City of London, has been able to contribute to the fire within the time of the fire in June, which killed approximately 80 people.

There's a lot of celebrities leaking into the new Galaxy Note 8.
There is a need for even more commercial users, and the S Pen allows even greater functionalities.
There should be two cameras on the phone, one of which is a lainurk and a second lens with a narrower field.
Now, there is no one else to be able to do so, but in any case, it is the first test of Samsung, which is certainly comparable with the iPhone 8 in terms of quality.
We'll wait until after the 23rd to August.

For Sony's new model, it is speculated that the screen is at least six.
What the reality brings, we can see the very head, because traditionally Sony has released its autumn flag ship with the flagship of the IFA, which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September.

Following the closure of the EPA following the decision to postpone the summer regulation
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (Environmental Environmental Protection Agency) annulled a decision to delay the introduction of a regulation imposing a regulation obliginga state to restrict the exhaust gases that cause the skies, one day after the 15 States complained to the Agency because of its progress.
The EPA announced its decision to proceed on the late Wednesday, by saying that this demonstrates the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the states.
"we believe we need to have a dialogue with our states with our partners and hear them," said Mr Scott Pruitt's statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the EPA to postpone ozone concentrations in the course of which the pollution of the different parts of the country was measured in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to meet the highest standard of air quality.
The 15 main democratic states, together with the Columbia Circle, have brought an action on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
The government of President Donald Trumpi has tried to withdraw a number of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama. According to the trump, it is part of a broader agenda for the growth market.
However, these efforts have given rise to counter-reactions among the Democratic and Natural Protection groups, who are concerned about the impact of increased contaminants on human health.
On the EPA website it is stated that ozone containing ozone can reduce the ability of lungs to work and increase the risk of respiratory symptoms such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
In German pigs and cattle there can be a party because the strong hints threaten the prey of the second-largest wheat producer in the European Union, writes Bloomberg.
This can be done in such a way that for weeks of harvesting before harvest, it may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry would only serve as bait for the animal.
"the quality of the content is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015," said Agravis Raiffeisen analyst Bernhard Chilla.
It can go up to 40 per cent of German wheat for animal feed, which is double compared to the usual, forecast in Agravis.
The German farmers, as well as those of their European colleagues, have faced this year in all forms of weather.
The winter was too dry.
Then the cold spring came, which was replaced by a heat wave in June.
In July, Germany had sails, which has continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned to northern Germany, where the rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five per cent of wheat have been harvested.
Most of the area has not yet begun to harvest, announced a local harvest purchaser Ceravis.
"the Hand is a very difficult period," said Mr Frank Deckert Rendsburg, Senior trader of Ceravis.
Consistent with all, the smart interior design of the Finns.
The beautiful nature plays its part in the messives' interclubs because of the great windows of the Saimaa fishermen reach many of the rooms (lives) of the Saimaa.
Every step will have an eye on the ambition of our northern neighbours to bring together both the rough and the perfect (energy-saving) homes.
Admiration and compliance is also worthy of armored wood for the use of construction and finishing materials, furniture and beauty.
There is a series of solutions that can be seen as both a builder and a (home) designer.
It states that there may be very fragility to the black, white and gray margins, if they are complementary to the wood tones and room plants.
The good ideas can be picked up for another week, because the fair is 13 to August.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time discussing the potential confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are supposed to be in a collision course to face the most embracing boxer in the short future for a weighting category of up to 66.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in the ESPN office in a separate rooms in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the invincible World Boxing Board champion, walked the corridor to another to welcome Lomachenkot, the Sulgweighting champ of the World Boxing Organizing.
Following the successful decision of the Garcia with a victory over the former four-time world champion Adrien Broneri on Saturday in Showtime, both fighters belong to the front page of the table.
Garcia reached her right arm and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you luck. "
Lomachenko protects his belts with Miguel Marrid on a Saturday night at nine19 in ESPN.
In the case of a couple of photographs, Lomachenko said the manager of Egis said that there would be a "perfect measure."
"I'm the former sulfur," said Garcia.
"I woke up to the Bronger [ 63.5 kg], but I'm not so big.
I'm a little bit about 63.5 kg.
I want to move downwards.
And he has to move upwards of the light weight [ 61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The Fang has wanted it.
So let's offer them this. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"the Kid's world needs this fight."
On the occasion of the customer, the question was whether it should be standard. This is part of his strategy, according to which it wants to allow Lomachenko to depress at the end of this year to 61.2 kg in class, in order to make a possible meeting with Garcia (37-0.30 knockout), which will also have an interest in combating Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbell, after their lime mark on 23 September.
"the review of this fight could be a meltdown, as the fans have wished for this confrontation," said Garcia, saying later that he was open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"we're the key players.
There's another name that can't get so much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he thinks he's got Lomachenko as "great fighter" and he can go see his Saturday.
Lomachenko was modest for Garcia, saying that he felt that the three division champions from Riverside saw "very slow; I'm sorry, Mikey... you wanted that knockout."
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the intensity of the impact and then to fight.
Both confirmed the tension of the tension between them.
"this is a fight that awaits realisation.
There's no other confrontation, so much attention and suminate.
I'm more than willing to work for it, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is right.
It's gonna be a good fight. "
What sort of world space are they moving to Estonia?
Over 13 000 residence permits issued by the police and border authorities (PPA) have been extended and issued with a record of more than 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit of 6702 foreigners, the number of which was 4928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants are eventually staying permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis will be drawn up in the Ministry of the Interior.
Ten years ago, nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year, and in the last few years, this figure will get close to 2000.
The number of applications for a residence permit rose rapidly in Ukraine during the crisis in Ukraine - 1087 people received a fixed-term residence permit in 2014, a year earlier in 675.
According to the Statistical Office, the number of Ukrainian citizens is the largest in Estonia; in Estonia, 850 Ukrainian citizens came to Estonia more than he left.
"the Ukrainian community has been large in Estonia all the time, and because of the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural to seek employment and learning opportunities in a country in which the community and many also already have a family," the press representative of the Ministry of the Interior, Kristin Rammus.
The number of Ukrainians has become the number of Ukrainian citizens, even though in the ten years the most recent residence permits have been granted.
If the Ukrainians come here predominantly to work, Russian citizens for family migration.
"given the historical Russian community, they are also more likely to have the biggest family ties with the people living in Russia," said the ISP as Helina Maasing.
"if you see where the Russian citizens of Estonia have been able to live on the ground, they are now in the East Virus," and he pointed out that about 40% of them have been married to a citizen of the European Union.
There were 1696 Russian citizens, which are also a record number.
At the same time, the amount of Russians that wished to extend the residence permit was reduced.
"Jump is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit a new residence permit has been requested to take place on a permanent basis," Mr Rammus, the press representative of the Ministry of the Interior, explained that the interest of Russian citizens had remained stable for years against the Estonian residence permit.
The new residence permit for Estonia will have lived here for at least three years to apply for a period of at least three years.
The aim of this is to encourage the unemployed people to stay here.
A long-term resident's residence permit, for example, requires five years.
The renewal of an old residence permit has probably also diminished since the new residence permit.
For example, this residence permit was given to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians will be able to change their work, and the Estonian state is no longer with the point of pointing out whether the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit was popular as a popular call for a further grey passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and niggers (36).
In total, there were 1968 people living in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same amount of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants has already been 1269.
In the next year, Nigeria has become a country which has become one of the most active citizens of Estonia " s residence permit.
In the case of three residence permits issued by the Nigerians in 2007, 200.
The universities of Nigeria are studying here in these universities.
Estonian universities are also popular, for example among the Georgians, the Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely through the learning band.
There is also a rule that the rule is that where there is a community in advance, there is more to others', in addition to Rammus.
During the course of the year, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 South Korea, 40 from Indonesia, and four of Uruguay.
If around 6,000 third-country nationals receive residence permits per year, it is about 0.46% of the entire population.
Even if the citizens of the European Union are to be excluded, migration falls to around the percentage ', commented on the Strait that the figures in fact are small.
In total, 14 822 people were travelling to Estonia, according to the Statistical Office, out of here but 13 792.
This means that immigration exceeded another year's emigration.
Most of the sheer and insurgents are Estonian citizens, but more are among the breakers.
As a result, the migration balance of the citizens of Estonia was in the soil of 2,000 people.
In particular, the Estonians migrate between Finland and Estonia.
"Mages Couture"
In the North East, Maria Tammevalley still has history, the old paintings and the costumes: "I can dream about hours somewhere in a museum, and to admire the elves and cracks.
If you do something about it, you'll study and learn about it every day.
It's a joy of discovery!
A glamorous world of Mages Couture may appear to be a stranger, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much you've got in your life!
I've got a girlfriend who's got a whole sauna full of the shark couture that I created.
Because it's not her fault she doesn't live in Hollywood and you don't go on the red carpet every day, and she wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and wear them!
You can live your life special!
The Moeartist won't admit the gap between the shining events and the gray Army day.
This reasoning put the plan to take a heavyweight in Estonia, between lands, forests and fields, people who often fail to reach them.
For example, Mages was presented as "The Gallery."
In Tallinn, there is often poos in the pot, but there are more emotions in elsewhere - call the bravo, rise up, want to thank you on your hand.
A big part of the audience just showed up, but now they're Mages Couture fans.
If you cross the expectations of the people, they're psyched!
And I like it that I feel like I'm on a summer tour with my fashion.
Well, we've had a red carpet of 50 feet tall, the whole street filled with beautiful dresses, it seemed like they didn't have the end of it!
Maria doesn't admit the fashion sense is that the creation needs to present a supermodel to a supersal supermodel, he'd be happy to bring the normal women to the stage.
Often, I invite my own clients - they've always been happy to come.
This is so exciting, you get a spark on stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my show once, I'm always backstage trying to make a hopeless perfectionist of things the last simple.
My nerves wouldn't allow me to look at the site peacefully.
Maria is the kind of mover of this kind who do not only want to play a representative role, but to be in the hands of everything.
I have my sewing machine at the studio, most of the collection myself.
I like the whole process where you play the details, you'll find out.
I'm never far from my nature and I'm not afraid of work.
The designer thing is not just about style, logistics, organizing, organizing, everyone needs to fit in for a temperamental woman's day.
These hours of work will still be huge.
I can't tell you when my day ends, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I'm so lucky, it's like an unstoppable fortune chain: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful, and yet compliments.
How many times has it been said that there are magic in my dresses - they make themselves feel like a princess.
The colonial gardener saciracks that made Maria's last night famous are Mages Couture's signature to date.
Martin Homicide U18 boys: the gun of the Estonians was turned against us now
I'm sorry about the fairy tale.
The first thing left is that we didn't get our table.
And if there is such a big difference in the table, there is nothing to do ," commented on the Estonian U18 basketball company 61:75 for the UK, our only NBA played basketball, BC Kalev / Cramo Aid coach Martin, the Speaker of Martin.
There were 28 balls from the attack board and so many more attacks.
We weren't prepared for their aggressive protection nor attack, it created.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we could not build a defense.
But in defense, they got to keep their hands on each other, we couldn't get a combination.
It hit a team on his legs.
His homework was better done.
According to the Speaker, Estonia would have to make more tactical mistakes in order to take off the attack on the eos.
With the last quarter of the quarter, we had zero error, but the opponent already got a quick basket.
It was our weapon that was our weapon, and now all of us turned against us.
Today we had no force against their aggressiveness.
The Speaker of the Series remained in Kalevis with his neglect, with Matthias Tass alone.
In general, there were good words for the whole team to say, to date, there was a single set of fives.
It's a pity we've already met this aggressive response before.
Tass has always been confident, and he has been playing it out, but it seemed he was tired - he has carried quite a load.
But he did a pretty good move I've ever seen in the trenches, "I've got a tutor.
Horrible numbers: at the newer's basketball team, the ER threw less than 10 points in three quarters...
In the age of U18, only the young men's EMs B-Division basketball tournament in Tallinn has been launched in Tallinn, the girls started in Dublin yesterday.
And the Estonian game with Poola, unfortunately, was the subject of an anti-record sector.
Estonia lost 25:65 but still after the third quarter, it was 9:49 or only over the last ten minutes, the opponent took the foot from the accelerator and that period remained at 16:16.
In the first and second quarter of the quarter, Estonia threw a fourth, third point...
However, in the first two minutes, the Estonians caught two in the first two minutes in two minutes, leaving 25 in the game, then one in three, and then another 21 to pass...
In almost half an hour, 47 were captured by one.
In addition, 2 of the four points were released.
The loss of life was a reasonable number of time, 12.
At the end of the game there was 33 and 13% of the Polish whiskey (68 / 9).
Estonia has started with two casualties, and on the day of the day, it had to be recognised as Portuguese 83:56 on the right.
NATO vessels have come to the Tallinn stock to be complementary to supplies
Today, NATO has arrived at the 1st permanent meeting of NATO for the weekend in Tallinn to a scheduled port visit to complete the stock of vessels and to prepare for predominant habits.
In the case of fuel, the vessels shall prepare for the sea and give the crew the opportunity to take a few days of rest.
After the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonia's waters to conduct a series of exercises and to be prepared for future historical explosive search operations.
The participation of the Eestchildren in the NATO unit and the co-operating training provided by them in local waters looks well on our integration with the Allied forces', said Commander of the Operations and Planning Department, Commander of the Marine Fleet, Commander Arto Reinmaa.
With effect from 29 June, NATO is headed by a Marine Commander Gvido Laudups, Latvia Marine of Latvia, who took over the tasks of a group leader in Riga, from the Estonian naval officer to Commander Johan-Elias Selja.
The group " s flag vessel has been assigned to the LVNS Virsaitis, the Latvian Marine Support vessel, which also acts as a group leader.
In this half of the year, the International Unit of the International Unit is also part of the Estonian Naval Straits.
As one of the four ships under the aegis of NATO, NATO " s 1 Regional Advisory Group on the primary & quot; core & quot; of the & quot; High Level Group & quot; is an area of preparedness which, within five days, can be sent to different parts of the world.
4. - On 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Monastery of Pirita will be restored by a place to be abandoned 13 years ago in the Birgitta Festival of the Maestro Er of the Maestro Eri.
In Birgitta Birgitta Festival, Tallinna is a beautiful, powerful and unprecedented art leader Risto Joseph (36).
Risto Joost: to the Millions of the opera "Traviata" and "Tosca," ballethize by a fascinating "Bolerost" ("Bolerost"), which is not missing from the scheme, which is the last name of Joseph Haydn's mammal Orthodox ("years") by the same international team, which, in 2015, was brought to Haydn's stage as "Loomine" in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is more than just concerts and theatrical answers.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
This is a festival, a compression of which will take over from power and never let go real again.
Because the experience that the listener gets in this vast and mysterious environment makes the human souls sound, and relates to human perception in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, for the first year, you are the art leader of Birgitta Festival.
Didn't the Maestro Er's shoes feel a little larger?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klass, it's been a lot of help.
He made me through my student career as well, and he also supported my division career early.
Maybe it's just because it's easier for me to continue his work.
In the various Klas, the Birgitta Festival team has taken so many goodness and, of course, it's all over me.
It was great to join the team, who knows how things are.
Just the great heart of Er Klas gave me the power to go forward with Birgitta Festival in Tallinn.
And here I am and I can handle it!
What could possibly excite the festival on the festival, what are you proposing?
We have the Armenians from England, Latvia, Lithuania, and by surprise, the first ballet, written to the story of Mrs Lindgren's story, is to be presented.
It's "Karlsson flies."
And one of the notorious nuances at that is that the author of this ballet is the name of the Latvian composer, Juris Karlsons, who made her wish to write it.
Apparently, he's had a Karlsson character in his soul since he was a kid.
Risto, how are you doing all this stuff?
Thanks to my husband, I'm sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and that's what I'm thankful for.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions don't depend on much of the other people, so that I'm about to go back to every new day.
And this aware of the tone, the lack of a positive attitude and, in fact, smiley myself in the morning in the morning, greatly raised my lucky number.
Especially now this week, when there are the most important samples, I've been practicing it in particular, and it's working.
Smiling himself is the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a word.
I think people don't know the shit about their bodies, what the universe is offering to them, but, uh, it's the same thing that makes it easy.
Right now, it's just a big moment.
Do you have a ritual before the division of the dimer's remote?
It is, the clothes need to be replaced by more comfortable ones.
This is just a moment for yourself.
But, generally, yes, I don't have a chance to rest until I have a big show or a little nap.
In fact, I even like to actively communicate with people, even before the dirigible remote.
But come into Birgitta Festival, here's what you can discover, not particularly big opera and ballet friend!
Look at the desperate video with Risto Joseph!
New results of the tests on the age of age evaluation of applicants for Swedish asylum applicants were published.
In Sweden, a test was carried out in the case of asylum seekers, which assessed their age as a medically advanced approach. The latest results of the test show that more than 80% of the institutions were assessed as older than 18 but not all of them believe in the precision of the results.
The Swedish Institute of Civil Matters (Rättsmedicinalverket) began the tests for the beginning of this year.
The tests were designed to make the age more accurate when applying for asylum after the Swedish Migrationsverket was criticised for having failed to correctly quantify the age of a number ofalleged juvenile refugees.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent the 680 cases to the trial and the case of the judicial medicine has issued a total of 2481 test results between the mid-March of March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) was estimated to be 18 years old or older, and in another 25 cases, the medical institute assessed that the test "may be 18 years old or older."
In the field of 432, it came to the conclusion that human is "probably younger than 18."
Tests shall be used only if the age of the person is under the question of question.
According to the report by Johan Göransson, the results were consistent with those of the months preceding months.
"we do not see the big differences compared to the statistics of the last few months, the numbers are quite consistent," said "The Local.
The fact that a large number of cases were assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been lying about their age.
The Institute issued the results of the 581 test results in May and said, in 442 cases, "there are indications that the person under investigation is 18 years old or older."
However, if the Svenska Dagbladet investigated the result of these 581 test results, it was found that in 243 cases, the person claimed that it could be 18.
This medical age assessment method, whereby X-ray images of wisdom teeth and knee joint MRI, after which they are allowed to be analysed in dentists and radiology, have been criticised in some circles.
One scepticist is Claude Marcus, author of the Karolinska Institute, whose tasks include an assessment of human biological maturity to determine whether or not they passed through puberty sooner or later.
"I have had a reason to think about it, and I do not think that the method of measurement that is currently being used should be used.
The determination of biological age in such a way is highly uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't make a face that we can, "he said to the newspaper Metro.
However, Johan Göransson of the Court of Justice protected the accuracy of the tests: 'generally speaking, the risk of dissolving the child is low.
The higher of about 10% is the risk if a person is a little less than 18. "

By 20year, Anna Maria Orel took a great debut with 67.37.
Orel was the youngest of MM's youngest, and a cheerful woman assured me that he was hoping to fight for medals in the future.
The fight went well and got a good experience.
On the first test (64.80), I immediately took my average result, the second (62.80) risked too much and the third (67.37) was able to be clear, said Orel after the competition.
I was looking for my own emissions, and I'm really glad I found it.
Anna Maria surpluses of the MM debut ended good at the 18th.
The hate of Orelic didn't bother you because he trains the winter through the TTU Stadium.
"I'm scared," she said with a little bump.
The London Olympics was almost full of people, did Orel put people around him or was able to turn himself off?
I did, but I was positive.
Everyone says that's what it's like, that's it!
If you do, you can experience it.
On the Orel, he said he would be pleased with the MM debate and he was still waiting for a great deal of good competition: "I came here with the 32nd of the season with the final result, finished 18th.
That's a very good result.
I'm 20 years old and I'm an MMD, that's all that matters.
I take a good experience and sometimes I want to compete for the medals.
The governor of West Virina reported on party exchanges
The Western Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening at the meeting with President Trumpi to change the parties.
"like it or not, Democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"today I am going to tell you, being so much praised and thought... today I am going to tell you, Western virginium, that I can no longer help you as the governor of the democratic governor."
For the gathering, the cheapest triumphs of joy.
"so I will be a Republican of tomorrow," Annex Justice.
"as a trainer, I would tell you it's time to play another game."
A trump has allowed a great announcement before the gathering of Western Virginia.
The champ won 42 points in West Virginia, and justice did not support the Democrat's candidate Hillary Clinton.
The "Justice," which is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes states that it is owned by coal mines in five states and coal business quite from his father.
His value is approximately $1,59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) announced on Thursday evening to announce that "the Governor Justice Party exchange is another blow to the democratic party, which would rather prevent the country from making it better than working for it" again.
"in all 15 governors of the governor and the control of the lowest states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is just the most recent rejection of a party that is unstoppable and isunable to find a positive and interconnecting message," said RNC's representation in Ronna McDaniel's statement to CBS News.

Coe has praised the Russians for an honest apology for the anti-doping religion.
The international ninja Sebastian Coe, under his words, accepted the "Russian Thursday honest apology" for the anti-doping tribute, but reiterated that it is not time for the country to returnthe sport.
On the eve of the International World Cup, Dmitry Shyvarhtin said that it is right and has a firm goal of fighting doping.
He said "I'm sorry" from all the easy liters who have broken gold and silver-medals in the race. "
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress has voted in favour of maintaining the ban on competition, which was established in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest answer today, with a very fair presentation," said Mr Coe's journalists from the IAEA.
"the Terve Council and the Congress were pleased that the Russian alals itself had acknowledged that they had had quite difficult times and they would do anything possible to restructure the treaty."
According to Coe, he was pleased, in addition, that Russia accepted the criteria for its own reinstatement.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and there was progress, but Congress is supporting the proposal of the Working Party that now is not the time to withdraw Russia," said Coe.
"we must make every effort to normalise the situation within the next few months.
We have always approached the principle that we want pure athletes to separate, "she added.
Nineteen Russian light bulbs, meeting the strict criteria of the IAEA, will compete as neutral athletes in the London World Championships in London on Friday.
Mr Rune Andersen, President of the IAAF, said that Russia does not yet meet a number of predictions.
Following a report by the IAEA to the Council, he said to journalists in London that the doping check is still insufficient and that the trainers that have been banned are still at ease.
The electricity car revolution significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are winners and losers?
The light that the electricity car revolution substantially changes everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although the mines like Glencore can say that one place wins and the other ones lose, the smaller mining companies won't help.
At present, Glencore works from coal and oil, but in the future of the electric cars, there is a growing demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and niche.
This year, the UK, France and Norwegian governments have tightened their contributions in terms of the distribution of electric cars, allowing them to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
Now Volvo has known that they are planning to waive the internal combustion engine, and Tesla will create a cheaper Model 3 for the market.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts, cars are being sold more over two decades more than oil produced by oil.
For some metals, it changes everything ," said Capital Economics as the raw materials analyst Simona Gambranini Bloomberg.
We have already seen a great deal of influence on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has increased for years.
In electric cars, about three times more copper than in the standard car, Glencore announced.
More copper is needed in the charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribasi estimates that this will increase the demand for copper by around five per cent by 2025.
Growth in demand from electric car batteries means further lithium, cobalt, graphide and manganese.
Glencore gains from a growing trend in electricity cars and the world's largest cobber producer, the Jefferies Group forecast.
According to this company, Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals are victorious to the other electric cars.
The market responds to a changing trend.
This year, the London metal exchange rate of 70% has been fished.
It was 37%.
It is also responsible for 14% of the year, mainly due to economic growth.
The Glencore stock rose by 20% in London, having crossed the rival to the rival Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo Americani.
On the losers' side, lead companies like Recyclex and Campine have to adapt to a new age.
The main end of the lead is the batteries supplied by the supply of petrol and diesel cars with the flow.
Electric cars use lithium ion batteries.
"this is a serious risk to the plight of the lead, unless it is found to be a function to overcome the decline in demand," said Bank of America Merrill, Michael Widmer, leader of the metal-market analyser.
The impact of the lead on the price of the lead does not have the effect of showing the effects of the unruly trend.
Lead is 17 per cent of this year, and this is the best metal in the main industrial metals in London.
Investors see problems in the metal far from the future.
"I am not sure this is so bad for the girl, because cheap oil keeps the conventional cars in competition," said Herwig Schmidt, the CEO of the metal estate company Triland Metallica.
If the lead in demand falls, it will be slow.
It can happen in so much about 10 years.
In the meantime, the toughest emission standards mean that the demand for hybrids will increase, which depend on the advanced battery batteries developed in the start of the engines, will assess the international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel because a lighter car can only go further with electricity.
This is already explained by an additional 1.6 million tonnes of gross demand for 2013-2016 until 2016.
This represents 2.7% of the total aluminium world production.
This trend is likely to worsen, said Widmer.
Aluminium has increased by 13% this year, given that the growing demand by car manufacturers has led to the market deficit.
Steel manufacturers do not sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnologies for the production of mammalian hard drives.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe also seek to develop lighter alloys from the steel in order to resist the human being.
"the strong steel should be the answer to this development," said the Exane BNP Paris analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of the age of oil can also cause suffering for platinum.
The soil was about half of this precious metal diesel engine as catalysts, reported by Johnson Matthey.
"Pallas currently have a high demand for raw materials such as oil and platinum may not have much demand in the future," said Ms Natixise 's raw materials analyst, Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will change over the 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe the continued demand for diesel hybrids.
Mr Uncore's leader Marc Grynberg said that in 2025, more hybrids would continue to be auctioned by more hybrids.
In the 10 years' great hope of the platinum producers, Toyota has been developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motors in hydrogen based cars, which depend on platinum to produce hydrogen from hydrogen.
Yet, however, this technology has not yet legitimised itself.
"Dilis seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars," said the Exane BNP Paribasist Brunet.
German car manufacturers received a major setback in July, since the Stuttgart court was boating the use of diesel in a home town of Mercedes Benz and Porsche.
How the financing rules for football affect the transition of Neymar to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the uncontrolled spending of European football clubs will not prevent the start of the world record of Neymar from the Spanish football club in Barcelona, Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from the UEFA, a management body that is in the European game and which are able to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Meisters League tournament, wait for Paris Saint-Germention.
The FFP established by UEFA in 2011 means that the PSG must demonstrate at some point that the transfer of Neymar was financed without a huge loss.
In Barcelona, EUR 222 million (262 million dollars) were paid only for the fact that the Brazilians buy out of his contract, and the wages of Neymar are starting to reach tens of millions ofdollars per year.
Here are some financial aspects of the transfer of Neymar to the French club.
There is no doubt that PSGs will be able to come up with such money in the recruitment of Neymar and in its alphabetical rite, taking into account that the team will be financed by a dominantfamily in Katari.
The clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money in order to recruit players, but they need to balance it with legal income sources that enable them to come out with those in the football business.
He had the foundation for Michel Platini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs, who were successful in search of their success in large debts, are actually dealing with fraud and taking a risk of defamation if the banks or owners should give up their support.
From 2011 onwards, the FFP will focus on monitoring the losses of the FFP clubs.
This change means that the business model, which Roman Abramovich used to use in Chelsea in 2003, to buy a club with a potential, and then to pay big costs to improve the team and create a global brand, is more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year evaluation period of the FFP until 2018, clubs can bear losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini was disgraced by the presidency in 2015, his successor to UEFA's successor, Alexander Ceferin, is still committed to preventing overspending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will certainly continue to strengthen these rules," said the Associated Pressile Andrea Traverso, who is a supervisor of the UEFA FFP, last week.
Although the PSG paid for an overpurchase clause in the Region of Neymar, it is possible for them to divide this amount into shares for the purpose of the duration of the contract.
Mr Neymar concluded the five-year contract so that the transitional consideration could be demonstrated over the next five years of EUR 44,4 million over the next five years.
In the case of the first wave of the FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG along with Abu Dhab received the most serious sanctions on the neck.
A fine of EUR 60 million (at this moment) was set at EUR 60 million (currently EUR 82 million), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million and the club was required to limit the team of theMeisters League to 21 players during the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs who can try to outsmart the regulatory financial institutions, by blowing their income up through the companies involved in the club.
The company of Qatar may be sponsored by the PSGs, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to be superior to standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be regarded as an official income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the PSG support for Qatar was inflated.
It has been said that a certain proportion of Mr Neymar's PSG service may come from the ETF for the 2022 World Cup Management Committee through payments from Qatar.
However, the PSG and Qatar in 2022 deny that Neymari could become a member of the World Cup, and claim that UEFA regulators could easily expose this maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on PSGs mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in connection with any attempt to ignore the rules.
The people familiar with the situation spoke on Thursday that UEFA has not been a pre-emptive debate on the move towards Mr Neymar's transition with the PSGs.
They spoke with The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity would be assured as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PSG.
The latest published reports show that the PSG made more than EUR 10 million in a profit of around EUR 542,4 million during the 2015-2016 season.
Data on the last financial year have not yet been published.
The PSG hopes that the arrival of Neymar is well suited to sponsorship operations, distribution and distribution.
The club expects an increase of at least 30 per cent turnover in connection with the award of the contract.
Spain too, being clearly upset about the departure of one of the largest football stars, tried to stop the transition from Neymar, arguing that PSG would violate the FFPs.
"this is a clear" anti-doping incident with the club and country ," said President Javier Tebas in the Spanish newspaper AS, suggesting that the PSG is mainly owned by the Katarile.
An arsenal for Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports magnage, shares La Liga's warning that the state finances the club.
"this is a consequence of ownership rights, and it has completely changed the whole football landscape in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"if the club is owned by the state, it's possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of an honest game, since the state may have other ways or other interests that such a large player would represent the country. "

Today 50 years ago, a hurricane killer storm in Estonia, which runs the rooftops and windows from the houses.
The hurricane of the century, which caused major damage in particular to the West, to the Land, to the Land of Africa and to the Ripland, in particular to the storm of the century on 6 and 7 August.
The northwest Estonia had a speed of over 30 m / s for their days.
My old man ran out of the garden from a raging tree to the other and the plague to support them.
It was all dark and rugless like the end of the world.
Taamal was already besieged by roofs from the houses, reminded of the old lady Linda Kurova Haapsalus in Estonia in the interview given by Estonia in this interview.
Linda's husband saw how the garden he planted was collapsed.
But what are you going to do with the trees, where you can get that storm?
The sea came to the window, sprayed by the windows ," said Haapsalus on Kalda, who lived on the street.
The fact that the road was full of trees and the train of the railway station on the platform had flown 20-30 metres, saw the most of Linda in the same morning as it was only the next morning.
According to the local people, Paralepa had a tree in the back of the head, a few completely down, a few in half.
It all looked very depressing, the storm came from beautiful old trees to rap and with a bark like a war.
Western Virumaa was not suffering particularly hard by comparison with Western Estonia in August 1967, but the losses were large, written by the Virumaa during the year 2007.
Haapsalu Lossipark and Padise were wiped from the earth, but also the parks of our Kandi were severely damaged.
In Tallinn, the wind was measured to speed up to 35 metres per second, or approximately 130 km per hour.
There was a little girl who said, "Mom, Mom, Mama!"
The chickens are in the air and they can't get down! "," wrote Virumaa Official Journal.
In the village of Viljandia, the estate of the estate was destroyed during a storm so that it was subsequently decided to dismantle.
There was no objection to the Tür's ski jump hillbilly structures, which were no longer restored.
The Red Star, on 12 August 1967, wrote that the cleaning of towns and cities from the watered trees and their branches would be slow, and that the residents could play their part in cleaning.
The storm also suffered a lot of fertility, and the newspaper reports that "party organisations must be an incentive and mentor, both in order and in the form of a crop rotation."
One can speak of Orkanes if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m / s.
In Estonia, when Ruhnul was measured at a speed of 48 m / s.
On the island of Vaindloo, the size of the instrument could not have been measured correctly.
Secret bathing areas: night cleaning and poor coastline
The more cold summers also mean a smaller cleaning work in Tallinn.
"if there is, there are people on the beach, and if there are no people, there are no people," they have a beach janitor.
There are seagulls in North Tallinn Strom Beach.
They are offered by a low-reindeer trator, which is lower than the melody, which is plotted off by stripes.
As a matter of fact, the last seven centimetres from the depths of the sand, picking it out of it out of the sea charts and people abandoned: bottles of cigarettes, cigarettes and others.
People still come to the beach, whether or not the water is warm.
If there is a beautiful day, there are people on the beach, and if there are no people, then there are no people, "says a private company in Haaberst, Alexander Usov.
It's 6:30 and the beach is swinging at the beach, because at 8:00, the plats are good for the people.
Usov is at work post at 4:00.
After Strom, he is still keeping an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, the coast of Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pikakar.
The levels of Prüm have been reduced.
Years ago it was so much more.
People can now assess what is being done for them ," speaks Usov, who has cleaned the wrist for 15 years.
Before it was, when something new came up, it was broken by the next day.
Now we're keeping what's on the beach.
The price of a clean land
One of the most important works in Estonia is the cleaning of severed sea trash.
For example, at the beach of Pirita, it has to be transported to 400 000 tonnes for the beach season.
"this is an incredible amount," notes Usov.
The second largest category consists of municipal waste or all of which people leave behind.
There are eight large dumpsters in the county of Strom, which are needed three times a week, which are required to be emptied.
There's so many garbage.
However, the coldest summer weather has meant that the garbage is a fifth in less than otherwise.
The third category is the abandoned items.
Most of the time, these are cargo.
For this time, Usov has quenched a dozen model desks inside the sand.
They're waiting for the owners of the woodland on the beach.
"usually, they come out more, but it's a normal catch." Usov knows soon they'll find them in the sand soon enough.
The kids come to the beach and take the toys to sink them in the sand.
The Prüm is being torn apart.
Erika Scholz, a representative of the administrative services of Haberst, acknowledges that the work of the tractor is disturbing to the local authorities.
Müra, which runs from the night hours to the early morning, will interfere with the sleep of the neighbouring people.
It's impossible on the day of the day, but it's impossible.
There's gonna be a beach twice through the beach.
"if we don't, the part of the town will be fine."
But the goal is to pick up a Prickster and a Persian beach under the quality mark of the Priory of Strom.
"Europe has much more work in the Commonwealth of Estonia to be maintained," said Mr Scholz.
We've got more adrands and rocks, and it's harder to drive the sand.
But there will be fewer trash in our seas than in the rest of Europe.
Hearing that at the beach is the junkyard, Martin is stepping up with a lively journalist and cleaning worker around the corner of the Stroom, pointing out the current shortcomings of the shore.
There's an abomination of the morning.
The problem is with the birds and the bottles of the bottle, who have been pulling off the trash bags, says Martin.
Although it is hard to assume that people can change their traditional patterns of behaviour, Martin hopes that the government will do something about the rubbish dumps and put them on the leeches, for example, to prevent the birds from coming out on the news.
In general, Martin is pleased with the Gulf of Stroom.
I can see the town's taking care of it.
It has become more pleasant in children's fields, bleak and fresh asphalt.
There was a time that there was only one way to go on the roller skates, said Martin.
Ardehunter's findings in Stroom: coins, only coins
The period of the morning period has to be used by 40 years of Dimitri, who combed the coastline with a metal detector.
He does not believe that there will be anything at stake in the future today or in the future.
The Sea gods are not generous enough for that.
"I've been doing this for a year, and I haven't found anything worth it," reporting it to Dmitri.
As a hunter as a hunter, some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous nails are in the Dmitr's treasure bag, which later throws in the garbage.
Usually the coins.
"the Gold, the rings and the other are not always," is a treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain at the same level as the lack of economic growth and the increase of inflation have softened speculation in relation to the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth is stagnating as household incomes have put interest rates on expectations.
The Bank " s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has voted on 6:2 rates at 0.25% and fewer members demand an increase this month as slow growth has weakened the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank forecast growth of 1.7% in 2017 and its 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes persists, as inflation is expected to continue torise by 3% in the fall.
At the same time, the Bank also indicated that the rate of increase in rates over the next few years is necessary to contain the inflation of Brexiti and the financial markets may be necessaryto increase the expected increase in the cost of credit.
Members voted also in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammal package which was released as a result of the Brexiti year ago.
In February, the Bank will finalise a temporary financing scheme offering the banks the cheap financing, although it said that it would now be expected to be more than GBP 115 billion in the framework of this scheme, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision taken against the Mountain, the Bank states: 'the gross domestic product (GDP) will remain in force in the near future, as the difficult situation of the real income of households continues to affect consumption.'
On the basis of the above, it was reiterated that "a slight effort of monetary policy" and "somewhat more" is needed to mitigate inflation, and this "somewhat larger" than the markets have been expected.
The Börs are now predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that all kinds of hydro were gradual and limited.
The Bank " s reduced growth projections for this and next year will be compared to May 1.9% and 1.7%.
The projected growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained stable.
After that, the pound fell for the dollar and the euro.
The pound decreased by 0,5% to USD 1,31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to amend the changes is due to recent frustrating growth figures, which have suppressed the growing expectations of rising GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% of the previous three months to 0.3%.
The Bank says that growth is expected to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will start a little momentum.
The latest information on inflation in the Bank gave rise to a few reasons for the rising inflation and the wretched salary for households who are suffering from wage increases, saying that the situation would be a bit worse before improvements.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent the next few years of a hit on income, but the end of the three-year forecast is expected to have a noticeable return on wages.
Due to the pound, the economy will also stimulate a growing demand for British production, partly compensating for smaller consumers.
The decision will have to be made a year after the rates were taken in August at 0.25% after the shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden weakening of the pound.
According to the Bank, it is likely to take four years to make full life in terms of prices and the economy.
Before the bank's last decision, there was a growing demand for an increase in inflation, as inflation had increased pressure on households; in July, three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell by 2.6% in the previous month, compared with 2.9% in June, although the bank's message was expected to be expected, and in the coming months an increase will be expected again.
The Bank said that excessive growth compared to 2% was due to a completely weak pound.
Mr Montlake, leader of Coreco's mortgage broker, said: 'in the light of the recent decline in the current exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to be increasingly competitive, as the lenders want work and hope to end a year in a positive way.
The Börs seem to be particularly favourable for those whose current transactions are expected to be completed, as refinancing, often in charge and low rates, has become increasingly popular."
NHS is in writing of 10,000 people who developed a conflict with HIV.
Patients have since September access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after a battle has been taken over whether NHS should finance the medicinal product.
NHS England reported that public health now has an estimated 10 000 human exposure to 10 000 people during the initial three-year clinical trial (PrEP) - tablets that are administered prior to intercourse and have demonstrated a reduction in the infection risk for high risk populations by approximately 86%.
NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the appeal court upheld the Supreme Court " s decision of last year, according to which NHS is able to pay the PrEP for PrEP, despite the fact thatit was claimed that the medicinal product should be financed entirely by local authorities.
The NHS England CEO Simon Stevens welcomed this on Thursday as a "major new intervention," while the State Aid Fund (NAT) described it "a turning moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverson and Sheffield are among the first to be registered to people. In October, there is a further addition to the climate before theprogramme is being put in place by the end of April 2018 in England.
Pre-treatment prophylaxis (PrEP) is a hotline of HIV drugs that will be taken before course to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials suggest that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people with HIV infection.
Taking PrEP prior to intercourse means that there are sufficient numbers of medicines that prevent infection from HIV in the human body.
Such medicinal products may be taken every day or no later than two hours before intercourse.
Candidates who are suitable for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV or receive treatment.
Clients identify appropriate people who are willing to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender and those with HIV in antiretroviral therapy.
People living in England and who have chosen their family doctors there will also be able to register their requests for participation in the local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The programme pays 10 million pounds and NHS England signed a contract to get medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by collecting the clinical evidence to whom the product is intended and how it is consumed and applied in the big picture.
Stevens said: 'this new massive intervention should complement and leverage a broad and increasingly successful anti-HIV fight.
This is another milestone in the length of three decades of fighting for one of humanity's biggest health problem. "
Deborah Gold, CEO of NATO, said, "This is a turning moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted at those needing it and belonging to the risk group, will offer an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool, which is individually manageable and independent of the negotiation with a partner, thus improving many lives.
We welcome this announcement from the warm. "
The CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, Ian Green, said: 'now it is essential to ensure that the clinical trial is conducted quickly across the country and that no members of the HIV crossgroups will be excluded.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial has been obtained, we are on our way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of contacting HIV.
Mr Hodgson, Minister for Public Health, said: 'the start of a clinical trial by PrEP is a very welcome and very long overdue delay after the delay of the month and the failure of the government " s feet.
These facts show how major changes can be made to HIV prevention and the elimination of its life-changing infection.
This clinical trial leads us to a step closer to a complete understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is put in place as soon as possible across the country to protect people with HIV exposure and to take us in a step closer to the development of HIV in society. "

Living in high life - semi-floor and smart designer lines have changed this little Earls Courti apartment to home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate estate innovator, traded his big Knightsbridge home in 2014 against Earls Court's apartment.
This is the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace and the fact that Joanne has not packed his bags and sold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"before that, I lived with a former partner in Kightsbridge, much more on the surface," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something that would be the same to my price.
I was shown this Earls Court's apartment and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day. "
From the first visit, this is a 93-square metre apartment through a complete innovation shed.
At the beginning, it was in a bedroom with a sophisticated configuration to get to the bedroom, walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add to the store room and half the floor to take advantage of the high ones.
"I wished for high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
They were my demands, "he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi at the Notting Hillis of the architectural and designer Duck & Shed to use the 3.8 m above and to create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to set up a half-level where to stand up.
Erfan had to approach it in a creative way.
"the metal structure is quite sophisticated," explains him.
"we have to rearrange the premises, so they're based on each other without a bow.
This was not just the construction of the platform, but we used the steel structure to ensure that the height of both the upper and the lower space would be correct. "
This arrangement allowed Erfanil to create a room with two full altitude rooms with many dramatic elements in the room.
From the semi, the old age is open to a glamorous dwelling from the Retrouvius window.
The golden furniture, the silver details and the retrohending Serge Mouille symbol underline the space of style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatrics, spatial and light saturation.
In the middle of the hallway, the mirrors have been added to the size of the mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the window of the window with the mirror leaves the window of the window opening.
In the first place, a reflector provides a reflector on the deposit to all Joanne dinners and a glass requirement.
In the case of life support, the magic will be able to shut down the kitchen if it is not used, creating an image of a glamorous room.
There's nothing new about the kitchen.
In this kitchen, however, there is a unique circumstance that we're dealing with a garage uprising door.
"it was a bit of a projection of design," explains Erfan of steel reinforced from the MDF.
"it's a counterweight, which is why it would be very simple if you put it up."
Thanks to the room and the storage of the storage room, Joanne now has 16 extra meters, an extra bedroom, and a better apartment plan.
"in the end, the floor space is what you are selling - or what gives value to real estate," "Mr Erfan.
"a real estate agent walks into an outdated form and makes calculations based on the floor of the floor."
Here they have been able to increase the floor surface, while using quality materials which add to the room luxury.
"materials are the ones you touch, which will help to create an emotional bond with their home," says Erfan.
"you won't fall in love with the electrical cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the heart of the heart glow. "
It shows that the good design and the increased area will help to do something amazing from the normal apartment.
In fact, they may even make a wish not to leave as it is with Joanne.
The main character Dane Jensen is the Chicago skyscraper bounty hunter who competes with a colleague for promotion.
It doesn't matter how it's made of money, which makes all kinds of ethics.
Your wife and three kids can only see the guy early in the morning and late.
In the first half of the film, I think it's the "The House of the House" business "version - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's call name is similar.
What the film has done, however, the most important element of the film business is, and the moralising intention of the filmmakers is increasingly starting to look.
Becoming a life-changing experience becomes the lead son of a child's disease of cancer.
There is a need to make a choice between work and family life.
The son of the Armotech will put his father in a walk to the great buildings of Chicago to think of real important things, such as religion, good, love, not even the disaster of the twin sectors.
After the third scene, where the son of a son opens his eyes, it is felt that the film makers must be able to cry from the target audience, because even the most precious viewer will not be able to keep the tears back in the face of a cute cancer boy.
When a son falls into a coma and his condition seems to be hopeless, my father will finally understand the moral integrity of his work and do a good deed for a decent old man.
Now I'm betting myself with myself - when the film is happy, I'm gonna reward my temper after the movie if I'm wrong, but I can take it from at least one of the surprises.
There will be doubt for a moment that I will be left out of coffee, when the husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man is in slow motion in the hallway of the hall.
However, the son has grown miraculously, and even though his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be positive, because now it is time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can predict the end of the American drama!
On the true honor, the film is well designed, all the elements necessary to do so are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and morals beautiful: money is not the most important in life.
This movie will bring me well.
The new Staff Commissioner intends to limit President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will actually be doing it for real.
In that case, he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit President Trumpin's flow of information, including news, in the hope that it would keep the top in a quiet water.
There's a broken reporter from Josh Dawsey:
"when the White House new staff chief John F. Kelly summed up with high officials on the first day of duty, he brought out the key problem with President Donald Trump in the White House, whichhe planned to resolve the poor information to the President's hands.
Kelly said to officials that the information had to be dealt with, either on paper or in meetings, as the president would make better decisions if they were to share good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but the others have tried it, and they've failed to stack Trump in his media consumption tracking.
President Trumpi's relationship with television is over decades behind, and now that he is in the White House, his telescopic habits have nowhere to be lost.
"when the candidate Trump was angry with the media for the media, it was paid to show him that he was also honest," said former campaign adviser, Sam Nunberg, in February, Politico.
Politico Tara Palmer said, at the time, that "the six former campaigners told us that Trump's Twitter exercise would be key to ensuring that his personal media consumption contains a stable song."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's use of Twitter has never been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign members know something that the rest of us do not know that Trump's inventions would have been even worse without their intervention.
We'll probably never know about the feds that Trump didn't post.
If his helpers were able to save him or a couple of times out of trouble, their ponds were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from causing the poems.
Part of the problem is that, in a White House of competing clips, people are trying to promote their own interests without exception, conveying the Trump material that supports their world views, but it may not always be credible.
For the entire story, Politico wrote about the descendants of the Mayan incarceration to feed the president of the most strategically questionable value.
One of the examples described by the reporter, Shane Goldmacher, is as follows:
"now the current and former Trump will state that Trump may react to negative press, especially with harmful interference, with an explosion, with a view to identifying the source of their source.
This is how it happened at the end of February when someone gave the President a happy copy of the article GotNews.com on the Internet provocative website in connection with Charles C. Johnson, which accused Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, that he said he was a White House "source of a series of information."
It doesn't matter that Johnson has been blocked from Twitter because of his meddling, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence, or that he or she has also reported and withdrawn from the past.
The trump counted the article and began to inherit the subject of the subordinate Walsh. "
The Goldmacher added that the staff chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and head of the White House Office, Rob Porter, have tried to set up a system for the management and document of Trumpin'sperformance documents.
How did it work?
Kelly's trying to do the exact same thing three months later.
Perhaps his Priest will be a more effective leader, but Trump is still impulsive and his helpers are still competing for the influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from the foreigners of the world will not have to obtain permission to do so.
There's a lot of foreigners in downtown Tallinn.
The ones the Fighter came up with witnesses to play in the old town without authorization of the government.
We found three street musicians who had brought along the same dogs as many dogs.
It was clearly apparent that musicians and scented musicians were surgeons who could use a shower.
Despite the violence, the only woman in the company was playing a song with a funny rhythm, while one man was standing next to her with three balls and he called the passions closer.
The third man was sitting next to one of them by one of the backpack and smoked in a heart attack.
Their three dogs didn't let their passing people get distracted.
Noem has been played on the streets for both pleasure and money.
The purpose of the company was to collect the ticket money on the same day as the ship travelling to Finland.
On the question of the question of whether or not they asked the castle for muscular use in the old town, you lost the heads of Noem and Bob.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we never stay in the same town for more than a day or a couple, and most of all, you'll give it a month or something.
There's no reason to pay, Bob explained.
When we got back to the Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw two women at the musicians and make them go.
The company moved to the crosshairs of the back bags and dogs to the crossroads of the Viru Center.
On the street of Viru, there were three Polish young men, one of whom played the violin, the second of the clarinet and the third had been the only one leading to the electronic piano.
"we are here to provide people with entertainment to disseminate music and joy and to serve money for fuel and residence," explained the trio pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware of the fact that the government is required to be authorised.
"of course we don't have it," he said he was joking.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there's no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we'll go somewhere else, but try it, "she added."
Eesti Pank bought a debt of EUR 149 million for the euro area central banks in the framework of the monetary financing programme in the euro area, a central bank bond portfolio increased to EUR 4.36 billion.
The Central Bank has no more detailed information on the purchases.
The Bank of Estonia, Hardo Hansson, has explained that the Eurosystem central bank treasury plan covers three different purchasing programmes: financial sector covered bonds (covered bonds),ABS and public debt (PSPP).
The central bank will buy together bonds on the market to encourage debt securities to reinvest money elsewhere.
The impact of the purchases will lead to lower risk assets and will motivate investors to take greater risks.
In the general case, each central bank will buy its own government bonds in the framework of the public sector bond purchasing programme, without any purchases by other countries.
Since the Estonian country has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank is doing the so-called replacement purchases within the limits of the volume allocated to them.
In those countries where the provision of debt securities is limited, the central banks will also shop in those countries where the provision of the corresponding bond bonds is limited.
The Bank of Eesti Pank will normally buy the debit cards of the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank will buy bonds in the framework of an asset purchase programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, the Electricity Bonds were also acquired, but in June 2016 Eesti Pank was no longer to buy the Power of Power.
In the name of the euro area central banks, from June onwards, the Central Bank of Finland purchases both the Ivory and Eesti Energia Bonds.
Travelers ignore the trench and return to the "millionaires division"
Some of the most wealthy houseowners in the West Midlands have entered into a fierce confrontation with determined pilgrims, who have ignored the authorization of the countdown in order to winback the field of their fleece.
The travelers have parked their 20 trailers on the field of the wealthy "billionaire Rangers," who were baptized on the side of Solihulli Street.
They have returned with horses, children and lorries, after they just got kicked out of there in May, not to be disturbed in a ditch, to stop their intrusion into a council.
The group found the weak spot in the guards, squeezing its vehicles on the side of the unrestrained parts which were left to walk.
The rabid people are passionate to the Solihulls, saying the Council is "useless" to deal with the problem.
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there Monday night after they got out of Bentley Heathi, where they threw the passions with stones.
The council has to be disgraced for them to take action, because they're useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they got time to go and now they're back.
They came to see them last night, probably even more today. "
He added: "the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such matters, obtaining long obstacles to protect their parks.
I am on the street of Streetsbrooki, and I am not pleased that I must continue to pay the power of the emoluments, if the council can't even stop such a thing. "
One of the local inhabitants, who wanted to remain anonymous, said, "This is ridiculous. We just saw how the last of these travelers left, and there's a new invasion going on.
This time the number has grown and the grassland has even seen the horse. "
"we are aware that there is an intolerable campsite in the country in the area of the Streetsbrook Road, and we are working with Solihulli police. We are implementing the necessary legislative measures to get them to move as quickly as possible.
In the collection of evidence, it is very helpful if as far as possible the widest possible number of local residents report any form of antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police, calling the number 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation when we present the case to them. "
Weekend Festival is also visited by the Minister for Culture Indrek Saar, who is pleased that Estonia has been able to bring real world names.
The question is that Weekend is so important for the Estonians, Saar says that it should be asked from all those who have been fully enjoying the festival for three days.
However, he notes that the real thing has come true to the Persians.
"looking at the level of artists that have been brought back to Estonia," that they bring home the absolute top names of this musical genus - that is often the case that we do not have ," saysMinister for Culture.
What kind of festivals are artists, however, will Saart speak most of himself?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for old people like me, there is certainly one of the most experienced artist Armin van Buuren, who stood up last night.
In his record, every one of us is, at some point, sophisticated, "he says," he says. "
But he will bring out a number of names, such as Chainthia, DadaIu5, Knifeparty.
Of course, we own the Estonian leaders: starting with the YOUTP, and they can be counted as a whole series.
In fact, the known names of the known names are very big, "he says.
Take a look at the Night's Video video!
Audi " s renewal of the vehicle " s renewal in the context of the criticisms that have been hit by car manufacturers up to 850 000 diesel vehicles
The day before the Audi " s announcement, BMW said that a software application was offered by more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the Chairman of the BMW, the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities, including BMW's hometown in Munich, which have considered the prohibition or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million passengers in Europe were updated to reduce exhaust emissions from diesel engines.
The company didn't describe these operations as a recall.
European car manufacturers are eager to use diesel vehicles in Europe and in the USA to help comply with the CO2 emissions regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered to be a carcinogen and may lead to asthma.
The cost of the equipment to neutralise the emissions of diesel vehicles for the automotive industry is increasing, making it difficult to maintain price stability for cars.
While the German car manufacturers are under close scrutiny, the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will also be accused of detending signs of powerful car manufacturers.
Companies are trying to avoid duplication of Volkswagen mistakes, which is silent on the use of husbands, which enabled them to adapt the exhaust gas supply to comply with the regulations forthe time of the car, but they have failed under normal driving conditions.
A number of Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States and others are on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month was the former manager of the thermodynamics sub-unit of the Audi engine development department in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may go to justice in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was drawn up in a criminal investigation concerning Volkswagen in Germany, when the authorities charged the installation of the Audit System to circumventthe European emission requirements for emission quantities, thereby extending the investigation, which had previously been focused on the United States.
Audi's involvement in research could be a major blow to the Volkswagen producer to generate a disproportionate share of the profits of Volkswagen.
The Estonian schools will receive EUR 20 000 for European Union flags.
The Ministry of Education intends to purchase the European Union flags for the Estonian schools by 1 September.
A total of 105x158 centimetres can reach the 570 educational institutions of the European Union.
Flags are intended to be exponentially in indoor spaces, they need to be carried out indoors in a high-quality paper with an hourly signal, mediated by the ERR News Portal.
There is also a record of the Estonian School in Estonia for the purpose of issuing the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of the Republic of 570 is EUR 20 000 or one flag in the Ministry of Education to be EUR 35.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes the growing danger situation in Mexico
The Riodoce employees usually gather on Wednesday to look at the plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, which are soiled by organised crime, corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars.
But today, they are in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss our security.
They say it's important to change their routine.
Two senior writers are discussing which seems safer: to bring the children into the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009 or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the top of the room: 'enemies', 'neutral', 'allies'.
They ask the reporters in every column of the column to provide evidence that no evidence is necessary, enough of the impressions and inner feelings.
In the case of government or cartels, drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being a common list of villains who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos inMexico.
The violence is not a break-in, and the more bodies accumulate over the country, most of them represent journalists, according to the Committee of the Protection of Journalists, since they have been appointed by President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 at least 25. There are 589 journalists after attacks and threats under national protection and have been killed for at least seven journalists in seven states during this year.
The latter include their editor and inspiration, the co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"Surim is a mistake to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drugs violence.
His absence is deeply felt, though the presence of his presence may be perceived anywhere in the Riodoce building of the Riodoce building there is a large picture of the average finger of Valdez, along with "Justice" and the two 30s reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which depicts his smiling glasses face or his distinctive banker.
The meeting will take place in less than two months after he died. The reporters are discussing common traumas, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special public prosecutor's office was created in 2010 for the handling of journalists' cases, the Committee of the Protection of Journalists has only had two cases of judicial responsibility.
As most of the year's history of drugs trafficking and organised crime, the number of which amounts to thousands, the perpetrators of journalists rarely reach justice.
The action of Riodoce continues to reflect violence in Sinaloas, even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now more dangerous.
Ibarra said that there would be a lot of benefits without the murder of the assassins and the safety meeting.
"it's very stupid to waste your time in this meeting," he says.
"to Sen, until the reason is known, you are mistrust of everyone."
Valdez left the state capital of the Riodoce office in Culiacan on 15 May.
He only managed to drive a couple of blocks before two men stopped him with a red Toyota Corolla. He was forced to get out of the car and he was shot 12 times. It is expected to be named after a newspaper, which is translated into the 'twelfth river'.
An armed man drove out of Valdez's car and crashed in the neighborhood.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He became a woman and two adult children.
The rumors are spreading freely in Culiac.
However, there is only a silence on Valdez.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the most bloodious battles of the country because the rival clicks are fighting for the execution of a power vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in the streets of Sinaloa every single day, a man or many people will be shot or that the cemetery is enslaved in a dilated two-time series of drug kings, bigger than the homes of many living homes.
Let us forget, for a moment, that the time of peace refers to the fact that only one cartel is leading to a state management of valuable ports and routes to the United States of the United States.
Despite all of this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work, the co-founder of Riodoce and the President of the House Ismail Bojorquez (60) feel that he was unable to defend his friend.
He believes that the killing was driven by two mistakes.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with the Speaker of the Guzmans in competition and war with Damaso Lopez.
This piece of paper could get angry with the suspect gang members who bought all the copies of this edition as soon as they got into the newspolls.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after the raid on the other newspaper in one of the other newspapers had been recorded.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and it was seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived in life for so long, that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as a vet reporter at Noroeste in 2003, when he joined the five collections to create Riodoce, selling $50 units.
Bojorquez says Sinaloas "was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem."
In time, the newspapers rose in time with their courageous and honest reflection, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish Christmas studies without censorship and commited to read stories that they could read about stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the formation of Riodoce, the newspaper won a prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for Latin America's recognition.
In the same year, Valdez won the Association of Journalists for the Freedom of Journalism as an award for his courage to follow Mexico's drug line anywhere in the country where it leads.
He confessed openly that he was scared.
"I want to move on," he said against AKK's prize.
Last October, he said on a television channel in the Rompeviento TV interview that the drug trade was a way of living in Sinaloa.
"you have to take a mission that involves another opportunity to play dumb as a journalist."
I don't want to be asked what I did when I faced so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on. "
The Riodoce collector misses Valdez, a funny man who threw up like a sailor, a friend who was divided by a kindly embrace and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They came to her routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office across the way to El Guayabo's bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love became fatal.
His death has made them have doubts about how best to do your job and stay alive.
"they don't like the Yankees of their wives, their children, their legitimate business, their secret skies, which are used for the transportation of narcotics."
Bojorquez said "Nei things weren't to be touched."
The result is, even in the best times, strong self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting my instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay out of it.
The problem is that the smell can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier.
He and others say that there are no more old rules in Sinaloas, just as they do not apply to the toxic mix of smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The terrain is constantly evolving.
In the room where the Riodoce employees met for security training suddenly, no more mobile phones were allowed; a few days prior to this, it was revealed that only the spyware sold to governments had been used to observe journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, there were two police officers looking for a relief from a 40-degree heat.
The government appointed them to guard the Riodoce office, located in a quadruple building in Culiacan in the middle-class neighborhood.
Some reporters were wondering whether these policemen belong to the 50 percent of the police that the governor himself has made unreliable.
Several months have passed since the reporters have traveled to mountainous counties where control is de facto in the hands of the narcotics.
Riodoce's edition of this week's edition dealt with three main stories.
One of them was the murder of a former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloas.
In addition, they had a revelation of government spending spending on the governor's hometown.
A group of people was abducted from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan in a quarter from the DA's office.
There was no official statement about who was abducted or how it happened, so it had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows the restaurant has in place, so asto the mind of the drug dealers and the authorities.
A reporter found out about the public documents that the restaurant was registered to a politician, who is owned by the powerful institution of the Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominatedall levels of politics for almost the last century.
In recent times, there have been widespread accusations of corruption in cases of corruption within the governor of the IRP.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write earlier incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman who wore nickname El Chapo got away from the military.
In the past few months, the readers would have searched for Valdez's column to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"in the past we have known what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose sticky body structure has served him a nickname for El Flaco.
"now all communication channels have broken with our sources."
The Valdez office has become a storage room for the bridges and stickers that protest against the killing of journalists, and there has been some editorial staff that they never expected to expect in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of bridges and headed to the local DA's office next morning for an order of another journalist.
Salvador Atus disappeared in Western Michoacan, three days after the assassination of Valdez.
A burnt body has been found and officials said it was based on DNA tests on him.
Journalists have become more popular across the country and have been criticised for organised protest on pavement and buildings as "SOS press."
On that day, Mr Bojorquez is in Washington, trying to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and to kill them because of telling the truth.
After that he begged him to divert the government's activities elsewhere, worrying that anger was influenced by its objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are "restricted" to organised crime, co-perpetrated public officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narcotics," he wrote that reporters are not only killing narcotics, but also by the hands of politicians and security forces who are in the possession of organised crime.
In the last year, more than half of journalists assaulted the police and civil servants last year.
"in Mexico, you die, because they want you to be silent," said Ramirez.
The Murders appear to have permeable influence.
No one forgets a blogger, Maria Elizabeth Macias's death in the northernmost state of the border, six years ago.
His body was found with a letter, which was probably signed by a cartel in Los Zeta, "I'm here for my reporters."
Next to his buried head, there was a computer navigation and headphones.
Some editions have decided to close their doors, for example the newspaper El Norte in the North Pole in Chihuahuas following the assassination of their correspondent Miroslava Breach on March 6.
The others will shoot like they made a newspaper in El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after their manager's murder in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly spoke to the drug cartels publicly on the front page, "What do you want from us? ."
Some journalists have fled the country or even from the country.
This is a terrible decision.
It is hard to find a job in the exile, and they still have to play the streets in order to avoid threats.
And sometimes behind them, as probably happened to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four ladies in 2015 in a Mexico apartment three months from the Veracruz band.
Those who remain in place and continue to work will have to dance with risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who ever wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexico is on the way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
One of the recent Friday midnight, when the newest number was already locked, the founders of Riodoce were sitting in front of the office in front of the office and roasted beer when suddenly all the phones started to be vibrating.
In the city of Rannah, there were 19 people who were killed in fire exchanges between the rival gangs and the security forces.
The war continues to be driven by a number of cartels which have been found in a number of cartels.
From the top of the sidewalk, reporters put on a news mobile phone using the Riodoce website.
The front of the next day needed a change.
The Sireenid had just another fire in the area.
Bojorquez is looking at the officers on guard to see if they'll be vigilant.
When they were scared, they never showed it at least.
The founder of the newspaper, under the massive portrait of his average finger, seen all of Sinalos, delivered the Riodoce employees in his footsteps.
"how could we ever think about shutting down," said Bojorquez, "when he was killed on the same day that Javier was killed, he asked me to send him to the street to report?"
A dinosaur was using protective treasures to avoid the enemy.
At first glance, it sounds like a statue, though quite frightening.
Scientists have now made the first findings in connection with the unbelievable rhino size of the canada well found, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisaof the dinosaurs."
It was perfectly preserved that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered by his armor was a reddish brown colour, and his past had been somewhat "complex."
In a magazine published by Currents Biology described the creature as "the best preserved armor" ever found and "one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
In the case of Fossilil, this is a new array of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of a critic age, 110-112 million years ago.
This incredibly good survival of the people who describe it "truly remarkable."
A vegetarian covered by this armor is the most advanced type of derived fossils that have ever been found in the National Geographic magazine.
On 21 March 2011, it was found in Shawn Funk when he extracted Suncor Millenium mines in North Alberta Canada near Fort McMurray.
He caught something that didn't remember the surrounding rock and decided to look closer.
The fossil was sent to Royal Tyrrell's paleontologist.
The next six years were designed to dig an animal out of 250 pounds of land (1100-kg).
After all this hard work, the final result is now finally prepared for the public.
"if you squandered your eyes, it can almost be believed that he is asleep," said the leading author Caleb Brown, a researcher in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is being exponentially.
"this is going in the history of one of the finest and most preserved dinosaur as the Mona Lisana of dinosaurs."
When studying his skin, the researchers found that this vegetarian, which is covered with armor, and reminds me of a walking tank, is likely to pose a significant threat to the food supply ofmeat.
A dinosaur with the many armor used red and white protective treasures to hide from predators, and applied the eclipse techniques known as the shadow of the shadows and which are also used bymany presentations of modern animals.
This enabled experts, according to experts, to better integrate into their surroundings and avoid their enemies, as larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him.
This figure of 110 million years of nodosaurus became the first news in May, and is now visited by Royal Tyrrell's paleonontologist.
The reporters have now studied the creature and named this name Borealopelta from the mark Mitchell of the Museum of Museum, who was the famous team of more than 7 000 hours to expose the animal to the poor.
Thanks to the amazing preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and the international scientists have been able to document the shape and size of the scales on the body.
They have detected an eclipse - a common method of protection in the country of origin, which means that the upper side of the creature was darker than the lower.
While the shade is common, the findings come as a surprise, since Borealopelta is much larger than the animals currently living in the shadows.
It suggests that the dinosaur was actively involved in the dinosaur dinosaur dinosaurs that evolution was preferable to an eclipse instead of confrontation.
However, most of the animals that use modern anectomobiles - such as deer, zebras or lovers - are much smaller and more vulnerable as recovery, suggesting that the nodosaurus would really work hard to survive.
"the vigorous hunting of the gardened dinosaur with high and many scales of armor shows the danger of being predators from dinosaur dinosaurs," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of Soomuste also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was the red brown skin.
Scientists continue to investigate to get clues about this life, including the preserved content of this gut, to find out what the animal ate for his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river in the death of the death, thereby reaching the stream of the stream, where he went to the bottom of the ocean before the back of his back.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it was now in South Florida and the rivers and oceans were most likely to be much further inside the interior than it is now.
"this nodosaurus is truly remarkable, as it is fully covered with preserved armoured skin, while maintaining the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"as a result, the animal is almost identical to that in a rudimentary age.
It doesn't have to be much imagination to reconstruct it - it's just enough to cry out your eyes and feel like she's sleeping. "
The time of the crisis was the time when the vast two legs were wandering down on earth, of the carnivorous dinosaurs - the tonsils.
Although the rex of all of them, Tyrannosaurus, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, it could be hunted by some of his horrid precursors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11,5 metres) and a long and six tonnes monster.
Scientists, whose recent findings are published by Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was drowned into the sea after death, and it mutated in the mud.
Olevus was discovered by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011, when he was mine in Millenium mines in North Alberta Canada near Fort McMurray.
At the museum, it is the most preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and scales, and it is a complete cone of the mixture to the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 legs (five metres) long and weigh up to 3000 kg (1300 kg).
There were two 20-inches a length of the shoulder in this shoulder.
The scientists believe that this gardening vegetation was carried out by the current West Canada, up to a river swimming in the open sea with pride.
But the cemetery in the area of the dinosaur helped to preserve its most marvelous detail in its scales.
The rainfall of this particular specimen has been so well preserved that the armored scales of the mysterious armor along the head of the dinosaur continue to cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine, "The degree of this survival is as rare as the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it feels.
Ferrous skin reds are still covered in the skull of the animal in the skull.
The right front leg lies beside her and the five of the toes are stretched upwards.
"I can count the scales on her stable."
How did one of the acts find the answer to the question of "whose streets?"
On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell became a complete shock.
Every day after the New York travel, it sat in a rented room in a rented room in a rented room on the phone, straightening Facebook.
She got into the post of a school date after her own school date.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid, and he's still lying in the street."
He was confused why no one else had posted this information, which is why he closed on Facebook and opened on Twitter.
Pidemega @ TheePharoah " s postal services had been repeatedly divided on his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis region sent in real time to Michael Brown, unarmed for the death of an 18-year-old black young man who killed a white officer in Ferguson in Missouri.
He posted a picture of the Brown life of the body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"this is crazy," he meant to be Ferrell's own.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away, but he saw the sparks again later this time, which reported the gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
The photographs were distributed from the police and the screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept the label, "The Ferguson police just killed my unarmed boy! ."
He looked in real time, where a cop was standing in front of a barbershop group of protestors.
In a second video, one second officer said he said the gun and the shepherd, "I'll kill you all... Animals. "
Ferrell will remember how he felt like, "This is unusual."
"this is not a kind of murder that we are used to, and what we could call typical."
At that moment, I felt the creeps.
I was angry and cried. "
He booked a return trip and drove home the next day.
After 9:00, he went to his dad to pick up his six-year-old daughter, and he decided to go to Ferguson next morning.
What was going on with Ferrell and Ferguson next three years is at the core of a new documentary on "Whose Streets?" ('Whose streets? "), which is presented in cinemas on 11 August.
This is a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and shit from the point of view of those people who live in this community, and who filled the answers to the calls for thestreets.
When Ferrell was with his daughter - who was wearing a flower with a flowery and a suitable crown in his head - to Ferguson, they talked again about a question that had before the morning several times before that morning - the black experience and the living conditions.
"do you remember when I taught you how a black community had to fight for his rights?" Looks like he's asking himself.
"we're going to Ferguson now because the police killed the 18-year-old boy and it's not right."
"I couldn't take him," said Ferrell later.
"what is happening now is the culmination of what has happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He needs to learn about the activist and the organization, and also feel the different layers of the black experience and living conditions, and what we need to do to be free and released.
Even if I manage to grow him, so that he doesn't personally move into a cruel racism, he's no different from another black girl.
I feel like I'm doing him a little favor when I protect him from the world. "
The first stop they did when we arrived at Ferguson was on the way to South Florissant - from the police station across the road, which had become a certain type of campsite, where the activists were expecting news of a police officer, Darren Wilson, who were never charged with the charges.
Over there, Ferrell and his daughter joined the local business owner who made the southern showers.
They put food bags together and helped to share them with the protestors.
For Ferrell, it was slow to take a statue of a new type of activist.
"my activist was completely transformed after 9 August," he said, pointing out that when he was a student at the University of Louis, he was the president of the student of Louis, and focusedon food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I didn't have any organizing experience.
It's all just a setup. "
Weeks later, a film with the co-director Sabaah Fox, during the course of the evening's evening's demonstration.
Folayan said that her and the film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was going on.
In Ferrell's head, the question is, "Are you trying to document what is going on or find a story that can be used?"
Such scepticism was the result of countless numbers of cases where people - often Caucasians - come to the community and seek to reap the benefits of its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: 'we have heard that people born and raised in Ferguson will not be heard, and we wanted to do it differently.'
Folayan had already punched his hands with a co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist who was a well-known activist in connection with the prisoners of death.
His involvement changed the project to the binding Ferrell and another six for the other, who was the "Whose Streets?" The team after Brown shot at Brown for years.
"in this documentary, no one speaks for us or us, but we speak to ourselves," said Davis.
"to me, it was important to me how these people were depicted, as it would be so portrayed to me."
While the goal was not to focus on the Ferrell experience - it was to be shown that the movement was not about the salvation of the salvation, but to the community ', as Folayan said, it wasthe most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" Surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love with his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing the first time she'd seen the story.
"but I realized that there must be some vulnerability to the trafficking of the black people of the black people."
Furthermore, Ferrell's story highlights and re-puts the role of the black homosexual woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three beginnings of the movement in the social media in the wake of the murder of a black teenage teenage teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, the Black LivesMatter, are homosexuals.
"in a leading role black homosexual women have kept moving," said Ferrell, "and that is precisely because we have to fight on many fronts all the time.
Black homosexuals will have to carry the whole burden. "
Folayan agreed, noting that "movement really does keep black women alive, and many of them are black homosexual women."
He claims, however, that "it is not one of the types of equal opportunities," Ferrell was not the center of the film because of his identity.
"he was a man with the right energy," he said.
"but it's not a coincidence that he was right on the front of the chest, because a black homosexual as a homosexual as a homosexual as a homosexual, there's a lot at stake.
His energy can be seen through the screen. "
Meanwhile, news cameras are long gone from Ferguson, but racial connections between the community and the police are still fragile.
The conditional sentence imposed on Ferrell during the demonstration of the road will still be for another 2.5 years.
He describes the social policy climate in the region that it calls home, just a "enormous amount."
However, he still attaches to an important mantra he has eaten in the memory of the time he went back to Ferguson three years ago.
"our duty is to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We have to love each other and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains. "
About 7, how about after the Weekend party for a hangover?
Some of the toughest husbands, after a drink of a napkin, they're gonna have to get the hell out of that, that's all it takes.
Or based on "avoid the hangover, stay drunk."
But it's just inevitable deferment and health.
What can you do to make you feel better in the morning and get over as painless as possible in the morning?
Drink some water.
On top of the alcohol, after a big party this morning... or even if possible instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluids in the use of alcohol, it has to be returned somehow.
In combination with water, the mineral substances are washed out of the body and it is good to drink mineral water.
As long as it is often irritated, it is particularly good when it is hot or slightly oppressed.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure it wouldn't be worth breaking the trees with a hangover - it could be a fatal wrong decision.
But a simple walk helps to remind the body again what it feels like to be alive.
Lying in the tent and sleeping in a hangover is a better way to get better.
Give the body the power back slowly and carefully.
If you're going to vomit from yesterday's yoga, I'm sure you're not trying to reload a big fat steak.
Start with, for example, a fresh juicy in which the use of wood chips in your body is quietly placed on the market.
You know, when you're in the middle of lunch, you might want to try, like, a wedding.
And a little later.
- Outside coffee.
This diuretics release your body from the last of the water.
Like already said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller for the night of the hangover, your liver will have to deal with alcohol as well as paracetamol or ibuprofen and lose its performance.
That's how you ruin your liver even more and the hangers are worse than ever.
Plus, you don't stay in the body for a long time anyway.
If you take the painkiller in the morning, don't do it on an empty stomach, it irritates your already rained stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you get along with yourself.
It's sort of like walking, but walking doesn't have an orgasm.
The physical effort should be moderate in the physical effort during the hangoon.
Be kidding.
Talk to friends with friends of friends, make a simple foolishness and laugh in a friendly way, both for yourself and for others.
A joke and a laugh may not wake the poker, but I'm sure it's got more fun with them.
There's a hangover all over anyway!
Northwestern professors and the employee of the University of Oxford are wanted as suspects of murder
According to the police, the people of Northwestern University and the University of Oxford have been searched nationwide, who have become suspects of finding the body of the men who died after the deadly stabbing wounds of a team in Chicago.
According to the Cook County court records, the arrest warrants for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathemi and 56-year Andrew Warreni were released on Monday for the murder of the first degree, due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, 26 years of Cornell-Duranleau died after a repeated stabbing.
According to the warning that the Chicago Police Department issued to the community, a body was found on 27 July.
The police received a phone call and found a victim in the Grand Plaza apartment building for several stab wounds.
According to the officials, the death of Cornell-Duranleau was recognised as murder and investigators were assassinated while the police were actively seeking two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwestern since 2007.
President of the University Public Relations, Alan K. Cubbage, said in a statement sent by e-mail that Lathem has now been temporarily suspended and is forbidden to enter the campus of Northwestern University.
"it is now the case with the competent authorities under investigation and the Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior official at the University of Oxford.
At the University of Somerville College, the representative of the College of Somerville said, "We have been in contact with the police of the British police and ready to help US research facilities in any way possible."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues are in shock and want him to come out.
Mr Anthony Guglielm, Head of Mission of the Chicago Police Department, urges the suspects to surrender himself to the authorities.
"the police have any idea where they are, but we are increasingly working on the exact location," said Guglielm.
According to Guglielm, the suspects are helping to search by local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said the police got a phone call from the Grand Plaza apartment manager who had just received a kryptonite hint that there was something in the apartment.
According to the police, it was a snapshot of the magic.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said security cameras have confirmed the presence of Lathemi and Warren in the building.
"believe that Professor Lathamil and the victim had a relationship," added Guglielm.
The Bank of grand Plaza sent a letter to the citizens: "the police are now working on the chronology of events and the background of the victim's background, and will explore different motives, including the possibility of a family matter."
Idufirms to help your endeavor to avoid the next door to become Ubinger.
Amy Errett wanted to measure employees' satisfaction at the EPC, but the polls were worthless.
The responses were often vague, useless, or worse, even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some staff did not entrust this process.
"this system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who manages the e-commerce business that sells hair maintenance products with 75 employees in San Francisco, Madison Reed.
So he called the foreign parties.
Tärkamas is a new type of start-ups with human resources that help businesses to find out what their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software for the purpose of measuring employee involvement, they will enable companies to make a series of interviews, to target specific teams and demographic groups, to provide anonymity for workers and the hot route of complaints and, in some cases, to allow the authorities to go away from C level leaders and to go directly to the board.
"now there's tools like a Strava and Fitbit designed to monitor health, but where's Fitbit for your company?" Mr Barnett was asked by Mr Barnett, the co-founder and CEO of the Redwood City start-up company Glint, whose software analytic tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
According to Erretti, he has received a much better picture of what his staff will think and feel.
In addition to the pleadings and polls addressed to certain teams, it provides a heating card for the company, which provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which drivers have the lowest support, allowing it to identify the reasons for it.
Companies have begun to understand that they have to stay in touch with their work culture so as not to become the next Ubik, which has been in the scandalous scandals since the former workerpublished a blogging post describing a harassment environment where they were punished for who had the words to take the floor.
For start-ups such as Glint, there is an opportunity for a business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance area may be worth more than USD 118,7 billion in the statistics on the financial transaction statistics on the Let's Talk Payments data by 2020.
In the Denver Colorado market, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, it was observed that this year, in the face of the dubious reputation of Uber, saw an increase in interest and activity.
There are almost 600 clients, including AirbNB, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber checked itself as a client recently.
Like Glinka, it is possible to send a tailor-made impulse survey, collect real-time confidential responses and to look at the problem areas.
It will also provide an anonymous message route allowing employees to know about inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, the complaints will go directly to the Bureau.
"the choice of choice has been given by the regulatory authorities," said the founder of the Converti and the CEO Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that if a company was found to treat their employees poorly or immoral, the company could face serious consequences, such as the boysacks of consumers, the departure of employeesand the cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not interfere.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant, with more than 25 000 employees at 500 sites, has taken over a year of more than one year to ensure the awareness of the rules and procedures of the employees and to provide an easy way of interacting with the corporate headquarters.
If the worker wanted to report the problem before, he had to find a phone number or e-mail address in the corporation, file a formal complaint and expect it to be taken seriously.
This was often discouraging and uncomfortable, said by Ruby's general advisor, James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to follow up on employees' complaints.
However, now that the company is using it centi, there is a possible problem, such as discrimination, harassment or UTPs, which did not come to the leaders who acted in other cities or stateoffices in other cities, to identify and deal more quickly.
"I have a chance to get closer to the Dutch background experience of employees," said Vitrano, who is leading Ruby on the subject of the risk management group.
"and we will protect our shareholders from the courts for legal disputes."
Quinlan said that the companies started to take ethical behaviour, values and involvement of employees more seriously in 2002, even after the audit firm Arthur Andersen failed to meet the Enron scandal as a result of ethical violations.
But only when "social media became mature," businesses understood that they would not be able to prevent their dirty laundry in the public online openly.
"before the use of technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people use the hope of a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Conversely, they provide their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors, who have been there for both start-ups.
In February, it was financed by firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, increasing the capital worth of $47 million.
Glint invested $10 million in the Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments do not come as a surprise to take into account the interconnectedness of enterprises, culture and risk capital.
More and more studies show that modern workers expect more jobs than in the past.
Competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, are high wages and interesting projects merely on the table.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission.
"if people are happy in the company, feel they are being heard and that the work they make is satisfied, they are more of a commitment to the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, who is the vice-president of the department dealing with the general benefits and employees' experience in Linkedlni, using both the Convercenti and the Glinti.
Investors earn revenues when their portfolio companies are well; businesses will be well informed when employees are committed and involved.
In the event of a third party analytic tools to increase the commitment and involvement of employees, it is no wonder that they will be supported.
It is important to have data on the involvement of employees in the work culture, according to experts.
But these data are useless if the company's supervisors don't do anything about them.
In fact, if an entity asks for feedback from its employees, it can generate expectations that changes are expected.
And, if the changes are not rapidly or at all, it can cause frustration and reduce the involvement of employees.
"if you ask 4,000 of the proposal, you have to be prepared for 4,000 interviews," said EDter International President Russell Raath, who has seen how businesses make mistakes to support too much of the collection of data.
"because if things don't end up, employees think," Did you actually hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care? " "
According to Erretti, Mr Reed, who has now organised six studies among employees, has been able to implement the measures on the same day as the problem has been reported through Glink.
And after receiving feedback from employees who have been disappointed in the speed of the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, it was able to restructure several teamsin the company and to provide communication training to deal with problems.
However, it is expected to collect new data on staff, and it is hoped that in the long term it will lead to a longer term commitment industry, known for its great flow of labour.
"if you are not committed to transparency, you lose people," he said, "Vitrano said.
"and if you lose people, you're gonna lose clients.
And if you lose clients, you lose companies. "
The bright star of the Eurozone is the Balticm: incomes are growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and the trade concerns with Russia have had an impact on Balticm, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe, writing Bloomberg by reference to the European Central Bank report.
According to the central bank, since 1999, gross economic output per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
There is a low debt burden behind the success, quickly the institutions and the business-friendly policies that are going to improve.
"the Baltic States in one of Slovakia are among the few countries in the euro area where the real GDP per capita is significantly closer to the EU average," the central bank announced.
While the objective is to make the gross economic output of the human being equated to Western Europe, the total production of the Baltic economies in 2015 was only 2 / 3 15 of the average ofthe population of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement.
The low wages have led to the Baltans to seek better wages from abroad.
While the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light and the economy is growing today, local residents are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the recent Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies have a great deal or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, it felt a little less than half of those surveyed about the economies of its own countries.
NCAA's decision to cancel the trials twice a day makes Bruins' days long
The clock is almost 23 when the trumpet UCLA footballers stop chatting the team at the edge of a new practice field in the campus of campus.
Some of them have hatched off a shirt, exposing their training camp to the first day's efforts on the sweat of the sweat.
For the big part of the team, these gangs will give me the midnight break.
The players participating in the summer courses are headed back to the dorm for the final exam after a three-hour exercise, before returning to the next morning at 6.30 in the Wasserman Football Center.
"the next three days are the real challenge for them," said Bruins Coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to remove the tribes twice daily in order to reduce the burden on the players has, in fact, changed their days in longer - at least until the end of the tests to one side on the Friday.
For this reason, the first three training of UCLA was driven by the beginning of the beginning of 19.15 in order to match the already tight timetable of the players.
The shift from the two traffickers a day means more times in one practice - the start of the Bruins training camp was lifted almost a week in comparison to the previous season, and for the first time in the Mora 6 Westwood season, training courses are carried out during summer courses.
Until the formal preparation for the next meeting in September for Texas A & M is scheduled for September 20.
According to Mora, he is in favour of the NCAA's rulebook, even though it adds another item to the close graphs of the players.
"they have a huge burden on three or four days, and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"and they're going to break themselves through this touch; they're struggling, they're nice young people.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it's really good. "
Once the camp has ended, UCLA's training will be closed down, which is not a simple task, given the clear view of the square of the parking lot and the adjacent Luskin centre, a high-class hotel, which has already been hit by a secure network around the gates of the gate.
Since this weekend, the Bruins have been playing at the hotel, but Mora admitted that there could be problems with the free tobacco during the season.
"implementation security measures," said Mora.
"this is a real concern, and it is not exaggerated at all that people can rent a room and there are training in it.
If you have the recording of the training, it might make a pretty good deal.
But we're gonna use a security team here and in the 8th parking lot.
We will do the best we can use.
I'm trying not to worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place. "
The Savisareater of the island of the Central Bank of Savisareaus, the Government of the Government of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, the European Parliament and the Council, theEuropean Parliament and the Council, the European Parliament, the European Parliament and the Council, the European Parliament and the Council, the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the provisions of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice of the European Union, shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the Court of Justice of the European Union has been appointedby the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.
However, chicks will be counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there are enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who stays with the devil?
When Edgar Savisaare's sponsors have been reduced, the events organised in his election union may not be aided.
One of the members of the State, some of the former and the current cons and many unknown faces, is this such a place to be the composition of the election union?
And whether there is a reason why, in Tallinn, a few Savisaare faithful sympathies and friends, and friends, can be found that the 'Savisaare' list ', at which the corpses of corruption and corruption in corruption are suspected, is becoming a reality?
A video video video video film film on the roof of the city government on the roofing of a Russian popular poem, attended by the senior district of Lasnamäe; and in all respects the original computer game, in which the head of the Prime Minister Jüri Ratas needs to avoid the puzzles and squirrels in the course of the race - is that the first time that the Central party will seek the votes of the 16- and the 17year-olds who are allowed to the ballot boxes for the first time?
We will wait for the party's idea of the youth election campaign.
If Kanal 2 or TV3 will take a black square instead of the beginning of August, there will be two options: to accept that in the future there will be only ETV, ETV2, ETV +, Tallinn TV and English-English France24, or transfer to a ten-month television operator every month.
It is probably also the one who first welcomes the television experience publicly available, but at last, even though it is reluctant to pay for television print and advertisements.
Depressing music, noisy people, and the scum of the streets of the streets, are the most unpleasant side of any major music festival.
However, if you don't want to be part of the makeup, it's worth getting home to discover the homeland instead of hurting your head, and leave the bedroom for the amount of the paddy for the festival dependants.
Washington is changing the rules of the green card.
According to MEPs, President Donald Trump, who said that the new US Immigration plan, which changes the rules of the Green Card, will be proposed.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family orientation visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republican and the President supports them.
There's a conspiracy to discuss the congressional section of the congressional section.
This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, as it will change the way to the citizens of other countries of the United States.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process confers an advantage on candidates who speak English and who have the financial means to support themselves and the skills that come to our economy, "said Trump, according to US media outlets.
Young people of Siberia are moving to the city, pensioners returning to the land.
Jevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous seto gold diggers in the old Maana river.
He employs 140 km away from home to Maana's tributary as a culinary brick.
It's a tough job for, like, 12 hours of work for two months, and then only ten days at home and back again.
In the past three years, Anatoli has only seen the gold one time.
"there is a hard time: in a way in which it is carried out," it will not lead to the vodka and go out ,"" he speaks with Anatoli.
Mare Piho had a conversation with the local seto Jaani in the village of Haiti, who has told him a lot about his family's memories in Siberia.
The archaic culture still preserved in Siberian sexes will also affect home-seabs, as it is just so amazing, the more extensive walls are looking into the Piho Mare.
From his first trip to Siberia, this year is 30 years.
In that time, he's been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many were traveled out in Siberia at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century to get the land?
This is an unresolved issue.
I'm saying 8,000.
I've taken it out of Siberian seto for men who have thought of it.
It is hard to say, 'cause then there could be 30 people in one group, but the passport was given only to a man.
The passport was only granted to one, but he had children, nurses, etc.
Look at the size of that territory here!
It was a number of times a lot of historical Setomaas many times.
There was a need to be educated, to be managed in a way.
Setos came here as peasants, but the change of their lives, because here they ended up in areas not only related to agriculture, but also in the river (baffling), gold mines, industry.
For example, many of the setod later went to work with the classified town Krasnoyarsk-45 (there built a Soviet power plant for the uranium enrichment plant - J. P.), when it was set up.
Did the setod represent most of the population in the region in the region?
Yes, they lived compact.
In addition, there was a long tradition of getting married and a lot of children.
Seven eight children in the family were common.
How much is the Siberian setode culture different from that of the mother's setode?
They're different, even though what was brought here was never the same.
They brought a lot of people's ideas.
They did it himself, but they always made a difference that was brought together, and what was done here.
Climate change was heavily influenced by the traditional clothing of setode because it is colder here.
The food has changed.
Like Setomaal's meat salted, but it just froze here.
Where are the villages of Siberia and what lives will live there? / graphics: Alari Palace
The link with the mother was mentally strong, and it was considered to be of great importance.
It seems to me that it is now starting to give the Setumaa back there, starting to affect them.
Those girls who have lived in this family have listened to amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of a delegation from Estonia who came to the day of July to visit the Kingdom of Seto to visit the Kingdom of Seto and lived in the home four days in the homes of J.P.
What's left here is amazing.
"killing is easy to come and go," because the city has a great location: in a railway course and a crossroads at the crossroads ," says the Uperisolist Reigo Tamm from Kill.
The city is not just a military capital for a long time, we have a lot of creativity, sports and cultural places, and there is a stamp on each corner.
Kill is the top top of the city!
There is a small island in the city over from the city through the White River, where the Tapals tend to have a hunting party.
"it doesn't appear in the front of the train from the beautiful place," Reigo.
Who is not afraid of cold water can swim in the river, because the river is full of sources.
I've been swimming in there. I'm gonna be all right!
The sister's water can be considered a picnic and simply romantically involved - can face the flow of the river and think in front of life.
I've been walking out there with my girlfriends.
Tamm, Ooperisold Tamm, has been under the influence of the three bridges between the three bridges to practice: 'that this place is by the city, no one may be in charge as a humble of his stories.'
There is a wonderful view of the game of the game, but there are also health professionals, where you can run, to ski, and now, for example, to play discgolf - the golf course is done, and the disks can be rented out by the Sports Centre ', leading to Reigo.
The old pros, of course, go with their showers, but I haven't even played it yet.
Apparently, my colleague, Rasmus Kull, to invite Tapale to the village, 'cause he's an experienced discologist, and he's got the disks.
He's gonna lend me some money!
The Reigo and the Game Mountain were inseparable from the days of their childhood.
At least during the skiing hours.
There are many tears in this mountain, a disappointment, and you may be in my sport.
Without talking about broken clocks and skis.
"the whole town is filled with construction works now, all of this becomes beyond recognition," praises Reigo.
However, the old and tired housing building is a very attractive place to be played by summer sentences.
I am pleased that the leader of the R.A.A.A., the leader of the R.A.A.A., adopted my idea, and came to the post of a summer theatre with his theater.
However, the season's season with the "Alekle Karenin" season has just been completed, on 11 August at the railway station on "Elluawakening," when the old fox building moves around the age of 1980.
"from 11 to 13 August, Tapa is the day of the city, which has also developed an open home cafeteria, and there is a series of cultural events, including crowds," Reigo, who suggests visitingthe city on a noil day in 91 years.
In a small yellow house on 1 May, the museum has been a museum since 1994.
"the house is small, but the exhibits are well enough, and there is a lot of information," praises the Reigo, which is filled with the history of the Tapa City, the greater of which focuses on the railways and the wars.
Reigo mumps, if Kill all the recommended places go through, the stomach goes on a long, but luckily, a small town is full of coffee.
"we have such good dinners, and sometimes when we sit in the cafeteria, sometimes it feels like you're abroad." he's describing.
The soldiers who have been educated and young Kill will spend a lot of time in the cardboard cafeteria, and that's where it feels like you're in Estonia and in your hometown, but there's suchan international community together.
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories about the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we're going through a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tending in Greece
A television channel was quoted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tending in Greece.
The police arrested the group of people illegally in the Sithonia Peninsula on 1 August, including two Bulgarians.
They shot off the same day, but there's an investigation going on now.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said bTV on the television channel that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on the free camping process and already put in place fines for all those who will be caught in a safe place in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The wolves are teaching the wolves to break sheep.
Hiyland farmers will have to give the wolves to "educational material" after a year, apparently the wolves have already broken a lot of sheep.
Now the wolves have broken sheep in Hiiu County three times, totalling 23 sheep and an injury is eight, writing Hiiu Leht.
The corresponding number was only three, the year earlier, 124.
In the synchronised of the Murders, there is also the data of the Environmental Agency that the soil of Hiiumaa has not been born and led by the Hiyland and Hindu Council information that thisyear, on the island, will have a fixed number of two wolf pests on the island.
On the night of the night, the wolves broke out from 15 sheep in the village of the Kabuna and injured half of the surviving sheep.
In the early morning of Wednesday, the wolves broke down a sheep in the Reheunk Village and severely damaged the other who had to be killed.
The rules for the treatment of genetically modified crops must be clear:
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the introduction of the genetically modified organisms on the environment (GMOs) and the Act on the amendment of the plant protection law.
The amendment of the Act will waive the creation of a separate data collection for both the introduction of genetically modified crops and the creation of a separate data collection for handlers, for this purpose the plant health register will be used.
In addition, GM crop premium is subject to a prior agreement with the target group dealing with beekeeping.
While GM crops are currently not cultivated in Estonia, there is a need for clear rules for coexistence of genetically modified crops.
This is at least until it is decided to declare Estonia 's GMO free', 'the plant health department in the Ministry of the World Health Department Sigmar Suu Kyi said.
"in the same vein, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens associated with both the private and the public sector," and added its mouthpiece.
The draft law repeal the provisions relating to the data collection and management training of GM crop facilities and handlers, lays down requirements for the treatment of GM crops and for starting economic activities.
In specific terms, the farmer's obligation to inform the beekeeping of the cultivation of GM crop in GM crops is replaced by an obligation to achieve an appropriate agreement with the mesiniumbefore starting to grow.
The draft law has been sent to ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have an opportunity to know about the draft information system and, if they so wish, give their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
Planned changes affect particularly those active in the field of plant production, beekeepers and farming.
Only one GM crop is permitted to grow in the European Union, including Estonia, on maize MON 810.
However, there is still no interest in the cultivation of GM crops that have been of interest to the farmers in Estonia.
The reasons for this reason are the fact that there are no maize pests in Estonia, a European reserve, which is resistant to maize MON 810.
There are also the varieties of maize in the southern regions and this is not suitable for our climatic conditions in May.
In order to obtain assurance, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has ordered research in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible GM seeds, maize and soy varieties, in Estonia, for the detection of pollution by potential GM organisms.
The results of the sampled samples showed that the seeds did not contain the seeds and the study concluded that the seeds of oilseed rape, maize and soy varieties in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that there is no deliberate cultivation of GM crops in Estonia and there has also been a confirmation that no accidental contamination has taken place.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United in the state of Nemanja Maticu says "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has painted the "geniuses" in Nemanja Maticu, after the central player Sampdoria accepted his debut on Wednesday night.

Another desire was on foot by the GSM transmitter on August 1, and once again for Muhus.
The first courier of the Speaker Mati Martinson was the first courier, and the litter of this place has been moved around, has departed from the launches and joined the Snowy size of a large overnight stay.

British inventor had to install a microchip in his body to get into the house and get in the car.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to install a microchip so that he could only open his front door, get into the office and even start a car.
33 years old Steven Northam allowed a small chip to be fitted between his thumb and the name finger, and now provides this service through its own company BioTeq to businesses and individualswishing to make it easier for technology to do so.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson in Winchester County, Hampshire County, New York City Hospital, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to those of a microchip in cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company changes houses and cars' locks so that they can match the chip, asking for a single lock for 300 pounds.
This married child's father has installed technology both home and in his car BMW Z4, which will start if his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exponate cost taxpayers thousands.
According to the military documents released to the press, the White House's decision to fly the Navy's helicopter last month to the southern court for the event of American production cost taxpayers $24,000.
The Green and White Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the Marine One as the President, was the central attraction of an event giving rise to American construction programmes that took place in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and the White House senior officials update industrial products from all 50 states.
A helicopter built on Connecticut was exponentially taken from the Maine source, Wisconsin, a firecar and a fork factory in Mississippi.
According to the reports of the Ship Accident Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) documents, the White House Warden called a helicopter presence with the FARGOI almost 36 hours before thehelicopter "unusual" for the "unusual" event in the south yard.
"I wanted you to be aware of this, as it is not usually the event of a great focus," said the day before the day of the day before the event in the eletter of an e-mail to his superior, to thedeputy commander of the Navy, in the field of aviation.
It was marked that the helicopter arrives at the southern court at around 7 p.m. in the morning at 7:00 in the morning and remain there until the yard cleared the same night between 18 and 21.
In addition, the fact that, if leaving the White House is to be left, there is a need for a second ekipathy for reasons of working time limitations.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the arc security team remained near the aircraft over the rest of the year.
It was not possible to figure out whether any other ekipathy ended in the end or not.
The Hatchi Act prohibits the federal agents from exercising their government's assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event could violate this provision.
"and we were told that it would violate Hatch's law, and we were told not to ruin," wrote the Commander.
"it seems you don't have a choice," he said, "the deputy of the leading officer."
The White House declared the event "in America" for the official event and the Hatch law would not have covered it.
But even on official events, there are political bodies.
The President expressed his support for the health reform process at the time of the Senate debate and praised efforts to keep government regulations in danger.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for a politically profitable purpose is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use these purely photovoltaic is unusual.
The trump came to notice in February when his first campaign event in Florida, Florida, went into a water background with the President's plane, and his Twitter account is crawling with messages that will complain about how his predecessor's president is using the plane.
"the White House is very happy" in the United States of America, where the product was represented in all 50 states prepared by American workers, "said by the White House press representativeLindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 teams are often in the vicinity of Washington and in the southern yard, to practice with the President of the United States, to practice the building on the white house with a centimetre of centimetre.
As Trump at the beginning of July in Germany at the G20 summit, HMX-1 held 58 samples of the White House yard.
According to the official, the flight to the "American" flight crew was included in the standard of the monthly flight team of the flight crew.
Esframe's helicopters were flying for another 11 hours on the same day for "non-president support missions."
According to the White House, none of the other causes of this event were burdened with the taxpayer's wallet.
According to Sikorsky, the company was not involved in the organisation of the helicopter in the south of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not preserve the budgetary documents of the President's flight records and the exact costs of the event are difficult to find out.
However, according to the hourly hourly rates of the Ministry of Defence in 2017, the VH-3D will be a compensation rate of 24 380 dollars per hour.
In the Esframe's documents, a flight was given to an average of its basic base from the Navy Quantico from Virginia in both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is much less than that.
"the calculation of the costs of tax payers on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading," said Ms Walters.
"these estimates shall include human resources, maintenance and much other undisclosed expenditure, which shall be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the RAC survey of 2015, the Department of Defense has no compensation rates for staff costs, but this will cover the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracts.
The former spokesperson for the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the event at the time of the helicopter.
"the idea of things is to show things in America this week," said Spicer.
"and I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they will contribute to our national security and that there is expected to be hundreds, if not even thousands of people who depend on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and the other military equipment on which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
So, of course, it's right to raise it. "
It is not clear whether Trump was touched by a helicopter or not, but he was sitting behind the wheel of a fire car.
In the White House, Trump turned over to Sikorsky's agents, making jokes about company products in his personal aircraft park.
"I know Sikora well," said the President, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - through the tears of peace and joy
The 2011 Mining Daegus has hit the Šadeiko in the last area, 800 m on the run and the stadium was taken with a pier with a stretcher.
Shortly before that, he had become a distance of zero in the history of the universe in China.
In 2009, the winner of the Helsinki European Economic and Social Committee (EMD), the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, the European Parliament and the Council, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union and of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union andof the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union and of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union of the European Union
Bad luck, after all.
During the opening day, in the country of Moscow, during the opening day, Estonia has succeeded as a leader in a leader from a leader away from his thumbprint injury.
Two years later, he received 15 places in Beijing and filled the Olympics, but that was more of a disappointment to the athlete.
The heavyweight of the most difficult chapel was only in the soil when it did not get the result of the Amsterdam at the start of a distance.
I'd just like to put a real multicontest once in a while.
"once again," sprayed Šadeiko.
The worst was ahead: the month later, his Olympic event in Rio was already the first barrier in Rio.
The time has come for me to pick up - will the seven-match go on?
Is it worth all that for two days?
She meant for a while, but she found her peace.
I've got to clear my head
It's kind of hard to describe this experience, but I've been thinking that last season and Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Lucky it was time to heal itself and think about it.
"I knew I'd never put a bag in my bag," said Šadeiko's self-destruct.
I got rid of the clean sheet and move on with the new one.
Coach Anne Mountain said it was very difficult to look at the careless suffering, but he understood that, above all, the athlete had to get out of his own.
I mean, she was so jumbled all over her.
It was hard to take.
"Grit said he wouldn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth," he says Mountain.
Now he's got some kind of peace.
He's doing it for her pleasure.
The winner came back in May, when Šadeiko erected a new Estonian record of 6280.
At a high level of competition, he repaired his own top of the top baker with nearly a meter (13.89) and ran away from a record close to the time of the record.
Then the multicontestant felt that it wasn't even a chance at all, but it was only wiped out only the first day of competition.
For years, he said that Šadeiko is a musterary student.
He's ready to be an athlete. he's good to train.
If anything goes wrong or it's wrong, he'll say it now.
He knows his body and trusts his sense of recognition.
That's what we need to do.
I can't tell you what to do exactly and follow it.
The new approach has also been found in Šadeiko.
"I am not the one who makes the most of the practice," he tells me and he says the most important thing is the receipt of the right recognition, because it also ensures good results.

Poor emotions have provided with Šadeiko as well as the best of luck.
So his former training companion in Maris Mountain as Sister Grete recently became parents, and several contestants have received support from these new citizens.
"it's been an interesting thing," said Šadeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking equals "training."
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that believes - with wine, you can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist in Yale University.
Her message is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but it is "very active" in the taste of the wine.
By smelling the glass, with the suction of the wine in the mouth, in its enjoyment and in the sense of the aftertaste, we will put our brain to work in order to create a flavour for wine.
According to Sheperdi, the presence of bovine animals does not actually contain flavours, but a taste in the way the wine is stimulated by the brain.
He's bringing about how the brain "sees" color.
"Earth is not in wine, taste the taste of the wine," says Sheperd.
Things that affect the taste of the taste of the wine are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of spit that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, guesses the wine is not to drink itself.
"there needs to be more," he says.
If you get too big a drink, the system is saturated.
Excessive consumption of wine may harm the brain instead of taking advantage, according to the 2004 survey, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, loss of memory, loss of equilibrium and reduced mental capacity.

From the Philippines to the heart of a wide world, maybe a beer bag trip to the heart of the motorcycle.
The crawled bags are a summer classic, which has become a hit product in the last few years, one of the right stockpiles, which has to hang out of hand, and which has been the subject of a price image of the hive, despite its modest origin.
A bag in the shoulders is probably one of those things that have been there once in a lifetime, which has not created a special emotion.
It just exists, and if there isn't, there's nothing broken.
However, the shoulder bags are now in a real race, and the mosquitoes have changed their fancy designer bags for summer months against a simple straw against red bags.
This is not just a coastline at all, but today it is also popular as a street bag and that the bravest women even walk into the office.
However, it is worthwhile, however, to make it clear whether the suvine look at the top of the suvine still sits or is still paying attention to a little more in the official direction of thenotebook and laptop.
The brightness of the upper hand has made women the true summer love.
For example, when you read foreign moebens, then the first thing is that the moegums are the first to get the holiday trip to the local market and acquire a few beers, to which the rest of therest of the holiday, and what goes along the beach, on the market, as well as with my girlfriends hanging out on the town.
Some bloggers are so generous, buy a lot more than they sell bags from the market and sell or give them to their loyal readers.
In this context, it is worth noting that there is a huge demand for the bags among readers that women (and men) would go in the real world. Apparently, an assault on each other to get a couple of bags to be happy.
In some ways, this madness is understandable, because they are rare when they have the chance to buy just a few euros for a few of the euro.
True, clever merchants have also found a simple currency of money and thus sell the brushes of luxury brands for some time and EUR 1000.
Apparently, the richer clients shouldn't be feeling elegant as a simple mortal, who make a circle with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy the Dolce & Gabbana for over a thousand euros.
However, an interpretation of Chanel's shoulders of beer can go out in a circle of EUR 6000.
Unlike most of the mobuildings, the shoulder bags, however, do not at least have a very large fashion show, but their story originated on a more distant basis.
In fact, the shoulder bags are reportedly far from the Philippines, from which they are very broad.
In particular, there is a lot of misconceptions that are often carried out in the area of the exporting business and the local authorities are very often not familiar with them.
It is estimated to be from the 14th century of the iceberg technique and is quite a series of conventional wrinklers.
However, since a beer bag is not nearly as large as a basket, they can be blamed for the muscles and other materials that make the bag more personal and more actrable.
For example, in the last few hours, particularly trendy bags of red ribbons or leather straps are in place.
In this letter, the shoulder bags may, above all, send an actress to Jane Birkin, most of whom were never seen before.
Specifically, he suited his shoulder bag to all possible garment kits and did not have much to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
However, the popularity of the eagles today does not play a smaller role, but also that caring for them is a rooster and, unlike all other sumadan, they do not need to be cared for, but alsoabout water and wet towel.
As in the case of trendy robbers, the brand of the brands has come out with all possible interpretations.
For example, in the case of a wish, you may be acquired by a blended blender or a tiny bag of oil.
However, it is worth keeping in mind that a classic shoulder bag will never go out of fashion, on the shoulder of the shoulder.
But what's a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, the classic cold-rolled bag, which reminds me of its style in the basket, is open and short as well as the shoulders and the shoulders.

GMB is worried about the investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The trade union looks forward to a long-term plan of production plans in the company's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent on the future of an investment in Tollcrosses.
More than 500 people are employed in a factory producing Hobnobyl and Rich Tea.
The owner of the Company McVitie said that they had invested more than 5 million pounds in the last couple of years of the facility.
There were a number of employees in the company and the union presidents "are the first to hear" if anything changes in the work of the plant.
In a letter sent to the company's leader, the GMB sent back to Scotland company McVitie's request "defaulting concerns about the fact that the financing was not used to modernise production lines."
GMB Senior Chief Officer Drew Duffy said: 'the fact that we do not get clarity about Tollcrosses' business needs and the future investment plan for Tollcrosses makes our members deeply concerned.
Several generations of families have worked here and labour force is largely made up of the local community and the people of the Glasgow neighbourhood, being an indispensable pillar of ensuring decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social exclusion.
Thus, in the face of the jobs, pay and welfare of the eastern part of Glasgow, and in the face of Brexit, the rise in the costs of living and the chronic decline in production, it is badly needed to make a high-performance undertaking in McVitie. "
The Plaintiff spokesperson said, "The leader of Tollcrosses received a letter from GMB Scotlan only yesterday and the company will respond directly because we value active communication withemployees' and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between the staff of Tollcrossis and the representatives of the GMB, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
We were discussing with the workers that, like all other companies in extremely competitive and fragile economies, we are reviewing our activities on the run - and this applies to all our companies and objects - to ensure their competitiveness.
He added: "in recent years, we have invested over the subject of Tollcrosses over 5 million pounds, most of it has gone into production lines and the improvement of operations.
We are to understand the legacy of Tollcrosses as a productive object and, if there are any changes in the activity of an item, the employees and the representatives of the trade union are the first to hear it. "
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about their convergence?
La Liga may regret its interest against Marco Verwheel
Paris Saint-Germain will not be able to lure Neymar into their ranks, making him a bid of 189 million pounds to avoid him. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago for that record raid?
This decay approach has opened the summer shift window and the Ligue 1 Club is ready to crush more than twice the current world record of the overpurchase, which was erected in the previous season with Paul Pogba coming back to Manchester Union for a pound of GBP 89 million.
After the transition has been completed, Neymarist will result in the world's most expensive player as well as the highest paid professional athlete in the world who will receive over 500 000pounds per week after the payment from the PSGC.
Barcelona is also angry with both the approach of convergence and the release of Neymar, although a close source of the Catalans to the board confirms that the club has always carried the bestcare since its arrival at Santobecause of Santost since his arrival in Santote.
But did the president of the PSG warn the football world for this opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed an interest in the award of a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Alkesh warned the Alkesh of Alkesh severely in all clubs, who think of the recruitment ofsome BSG best players.
"I do not worry, because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will confront them and contact their players," said Al-Khelaif.
"we respect all clubs.
But if they try to make a contract with some of our players, they'll have to face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have taken over this border since the Spanish Club showed an interest in the PSG central player Marco Verwheel earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that they would not be allowed to leave an Italian state under any circumstances, and that Barcelona could lose its interest as a result of its interest, by losing out of its expensive assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexitis.
"Brex is seriously threatened with a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," he warned Northern Ireland in the first visit to Northern Ireland on the first visit in June.
"I can't imagine who would use it," she added.
Infrastructure projects across borders made possible the free movement of people and goods, said Varadkar.
"this is our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders," he stressed.
According to Varadents, it would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and that it failed to become a part of the common European market.
It would maintain current free trade between the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom.
The second chance of making British exit more smoothly would be the establishment of a European Union and the UK Customs Union, explaining the Irish Prime Minister.
To note that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said, "I would certainly like to have such Britain."
The alternative would be to return to the customs points, which would constitute a historical division and political failure.
"the truth of trade, prosperity and peace," the Irish Prime Minister said.
He named Brexiet as "the challenge of our generation" and warned that this result could affect every aspect of the daily life of Northern Ireland.
In Belfast, the Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main political parties in Northern Ireland.
