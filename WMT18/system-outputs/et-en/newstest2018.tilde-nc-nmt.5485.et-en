Four members of the Kemerovo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimees, police in Spain detained the head of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underworld, Slava Gulevitch, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevitch, detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects detained in Estonia into custody.
According to the suspicion, it is members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal association, aged between 27 and 57, who mainly commit drug crimes.
An alleged head of a criminal association was detained in the Malaga province of Spain in Miami.
In Estonia, three men were detained as suspects, one of them being the leading figure of a criminal association according to the data collected, and two are members of a criminal association.
The data collected indicates that the criminal organisation had clearly allocated tasks and roles.
The purpose of the criminal association's activities was to commit drug crimes and thereby generate criminal proceeds," commented the head of the criminal case's pre-trial proceedings, Public Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out an increase in the circle of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have also been previously in the interest of law enforcement agencies, and some of them have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become customary for us, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," commented prosecutor Verte.
Head of the Central Criminal Police Service Ago Leis said the detentions were preceded by a preliminary investigation lasting nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work materialized and we simultaneously detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that central criminal police officials were instrumental in the detention in Spain.
For years now, we have good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These detentions are another message for criminals that we can also get them from another end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that, while on the loose, suspected men may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the Prosecutor's Office requested their arrest and was also approved by the court.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting his surrender to Estonia.
Real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized in the framework of this criminal case to ensure confiscation.
Pre-trial criminal proceedings shall be conducted by the Central Criminal Police Office for organised crimes and led by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevitch in 2005 of extortion and sentenced him to five years imprisonment.
In the middle of the previous decade, after Nikolai Tarankov, the underworld leader at the time, Gulevitch was considered to be the second most important man in Estonia's criminal world.
Gulevitch, from kemerovo, rose to prominence in Estonia's underworld in the early 1990 s when he began to deal with extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes who operated at various hotels and demanded a monthly roof tax from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal proceeds and court rulings that have entered into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest judgments, the eight indictees from the criminal case of the so-called Dikajevi criminal association confiscated criminal proceeds of €80,000, or the verdict against nine persons in that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association in 2006 aimed at illegal trade in secret cigarettes and committing crimes related to trafficking in human beings in Ida-Virumaa and South Estonia.
The amount of criminal proceeds confiscated there is close to EUR 71 500.
In these criminal cases, success has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day and that, if necessary, operations are carried out together in any country in the European Union.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri against the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement states: "The NAACP travel note issued for the state of Missouri, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-American passengers, visitors and missourians to be particularly attentive and supremely cautious in moving around the state, given the whole range of suspicious race-based events that have recently occurred across the state and are also outlined here."
According to the NAACP, the group urged the travel warning to be issued by both the recent Missouri law, which makes it harder to win lawsuits on discrimination, and the fact that the state's law enforcement targets are incomparably largely minorities.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are drawn to the roadside because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "NAACP Missouri branch president Rod Chapel told the newspaper The Kansas City Star.
"We have never received such close complaints before."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization for the US state.
The group referred to such events as racist insults at the direction of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances at the start of this year after he ran out of gas while driving through the state and Missouri police took him into custody without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the remark refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that in the state, black-car drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped than white-collar drivers.
"The remark is meant to make people aware and to warn their families, friends and work colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared, whether it means taking the bail money or notifying relatives that they're going through the state."
Based on the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, placing the state 16 th in the state's cross-sectional ranks in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also in response to a new law in Missouri that makes it difficult for a company to sue for discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU had issued earlier travel remarks about Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because, according to the ACLU, it increases racial profiling.
Typically, the Department of Foreign Affairs issues travel warnings about other countries, but lately interest groups have begun to use this measure as a counterreaction to certain U.S. laws and trends.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about the different forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, may be caused by five different hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C, which may develop into cirrhosis of the liver, or wrinkles of the liver and liver cancer, are at a low cost.
Health Board epidemiology adviser Kuulo Kutsar says the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, greyish stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last sign of disease also comes from the follicular name of inflammation of the liver, jaundice.
In children, hepatitis can run without signs of disease.
Different types of liver inflammation can only be determined based on laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can be transitioned to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without symptoms, meaning a person may know nothing about their dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Kuulo Kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their course more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, from the faeces of an infected person to the hands and hands of food, surfaces, objects, getting into the mouth and consuming drugs.
The risk or risk group for hepatitis A includes family members and caregivers of the affected person, people suffering from chronic liver disease, people having sex with the infected person, men having sex with the men, drug addicts, passengers visiting countries with high hepatitis A spread.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular vaccination is recommended for people travelling a lot and at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to comply with daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruit and vegetables before food is consumed.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread by contact with the blood of a sick person, by injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using blood-contaminated household items (toothbrushes, shaving devices), by using donor blood, by having sex with a person suspected of hepatitis, and from the mother of hepatitis to the foetus/newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and passengers visiting countries with high hepatitis B disease.
People can be vaccinated to prevent hepatitis B; in particular people at risk and people suffering from chronic liver diseases, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes mellitus are encouraged to be vaccinated.
Other prevention measures for hepatitis B include: prevention of the use of foreign hygiene and manicures, other sharp devices and needles for syringes, tattooing and piercing, and use of condoms in the event of harmful sex or prevention of sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan in Estonia and free for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread by contact with the blood of a sick person, by injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using blood-contaminated household items, having sex with a donor blood, having sex with a person suspected of hepatitis, and from the mother of a hepatitis patient to the foetus/newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, blood and other bodily fluids in contact with health, rescue workers and police officers, persons with HIV infection and passengers visiting countries with high hepatitis C disease.
Hepatitis C prevention measures include: prevention of the use of foreign hygiene and manicures, other sharps and needles for syringes, tattooing and piercing, and use of condoms in the event of harmful sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which multiplies in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses come into contact with blood and other bodily fluids, with contaminated needles, sexually transmitted and infrequently infected mothers to the foetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have hepatitis B immunity.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with a hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people against infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses are spread by faecal oral route with drinking water and food, including low heat-treated beef, fish and shellfish, donor blood, shared syringes and infected mother to the foetus.
Passengers may be infected in high-risk countries with hepatitis E.
The prevention measures for hepatitis E are to meet hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after taking care of the sick.
Wash fruit and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating little heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and refrain from consuming drugs.
Although at the last round the competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic winner off the track, the 34-year-old Farah found strength at the end and won with a time of 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, taking Tania and the children along the path after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told journalists.
Farah is aiming for the fifth title race in London in a row with a 5,000 and 10,000 metre run gold duopoly.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Dam in gold. The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer" dives far deeper into the cultural life of the late 19 th century and early 20 th century Vienna.
But even more thoroughly into history.
An awe-inspiring piece of information might have been worn out by a harder curveball, a narrower subject for the extraordinary story of the portrait allowed in the title.
There are now two books between the covers: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer on Gustav Klimt and her painting "Lady in gold," and a much larger and more comprehensive history book about the esteemed Jewish families and the German occupation with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to a cultural life in the middle of Vienna, and who is himself in the capital of Austria, can hardly imagine how life went around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone turned their heads in the Central Cafe when Klimt came in.
The concentration of cultural characters was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and when you see a familiar name in the book, you feel like a gram more culturally.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where there was an incurable syphilis and the highest level of suicide in Europe does not add much to the story's development.
Or, perhaps, every pair of brushes adds colour to the cultural life of the early 20 th century in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19 th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, nearly every tenth resident of Vienna was a Jew.
Adele's parents were newcomers in Vienna, too, but by the time Adele married her twice-opened Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and posed for Klimt for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh-largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
However, Adelet's entire glamorous life, where she belonged, wasn't drawn.
When you look at "Dam in gold," it's hard to believe that at the end of life this great lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of her husband from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt's order cost 4,000 kronor at the time, a quarter of the price of a land house with a good location.
The fact that some portraits suspected the master's love affair with the model did not discourage the sugar magnate.
As for Adeles, the only definite fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist during the work continued for the rest of his life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "The lady in gold.
The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer," Varrak 2016, English translated by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before the start of his work with Adele, Klimt had been to Ravenna San Vitale in basil, and investigators think that the brilliant mosaics that had just been seen there from Empress Theodora gave the artist the idea of making a gold portrait of Adele as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Dam in gold" in Vienna in 1908 and at about the same time (from 1907 to 1908) another golden painting was born "The kiss."
Art historians did not notice the resemblance between the two women.
What does Hitler have to do with the story?
"I think, in memory of my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his handiwork available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wished their family's Klimt collection would go to the museum.
Six years before he died, Klimt had a second portrait of Adele.
Also in her will (Adele left in February 1925), she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscape paintings to the Austrian Gallery.
She left her jewelry to her nieces Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had finished "The Mona Lisa of Austria," 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to get into the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, but failed at the drawing exam.
Although sometimes the cause of Hitler's later anti-Semitism is considered not to have been accepted by Jewish professors into academia, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the function of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in Maria's will, had changed considerably by 1939; it had become important to find the works of the Nazi Party in the rich Jewish arts of Vienna.
Some of Adele's work at home, but not Klimt's, was also suitable for Hitler's personal art property.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year litigation between the Austrian government and the heirs of Bloch-Bauers began.
At this point, it should be noted that when the "kiss" is seen in Vienna at Belvedere Castle, the "lady's gold" depicting Adele Bloch-Bauer is to be seen in New York's Neue Gallery.
And before going to Vienna, read the above book.
Even if you don't plan on going to see Klimt's work, because at least my emotions swirled more Nazi and Jewish after the book was closed than the $135 million painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much a portrait, but rather a story of the family's fate - and a very moving story.
The Bauers' family tree at the beginning of the book made it considerably easier to orient yourself in events.
17-year-old swimmer was very close to Estonian record in Canada
In pre-swim, Gold's own 200 m supine swimming personal record was very close to swimming at 2.16.62.
The top brand comes from a 17-year peak a week ago, when the Canadian Junior Championships turned 2.16.58, mediating Priit Aavik's Swimming blog.
Gold was the last to reach the A-final, perhaps the tenth.
In the final, he took a distance of 2.15.76 and gained a good seventh place with a powerful new top.
Of the Estonian record owned by Alina Kendzier (2.15.13), Gold remained subtracted for a little over half a second.
In Estonia's all-time success table, Gold rose to third, and his fresh personal top brand is the fifth result of all times in Estonia.
The young hope of the future is yet to launch at the Canadian Adult Championships in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestanding and 200 m - and 400 m complex.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships took place in Toronto, and Gold also made successful launches there.
He won the 200 m freestyle silver medal with a time of 2.03.22.
So quickly this distance was swamped by the guardian last time in 2008.
Ever faster than Gold, only the Estonian record woman, Elina Partõka, has swam this distance in Estonia.
The Estonian woman living in Canada won another bronze medal in the 100 m freestyle with an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season with a top stamp of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than her, has been swimming this distance only one hundredth faster.
He reached his personal peak at 100 m on his back swimming, and received a letter of 1.03.69 in the opening exchange of the announcement.
At half-time distance, he only achieved seventh place when swimming in the final at 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season's success table at four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen teeth
The time for vacations is on - it also means relaxing to US President Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has so far been one of the most vacation days taken out by the president, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president's plan is to spend a 17-day vacation at his namesake golf club in Bedminster, which is based in New Jersey.
Although the president's vacation began yesterday, Trump's opponents have been speaking for a week on the subject of the vacation.
They are pitching Trump for too frequent a rest.
It is the president's practice to spend the weekend in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villas.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days of office.
George W. Bush, for example, had already reached 67 days on vacation in that time, while Barack Obama was half less than Trump, just 21 days.
However, Trump tends to forget things quickly.
Days after becoming president, Trump said on the show "60 Minutes" that there would be no time for long vacations during his term, because very much needed to be done.
He also expressed resentment three years ago over Barack Obama's vacation.
The current president then wrote on Twitter: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is cutting off journalists' heads."
According to White House officials, a 17-day golf club visit is hardly a relaxation.
It's officially called a working vacation, during which time Trump doesn't have time to read or other celestial activities.
In addition, there must have been another reason for work leave.
Namely, the air conditioning system in the west wing of the White House is being replaced and therefore all personnel had to leave it.
The Oval Office and other presidential premises are also located in the west wing.
"I don't think any of you would want to be in the west wing in August when there's 38 degrees and no air conditioning," said White House spokesman Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue to work during the vacation.
From where President Trump will spend the next 17 days, you'll get an idea of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook  don't run for state office unless you tolerate voter criticism
Our country's father knew a lot about unfavourable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to bully him for everything from internal politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn't force his critics to remain silent.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of speech may be taken away from us, and in silence, we may be led to sheep-like slaughter."
This brings me to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who needs to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And toward the start of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU sued him for that reason.
The governor's office stamped the action null and void, and the online comments were full of counter-reactions in the style of "Who cares?."
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But it does matter.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
It's an astonishingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His approval percentage is second-best among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan is not an unthinking reactionary moocher.
He has led the state with a firm hand and remained strictly determined by his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as a key tool in communicating with his constituents, presenting his bald head cheerfully for the first time after chemotherapy, for example.
Thus, the Governor's page  which is a public forum with official markings, managed by staff getting paid out of taxpayers' dollars  is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's conduct in an interview given to The Washington Post, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing but moderation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture online of grueling online trolls, spammers, or people full of anger.
The Post had a conversation with several real people that Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they are -- real people who communicate with their elected leaders -- teacher, company owner and pastor, not online trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not foul at all.
The pastor cited the Bible in his post, oppressing Hogan's Catholicism.
The lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, from Maryland Bowie, did not incite anger but real anger about the crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed as he has not responded to anger crimes or other recent news," he wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.
"Nor do I like the idea that when many people comment on the same subject, some immediately call it an indifferent collective effort, instead of acknowledging that it is a large number of concerned citizens."
In what the governor's office called a "targeted spam attack," others would probably call "public support."
The Facebook-era allows messages to be easily matched by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the old days, when to do the same, workers had to be sent out to gather up newspapers with critical lead letters and burn them or arrest the protestors and force them to remain silent.
But that's exactly what's going on right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official to be criticized for making Facebook and other social media toothless.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first litigation decisions on the subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors chairwoman violated the first amendment to the Constitution when she blocked a voter from her Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) after using Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, affordable postal spending had a similar effect as the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800 quadrupled the amount of newspapers and anonymous scriptwriters stifled his manner of management.
And even then, Washington had to breast-feed with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington decisions to the ground.
According to historical documents gathered under the web-based George Washington letter collection project, his office was buried under petitions criticizing his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't force them to remain silent.
Freedom of speech, disagreements and debate are the foundations of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home territory comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European front-runner Ronan Rafferty is hoping for a home territory comfort in the next three days as the 25 th Scottish Senior Open takes place at the East Lothian Renaissance Club Golf Courses.
The Northern Irish, who was leading the last round on the neighbouring Archerfield Links' runways last year before Paul Eales downgraded, has become embroiled in the new venue and is filling the role of tournament ambassador instead of club founder and chief executive Jerry Sarvad.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built, and now we see the club shining in full glory with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players see the track at its best, it's in a brilliant state.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He is an avid supporter of the golf game and is proud of what has been achieved here.
It allows the track to be presented brilliantly. "
Englishman Eales is looking forward to being able to defend the Champions League title for the first time, although the man has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a very special feeling," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off the race calendar a year after my win.
It's magical to come back to this neighborhood.
It's a great place to play golf.
I recall memories from last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always carry in our hearts. "
On the surface of the home turf, the competition also returns to the ball by Gary Orr, who joined the European Tour of the Senior for the start of this year when he turned 50.
The act is his first event in Scotland after taking part in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"Playing at home is always a little more meaningful," Helensburgh's man Orr said.
"You want to do well, but you also feel extra tension.
I've enjoyed playing again immensely, and I've played a pretty good game of golf.
I'm happy with the way things have been going. "
The trio will be joined on the field by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
ORR and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the competition fire, the rest of them being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free and car parking costs a single passenger car £5 and a car with two or more passengers £10.
All proceeds go to the charity organisation Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death on Indonesia's gold-plated land
When Bardina Degei makes dinner, she doesn't use lead.
He rarely even uses a pot.
In a wooden cottage in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region of Indonesia's reluctant Papua province, the housewife places the batate called nota in the local language directly on the fire level.
In half an hour, the charred Muggle will be taken from the fire and eaten eagerly with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the muddy floor  he has no furniture  and he does his day-to-day chores, such as washing his laundry with cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
The role of the camper is filled by a bucket in an unroofed room.
Since she is the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has not been appointed to take care of any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late, however, can be dangerous  most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink hard, plus there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to visit after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
This is a rare glimpse into life in the mountainous land of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was reunited under Indonesia in 1969 after a polish referendum, in which only 1026 old people were forced to vote with their hands raised in front of the troops.
The movement, which encouraged the Dutch supremacy, quickly directed its fury against the government of Jakarta, which still holds the region under its strong control, away from foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and Western Papua, so an independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island.
The enarotal is just as remote and deserted, and to get here, you must fly from the capital of the province to Jayapura for 90 minutes to Nabiress, and then pass the five-hour journey that makes the rental car nauseous.
No public transport.
A city with a population of about 19,000 is made up of tree houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by wavy iron roofs, the rust of which has changed the different tone to yellowish brown.
Very few indonians have made the journey here, not to mention journalists, nor have any foreigners come here at all.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago bowed to a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing clothes like that," Degei says, referring to her colorful hand-woven turban, dark blouse and bright skirt.
"Before that, we wore only plant leaves on the body."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28 percent of people live below the poverty line, and statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are one of Asia's worst.
But it's also a gold-plated land in Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Paniai, a mountainous province with a population of 153 000 in New Jersey, Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua can be prided on by consumer wood supplies, valued at an estimated US $78 billion.
Yet these riches are the source of the suffering of the Pawnees, because they necessitate the suffocating presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times showed that Freeport paid approximately US $20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to US $150,000 to one officer.
The paupers' efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and they are mercilessly transformed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 paapuas have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Commission for Human Rights, the mass killing in the mountainous lands belonging to the Papua tribes was a measure of genocide in the 1970 s.
Last year alone, more than 3900 peaceful protesters were arrested by Indonesian police in the region.
The 2016 report by the Archbishop of Birsbane, "We are losing everything," contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electrocution is particularly common) and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because incidents like this happen every week," says the organisation's Human Rights Watch Indonesia researcher Andreas Harsono.
The screws have yet to be tightened, as Papua's natural resources have caused an influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83 percent of the province's 3.5 million residents are Christians, but demographics are changing as economic migrants arrive from the crowded islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi in Indonesia.
Family diners in jaavalries sell gado-gado with crispy chicken and mixed kitchen vegetables served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"The migrants started selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaply from local pawns," explains Paniais-born 24-year-old Abeth You, who moved to the province's capital Jayapura for work.
"The indigenous paapuad  paapua mama-mama's [women]  will therefore lose their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is known among the crowd as Jokowi, pledged to address these inequalities and human rights abuses in Papua in his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter won on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace from Papua's 29 constituencies of 27, including Paniai.
But in Papua, very little has changed and the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes regarding the restoration of justice," You says.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai was in a low position.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children were singing Christmas songs by a fire in Enarotal when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorbike from the darkness.
The appalled children told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, intoxicated soldiers chased the children and beat them with the handles of their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, was beaten so brutally that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, a nearby Electoral Commission building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated further.
Around 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered to claim justice on a football field in front of a local police station and a military command centre.
They were wearing ceremonial hunting strips and presented a waita dance by the Papua honey pago tribe, during which a bird song was run around and hiked.
Some of the protesters began throwing stones at the police and the militants.
In a flurry of resentment, troops were sent an order via the inside radio. "If the crowd points to resistance more than three times, shoot them," according to an official document seen by TIME magazine, but not issued to local media outlets.
The elder Yeremias Kayame (56), of the Kego Koto part of the enarotal city, sensed a menacing threat and called for peace to be preserved, prompting the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"Turning around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he told TIME in his vivid colors on the porch of the tree house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but says the bullet came from rows of gathered soldiers.
"There were lots of people, lots of shots," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed his shooting.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," he told TIME gloomily in Yohane, who uses only one name like many indonians.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only ensured the security of their station since it was attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when we are threatened with murder," Papua Police spokesman Commissar Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and there were numerous injured.
The news of the killings didn't arrive in Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura, where he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the misdemeanours in Paapua.
"I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism for solving crimes against human rights that have occurred.
But almost immediately, apologies also followed.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990 s and early 2000 s.
The thing is, we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes, "he said.
Speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, however, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying that he had no intention of establishing a mechanism in Papua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, "everything is settled by law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said 11 crimes against human rights had already been solved in Paapua, including those in Paniai.
The families of the paniai victims accepted such claims with grim mistrust.
"I've been interrogated four times in the last three years, but no progress has taken place," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Paniai are afraid to dissolve the incident.
He said he got beat up by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the Deiyai neighbourhood of Paniai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, after going into a sieve between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to transport the unconscious man to hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to police, villagers threw rocks at police officers, upon which the latter responded with warning shots.
But according to locals, the mobile brigade (Indonesian military-backed police) started shooting at the crowd, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, afraid of retaliation," TIME's 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured being carried in.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The deiyai parliament has called for the prosecution of the police involved and for the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troubled place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the honey, moni, dan and damal tribes living in Papua's greyish central mountain land.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL)  an army of rebels which, according to them, protects the rights of paapuans by conducting random attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of "protecting the sovereignty of the country," the military has arrested thousands of people in Paniai over the past few years.
Some of them never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as a "tragic forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as unreachable.
People grow all their food themselves  mainly batate, plus a bit of fruit and leafy vegetables.
Field education is the work of women, each of whom is able to maintain four or five batate fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, the rest selling on the local market.
Ten batates cost just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have worsened between the paddles and the new migrants who have arrived at Nabire airport since the opening of new routes.
Those few jobs that exist will go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
Skippers themselves often lack capital or the necessary skills to conduct competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribes Council.
Separation keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
In addition, tough restrictions on foreign media persist.
Towards the start of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were sent out of Papua because of "they did not follow relevant practices," although they had been given a rare filming permit.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of the Asian Department of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election promises to remove restrictions on reportages to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"Journalists seeking reportage from Papua's most eastern restless provinces and West Papua in Indonesia are threatened by new threats  visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a drilling look at the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's closest neighbours.
In March, six Pacific countries  Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands  urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various widespread crimes" in Paapua, including the shooting of Paniai.
The same countries have historically supported the VPL as well.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's accusations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "There is still democratic order and freedom of the press in Indonesia, so evidence of human rights incidents would be hard to bury."
Local people want more foreign governments to take notice.
When the Dutch official delegation, headed by the country's human rights ambassador, Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people interrupted their silence, according to a source who had been present at the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, urging them to: "We want freedom."
There will be a new presidential election in Indonesia in 2019, but paapuas don't think they will vote for Jokowi again.
"The jokowi is a man of good intentions but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Tribes Council chairman Hobai.
He wants to let Jokow understand that, in addition to the fact that the people of Paniai are constantly living under the threat of a predatory military, they are suffering misery because of poor education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniai, like the rest of the willows, regard their voice to Jokow as a debt to be paid.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
In spite of the threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims were able to cope with yet another symbolic counterattack by burying the body of one of the victims on the ground opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be brought to their feet, at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with a lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire engulfed Dubai Torch skyscraper for second time
The fire eased through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from that 337-metre-high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that has been ravaged in just two years by a high-rise, which happens to be called the Torch, or the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of the fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up at the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50 th floor, "one resident told Reuters, who called himself George.
According to Dubai Civil Protection Officers, firefighters extinguished the blaze at around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for victims.
This incident may again raise questions around the world about the safety of materials used on the periphery of high-rise buildings.
An investigation conducted following the 2015 fire of Torch's board found that the most damage was suffered by facades - exterior decorative panels and insulation.
Britain's police have said they believe London's Grenfell Tower insulation and facade panels may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that worked there in June, in which around 80 people died.
Watch: These phones will probably become sales hits in the fall
Spring and autumn is a sweet time for tech fans, because then phone manufacturers will disclose their new top models.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came on sale, with new hits for poelettes expected in the autumn.
According to Tele2 marketing and sales director Kristjan Seema, today's flagship is characterised by an innovative design, an eye-iris scanner, an edge-to-edge 4K resolution screen and an ultra-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the front of the sales table of Estonian smartphones, generated great excitement in the technology world.
Autumn allows smarter people to get even more high-speed charging, a more durable battery, a higher quality camera, and more water and dust resistance.
He added that it was already possible to make assumptions and predict the four top models that would probably conquer the sales tables this year.
These four top models of smartphones will still reach the poelettes in the fall of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to reach poelettes by mid-September.
There are rumors about what the new Apple model looks like and what it could do is spread a lot.
While the iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences alongside the iPhone 6 s, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to make the new model fully separate from the earlier ones.
There are four colours spoken: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is lost, and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple design manager JonyIve insists the new iPhone model looks like a smooth glass.
There has also been talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to the eye-iris scanner, wireless charging, and a more high-quality camera, you can expect a faster A11 processor.
Surely this is one of the year's most anticipated smartphones.
The pre-order of the brand-new model Galaxy Note 8 will begin on August 23.
There are a lot of rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 is going to look like.
It is said to be even more business-user, and S Pen offers even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wide angle and the other with a narrower field of vision.
Right now, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test, which is certainly comparable in quality to the iPhone 8.
However, we are looking forward to August 23 rd.
Although Nokia has brought three smartphones up for sale this year with the Nokia 6 at the forefront, there is still a shortage of their flagship - the Nokia 8, which is already being presented on August 16.
We expect a 5.3-inch edge-to-edge display from Nokia and an ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
Nokia also talks about aluminium housing and a significant level of water and dust resistance IP68.
Similar to Samsung, the new Nokia model has two rear cameras, the optics of which are produced by Zeiss.
While Sony's firm flagship has been XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near term, with even more innovative features.
Let's wait for a smartphone that's a little more modest than XZ Premium, but with at least the same good or better camera.
On Sony's new model, it has been speculated that its screen will be at least six-inch.
Whatever the reality, we will be able to see soon enough, as, traditionally, Sony has made its autumn flagship public at the IFA International Technology Awards, which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico on payment for border wall
The Washington Post disclosed transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian heads of state.
On January 27, Trump made a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto urging the latter to stop publicly declaring that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president cracked a wall with him over public condemnation, saying, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump erected his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published revealing a tense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take on refugees heading to Australia is "ridiculous," "lousy" and "stupid." He argued that the agreement, made during the Obama government, would leave him a "dumb" impression since he has proposed a ban on resettling refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the call by telling Turnbull that "dealing with the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The State Court did not take into consideration the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in the case where the city of Tartu rejected their tender for the procurement of bus line transport from July 2019 to 2029.
This is an order rejecting the tender of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in Tartu bushankel as the tender did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, head of the Tartu City Government Legal Service.
This is the procurement of public bus service within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP Linna Liinid appealed the decision of the Tartu District Court to the State Court.
The State Court did not take any action on this.
While on social media many complain that the noise coming from the Weekend Festival bothers their nightmares and the whole town is full of party-goers in intoxication, there are many who don't have a bad word to say about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised the celebs in the store were so polite!
I didn't see any blurred being or being rude.
Even I saw kindness, says Laine.
"It's nice to come, be, and enjoy Pärnu, which is hibernating in winter," he adds cheerfully.
The sound of a clump coming from the beach doesn't disturb Laine's sleep.
While living in the middle of town, he could still hear music playing on the beach, now the music hasn't even reached his home wall.
"But I hope I hear," he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who also spoke to the Evening Light, says that the major festival is rather good for Pärnu, which is a good way to bring about the turnover of local merchants.
He also rejoices that so many outsiders have come to visit the summer capital.
You don't disturb a woman with party-like toys.
Even though I'm not sunbathing on the beach anymore, it's nice to see the beach revived.
And glad the crowd is moving and it's been like this three times," says the woman.
It must have been a little worse the first time.
"Then maybe there were complaints," he muses.
But what he said was the fashion on the beach for the summer captains.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town," speaks Harri, the headteacher in the park.
His life's rhythm has not been shaken by the melu and mortar.
But for what?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this interethnic interaction would be better.
Loud music doesn't kiss a man.
It doesn't bother, even though I live nearby.
"Good people can hold together and there's no trouble," he says.
The guests who came into the wreath are, according to him, polite.
"They have exaggerated a little, of course, with bottles, but young people are young and, God forbid, let go, but be human and we can do it!" he says.
The people on the beach have travelled away by then, either to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival affects life positively - people like that kind of melu," says Tiina, who has walked with children in Pärnu.
His family's sleep in festival music is not too disturbing, though last year it came even further than this year.
Last summer the stage was the other way round, then we heard more.
We live out of town ourselves, that it actually sounds pretty good to the far side of the Pärnu River," he says.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to revive business
British education company Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividends by 72 per cent, thereby launching another restructuring programme to tackle the business's threatening narrowness.
The jobs to be lost, according to chief executive John Fallon, will be highly likely in late 2018 and early 2019, adding to the 4,000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May a plan to cut costs by another £300 million (US $394 million) under the third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business that has suffered a blow due to the rapid digital learning transition.
The company, which agreed to sell a stake in Penguin Random House last month to its partner company Bertelsmann, said their expectation in relation to the year has not changed since the reported 1-per-cent increase in sales to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked military convoys in the Afghan capital Kabul, according to officials, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the latest in a series of acts of violence that have plagued Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a Herat mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people in Kabul near the Iraqi embassy.
A NATO statement said the Thursday evening explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with "a man-worn self-made explosive."
According to the statement, all of the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at a US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
According to correspondents, the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), are an increasingly growing force in Qarabagh for forces in NATO's Bagram, a serious source of concern.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb in Kabul mainly killed at least 30 people in the Shiite district.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bomb attack in the city centre killed more than 150 people - the most likely military attack in the country since U.S. - led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
This violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while United States President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops helping the country's military and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA annulled the decision to postpone the order of stay after the actions
The United States Environmental Protection Agency  EPA reversed a decision to delay the introduction of an Obama-era regulation that obliges states to limit exhaust emissions causing smog, one day after 15 states sued the agency because of the move.
The EPA announced the decision to proceed with "2015 ozone determination operations" late Wednesday, saying it would show the agency's commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe we need to engage in dialogue with partners from our states and to hear them," EPA leader Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced the EPA's intention in June to postpone ozone determinations  which measure pollution in different parts of the country to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to meet the stricter air quality standard.
15 mainly democratic states filed a lawsuit with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, saying the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has been trying to pull back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama. according to Trump, it is part of a more comprehensive plan to boost growth.
But those endeavours have created counter-reactions among Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the impact of increased pollutants on human health.
The EPA's website states that inhalation of air containing ozone "can reduce the functioning of the lungs and increase the risk of becoming ill with respiratory diseases," such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
Germany's pigs and cattle may come to a party as strong rains threaten the prey of the European Union's second-largest wheat producer, writes Bloomberg.
This year it may be so that weeks of sawdust before harvest may mean that fruit intended for the bread industry is only suitable for feeding to animals.
"The quality of wheat is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Agravis Raiffeisen analyst Bernhard Chilla.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can go into animal feed, which is double compared to conventional, Agravis forecast.
German farmers, like their European colleagues, have been exposed to all weather this year.
First the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June was replaced by a heatwave.
In July, Germany was hit by sawdust, which has also continued in August.
The eyes of many have been turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five percent of wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area has not yet started harvesting, reported local catch collector Ceravis.
"It's a pretty difficult day," said Ceravis senior trader Frank Deckert of Rendsburg.
Consistency in everything, or clever swings of the Finnish interior design
The beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the fairs, because through the great windows the magnificent views of the shores of Saimaa reach many (life) rooms.
Every step of our northern neighbours' efforts to create both rough and perfect (energy-efficient) homes at the same time will be overlooked.
The ability of Finns to use wood as building and finishing material, in the manufacture of furniture and ornaments, also deserves admiration and respect.
Both the builder and the (home) designer can find impeccable techniques and smart solutions in brass houses.
It points out that the black, white, and grey shade communities, when complemented by wood tones and room plants, can be very sensory.
Good ideas can be picked for another week, as the fair runs until August 13.
Accessories and herb pots imply that cooking in this kitchen is often done.
The night before today, the line was drawn down to this year's Weekend Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix, on the main stage, did his best to remember as the last performer.
The crowd was truly turning during Garrix's performance - sung, humilated, danced with forgetfulness.
When Garrix finished, the common mass was spread out from the beach in Pärnu to the city.
We'll bring you a gallery with all the pictures our photographer captured at the Weekend in three days.
Surely you are on some of them too, find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to go face-to-face in the near-future's most heated boxing match to 66.7 kg weight category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN's office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked across the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's featherweight champion.
Following Garcia's unanimous decision to win over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner at Showtime on Saturday, both fighters are included in the front five of the weight table.
Garcia handed over his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you luck. "
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 19 ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be a "perfect measure."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"Moving up for the Broner [to 63.5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm small at 63.5 kg.
I want to move down the lightweight.
And he has to move up the lightweight [61.2 kg], and then we can fight.
The fans have been wishing for it.
Let's offer them that then. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether watching it should be paid. It is part of his strategy that he wants to let Lomachenko debut for the end of this year in a 61.2 kg class to make a possible meeting next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has an interest in fighting the matchup winner of Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their 23 September lightweight title round at Forum.
"Watching this fight could be paid because fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said, later saying he would be open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We are the main players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a "great fighter" and could go see his Saturday matchup.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia, saying that in his mind the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wished for that knockout."
According to Garcia, the goal was to show impact strength and then boxing.
They both confirmed that they felt the tension growing between them.
"This is a fight waiting to be realised.
No other confrontation produces so much attention and buzzing.
I'm more than willing to work for it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been on the stand for the best fighters, and Mikey has just that.
It's going to be a good fight. "
Which corners of the world are being moved to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended and issued a record number of over 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who predominantly have travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
If, for example, last year it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit for 6702 foreigners, this figure was 4928.
The agencies cannot tell how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia permanently, but such analysis will be drawn up at the Ministry of the Interior.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ten years ago, in recent years, that number is starting to get close to 2,000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014, 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, 675 a year earlier.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of citizens of Ukraine increased the most in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia last year more than left.
"The Ukrainian community has been big in Estonia all the time, and due to difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many also family are already ahead," said Interior Ministry press representative Kristin Rammus.
Last year and last month, the number of Ukrainians who had received a temporary residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although the number of temporary residence permits issued to the latter has been the highest in ten years.
If Ukrainians come here predominantly to work, Russian citizens for family migration.
"Given the historic Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the biggest family ties with people living in Russia," said Interior Defense Academy migration researcher Helina Maasing.
"If you look at where the Russian citizens who have received the Estonian residence permit have gone to live, then Harjumaa is immediately Ida-Virumaa," he added, and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit decreased.
"The jump is due to the application for a new residence permit to settle permanently in Estonia instead of the extension of the residence permit," explained Interior Ministry spokesman Rammus, according to whom Russian citizens' interest in Estonian residence permit has remained rather stable for years.
A new residence permit to settle permanently in Estonia can be applied for by foreigners who have lived here for at least three years from the previous year.
Its aim is to encourage adapted people to stay here.
However, a long-term resident's residence permit requires, for example, five years.
Because of the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased.
For example, this residence permit was issued last year to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians can switch jobs and the Estonian state will no longer point the finger at whether the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit became popular with applicants last year (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 people were granted a residence permit to settle in Estonia, including 23 others, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has, surprisingly, become one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, 200 last year.
They come from Nigeria to study at these universities.
In addition, Estonian higher education institutions are popular among, for example, Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen predominantly thanks to learning migration.
In their case, too, the rule is that where the community comes first, there will be easier access to others," Rammus added.
Over a decade, two people have also moved to Estonia from, for example, North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If a year about 6,000 third-country nationals get a residence permit, that's about 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even if citizens of the European Union were to be counted, migration would remain at about a percentage," Maasing commented, in fact, the figures were small.
In total, 14,822 people travelled to Estonia last year, according to the Statistical Office, while 13,792 emigrated from Estonia.
That means immigration exceeded the exodus for the second year.
The majority of those who move out and in are Estonian citizens, but more are among those who leave.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was in the negative last year with 2,000 people.
Estonians, in particular, migrate between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess shop charms with skates, embroidery and tulle
The bottomless idea-house, however, has a history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours in a museum somewhere and admire old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
If you do something with passion, you study and learn more about it every day.
It's the joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem like a stranger to some people, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much brightness you have in your life!
I have a friend who has a whole sauna full of haute couture dresses I've created.
Because it's not her fault that she doesn't live in Hollywood and go on the red carpet every day, she wants to wear those most beautiful dresses, and she does!
You can live your own life special!
The fashion artist does not recognise the gap between bright events and grey weekday.
It was this reasoning that led to the plan to bring high fashion into rural areas in Estonia, between forests and fields, to people whose fashion often does not reach.
The Mammu collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvis and Pärnu fashion alleys, where a royal defilee with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, the pose is often taken in, the nod is dignified, but elsewhere there are more emotions - shouting bravo, getting up, wanting to thank you by hand.
The vast majority of the audience just came across as newsworthy, but now they are fans of the Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people's expectations, they are delighted!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer tour with my fashion creation.
In Pärnu we had a 50 metre red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, they seemed to have no end!
Maria also fails to acknowledge that the creation must be presented to the super-model, and she is happy to bring ordinary women on the stage.
I often invite my own customers onstage - they've always come with joy.
It's such an exciting experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my own show, and I'm always backstage to give it the final polish as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve wouldn't allow me to watch the hall peacefully.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who wants not only to play the role, but to be in everything.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection is by myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, discover.
I'm never far from my creation, and I'm not afraid of work.
The design thing is not limited, including stylists, logistics, organizing, organizing - everything has to fit into one temperamental woman's day.
You know, these hours of work are going to be huge for fanatics.
I can't tell you when my work day ends, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I'm still very lucky - it's like a never-ending chain of happiness: I do something nice, a person gets something nice and, in turn, compliments.
How many times has it been said that there is magic in my dresses - they make themselves feel like a princess.
The abundant barrel satire that made Maria's talent famous overnight has remained the signature of Mammu Couture to date.
Martin Müürsepp of U18 boys: Estonians' sub-group tournament weapon turned now against us
Sorry, the fairy tale ran out.
The first thing I saw was that we couldn't reach our table.
And when such a big gap comes in at the table, there's nothing to do," Estonia commented on the downfall of U18 basketball boys 61: 75 for Britain our only basketball player playing in the NBA, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach Martin Müürsepp.
Opponents took 28 balls off the offensive table and got so many more attacks because of it.
We weren't prepared for their aggressive defense or attack either, it created.
Many of the attacks by the English ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build up the defence.
In defence, however, they could hold hands everywhere, we could not combine.
It kicked the team off its feet.
The opponents' homework was better done.
According to the masonry, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to take down the momentum of its opponents.
Last quarter - we had zero errors but opponents already got several quick baskets.
The athleticism and the intense insistence that was our weapon on the sub-group tournament now turned against us.
Today we had no strength against their aggressiveness.
The mason was left alone with his ward in Kalev, Matthias Tass.
In the tournament in general, good words can be said for the whole team; until today, there was a uniform cup of punches.
It's a shame you've met such an aggressive opponent before.
The cup has been confident all along and played his field today, but it looked like he was tired - he's carried a pretty big load.
But he made some pretty moves I've seen in practice before, "the instructor added.
Terrible numbers: In the maidens' basketball squad, in the EM tournament, three quarters dropped less than 10 points...
In the u18 age bracket, not only do the junior EMI B division basketball tournament go to Tallinn, the maidens started in Dublin the day before yesterday.
And the Estonian game with Poland, unfortunately, tended to be in the field of anti-repetitions.
Estonia lost 25: 65, but after the third quarter, the score was 9:49, or it was only in the last ten minutes that opponents took their feet off the accelerator and that period remained at 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia threw 4, in the third by 1 point...
At the same time, in the first two minutes, two of the first four pitches were struck by the governors, and then 25 by the game, then three by, and then 21 by...
In almost half an hour, 47 pitches of one were caught.
In addition, 2 points came from four free throws.
Ball losses were a reasonable number in that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland's pitching capacity was 33 and Estonia's 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, the opening day had to admit Portugal's 83: 56 right-hander.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to upgrade supplies
TODAY, NATO's 1 st Standing Mine Control Group arrived for the weekend in Tallinn for a planned port visit to upgrade ship supplies and prepare for pre-existing exercises.
During the course of the visit, vessels shall prepare for return to the sea and provide crew members with an opportunity to take a couple of days' leave.
Following the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to conduct a number of exercises and be ready for future historical explosive search operations.
"Estonians' participation in the NATO unit and the collaborative activities carried out by them in local waters illustrates well our integration with allied forces," said Commander of the Operation and Planning Division in the exercise of the Commander of the Navy Fleet, Capt. Arto Reinmaa.
As of June 29, NATO's 1 st Permanent Mine Counterfeiting Group will be led by Latvian Naval Commander Gvido Laudups, who took over the duties of group commander from Estonian naval officer Capt. Johan-Elias Seljamaa at a ceremony held in Riga.
The group's flagship ship is designated the Latvian Navy support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, which also operates the group's flagship headquarters.
During this half-year, Estonian Navy mine hunter Sakala will also be part of the international unit.
As one of the four groups of ships under the command of the NATO Maritime Command, NATO's 1 st Standing Mine Countermeasures Group is a readiness unit among primary high-speed responders, which the Alliance can send to different locations around the world within five days.
Until August 4-13, the ancient ruins of the Monastery of Pirita will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, called by Maestro Eri Klas 13 years ago, will be held.
This year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to the artistic director of Tallinn Philharmonic, Risto Joosti (36).
Risto Joost: Listeners to the opera world classics include "Traviata" and "Tosca," ballet discoveries from the fascinating "Bolero" to the fun "Karlsson," and also lack an own production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratory "Aastaajad" by the same international creative team that, in 2015, even brought Haydn's masterpiece "Loomine."
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre openings.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It's a festival whose fascination takes hold and never really discharges again.
Because the experience that a listener can experience in this vast and mysterious environment makes human souls ring and touch human perceptions in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't Maestro Eri Klas's shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klass, it's been a lot of help.
He directed me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of the diriging career.
Maybe that's why it makes it easier for me to keep working for him.
Eri Klas has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it's all transferred to me as well.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things work.
It was the great heart of Eri Klas that gave me the strength to go on with the Birgitta Festival in the Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What could excite an audience at a festival this year, what special are you offering?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, by the way, the first ballet, written on Astrid Lindgren's story, comes to the presentation.
It's "Karlsson's flying."
And one notorious nuance about it is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write this piece.
He must have had a Karlsson character in his soul since he was a child.
Risto, how can you handle all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner for sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have a lot of it.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend so much on other people as on me, perhaps, how I am going to meet every new day.
And such conscious tone-keeping, keeping positivity and actually smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning, greatly increased my percentage of happiness.
Especially now this week, when there are the most important samples, I have practised it particularly eagerly and it works.
Smiling at yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a speech.
I don't think people know half the things that the universe offers them yet, but everyone finds out.
Right now, this is an important moment.
Do you have any kind of ritual before you step into the conductor's remote?
It is, you have to change your clothes for the more comfortable ones.
This is the little moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest or take a little nap before a big show.
In fact, I even like to actively interact with people, even before stepping into the blackout.
But come all the way to the Birgitta Festival, here's what you can discover for a not very great friend of opera and ballet!
Watch the mind-numbing video with Risto Joosti!
New results of age assessment tests for Swedish asylum seekers published
In Sweden, a test was carried out on asyl applicants, in which their age was assessed medically by a novel approach. The latest results show that more than 80 percent of those tested were rated as older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
Sweden's National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing toward the start of this year.
The tests were set up to assess the age more accurately in the course of applying for asylum after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of several allegedly underage refugees.
For now, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the testing, and the Institute of Judicial Medicine has issued a total of 2481 test scores between mid-March 2017 and July 31.
Eighty percent (2002) was rated as 18 years old or older, and in another 25 cases, the Judicial Medical Institute estimated that the test "could be 18 years old or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person was "probably younger than 18."
Tests are only used when a person's age is under question.
According to Johan Göransson, a professor at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent compared to those of the previous months.
"We don't see much difference compared to previous months' statistics, the numbers are quite consistent," he told the newspaper The Local.
That much of the cases were assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asyl applicants have lied about their age.
The institute issued 581 test results in May and said that in 442 cases "there are indications that the person being examined is 18 years old or older."
But when newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of those 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases a person had directly claimed to become 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, which involves X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee joints, after which they are allowed to be analysed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose duties include evaluating the biological maturity of humans to determine whether they passed puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I've had reason to think about it, and I don't think the measuring method currently used should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't make a face that we can, "he told the newspaper Metro.
But Johan Göransson from the Institute for Judicial Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of dissolving a child inaccurately into adulthood is small.
The highest, perhaps at around 10%, is the risk if the person is a little under 18. "

20-year-old hammer thrower Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the London World Cup, getting a good 18 th place with 67.37.
The organ was MMM's youngest female hammer thrower, and the cheerful woman confirmed she hoped to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and got a good experience.
In the first test (64.80) I immediately made my average score, in the second (62.80) I risked too much and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," Orel said after the match.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm really glad I found it.
Anna Maria Oreli's World Cup debut ended in a good 18 th place.
The rainfall didn't disturb Orel, because he was training for winter at the TTU Stadium.
"I'm tempered," he said with a little grin.
The Olympic Stadium in London almost had a full house of people, did Orel perceive people around him or manage to shut himself down?
I sensed, but in a positive way.
Everybody says it gives you more - that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed he would be satisfied with MMM's debut, and there are many more good matches waiting for him: "I came here with the 32 nd, or last, performance of this season, finished in 18 th.
This is a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and MMil, that's the only thing that matters.
I'm taking a good experience, and some days I want to compete for medals.
West-Virgina governor announced party change
West Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced at a gathering Thursday night with President Trump that he would switch parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I will tell you, having prayed and reconsidered... today I will tell you, the Western virginians, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
There were cheers at the gathering.
"So I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to play a different game."
Trump had promised a major announcement earlier at the West Virginia gathering.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not support Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the state's only billionaire, turned out to be elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited the coal business from his father.
His value is around $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) released an announcement Thursday night that "Governor Justice's party shift is another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather prevent the country from getting better again than work for it."
"With just 15 governorships and control over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent rejection of a party that is from end to end leaderless and unable to find a positive and unifying message," RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

CoE praised Russians' honest apology for doping scandal
The gulf's international nincompoop, Sebastian Coe, praised "Russia's Thursday honest apology" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country back into the sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, the Russian Enlightenment's nose man, said at the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Championship, that the competition ban imposed on his country was correct and had a firm aim to combat doping.
He apologized to "all the gullible people who have been snatched from the gold and silver medals in the competition."
Despite his comments, the IAAF congress voted to leave the race ban in force, which was imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"In my opinion, today was a very honest response, a very honest presentation," IAAF president Coe told journalists.
"The entire council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian subunion also acknowledged itself that they have had quite difficult times and are doing everything possible to restructure the subunion."
According to CoE, he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its reinstatement.
"I believe today was a very constructive day and there is going to be progress, but congress supports the working group's proposal that now is not the right time to withdraw Russia," Coe said.
"We have to do everything possible in the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the corrupted system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian lightweights who meet the IAAF's strict criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the lightweight world championships in London on Friday.
The head of the iaaf Task Force, Rune Andersen, said Monday that Russia does not yet meet several criteria for reinstatement.
After a report to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that doping control was still inadequate and that the banned coaches were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution will significantly change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only will the electric car revolution substantially change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mining giants like Glencore can say that from one place they win and from another they lose, smaller mining companies do not help.
Currently Glencore earns from coal and oil, but in the future era of electric cars, demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel is growing.
This year, contributions to the proliferation of electric cars have been raised by the decisions of the governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway, which allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades.
As a result, Volvo has already announced that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring a cheaper Model 3 electric car to the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that more electric cars will be sold in just two decades than cars using oil-produced fuels.
"In terms of some metals, it changes everything," Capital Economics commodity analyst Simona Gambranini told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, which have been growing in demand for years.
There are about three times more coppers in electric cars than in a conventional car, Glencore reported.
Even more copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates it will increase copper demand by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in battery demand for electric cars means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glencore is benefiting from a growing trend of electric cars in the wake of rising copper prices and being the world's largest cobalt producer, Jefferies Group forecast.
This brokerage company estimates that Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals are the winners of the electric car race.
The market is reacting to an already changing trend.
This year, the London Metal Exchange has grossed 70 percent.
The price increase last year was 37 percent.
Copper has also increased 14 percent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's stock rose 20 per cent in London, having surpassed rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo Americans by price rises.
On the losing side, the lead companies like Recyclex and Campine have to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of lead is electric-powered batteries for petrol and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless another purpose is found that could overcome the decline in demand," said Bank of America Merrill Lynch, head of metals market analysis, Michael Widmer.
The impact of the loose trend in the form of lead price movements has not yet been noticed.
Lead has tumbled 17 percent this year, with it the best metal in London from rising prices among key industrial metals.
Investors will see problems to the metal only far in the future.
"I'm not sure that for lead it's that bad because cheap oil keeps conventional cars in competition," said metal brokerage firm Triland Metals sales manager Herwig Schmidt.
When the demand for lead falls, it is happening slowly.
Maybe that's what will happen in about a decade.
In the meantime, the stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which depend on advanced lead-based batteries at frequent engine start-ups, is being assessed by an international lead and zinc research organisation.
Lightweight metals like aluminum replace steel as a lighter car can drive with less electricity further away.
This explains the additional demand of 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium for the period 2013-2016.
It accounts for 2.7 percent of the total world production of aluminium.
Likely the trend will deepen, Widmer said.
Aluminium has tilted 13 percent this year as rising demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce miraculous light car hulls.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to stand against the bottom line.
"Ultra-strong steel should be the answer to this development," said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of the oil era can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of that precious metal was used as catalysts for diesel-powered cars, reported metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"Many currently high-demand commodities like oil and platinum may not have high demand in the future," said Natixis crude analyst Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that the raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore driver Marc Grynberg said more hybrid cars would continue to be sold from full-electric cars in 2025.
Platinum manufacturers' high hopes in the 10-year term are that Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motosi are being developed on hydrogen-based cars that depend on platinum to produce electricity from hydrogen.
So far, however, this technology has yet to justify itself commercially.
"Diesel appears to be a clear loser on the way towards electric cars," said Exane BNP from Paribas to Brunet.
German car manufacturers suffered a major setback in July as a court in Stuttgart banned the use of diesel in the hometown of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football finance rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's world-record transfer from Spanish football club Barcelona to French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Whatever the consequences of UEFA, the governing body that dominates the European game, which has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, Paris Saint-Germain is still ahead.
UEFA's 2011 fair game financial rules (FFP) mean PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar's transition was funded without huge losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros ($262 million) alone to buy Brazilians out of his contract, and Neymar's salary is starting to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to the French club.
Psg will no doubt be able to cash in on such money to recruit Neymar and add to his stellar lineup, given that the team is funded by a family dominated by Qatar's energy cricketer.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily to recruit players, but they need to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out with their own in the football business.
Ffp laid the foundations for Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs who fall into big debt in search of success would actually deal with cheating and risk a breakdown if banks or owners were to give up support.
Since 2011, FFP will focus on monitoring their losses instead of the clubs' debts.
The change means the business model, first used by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential and then make big spending cuts to make the team better and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
During ffp's current three-year assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs could carry losses of up to €30 m.
And despite Platini being shunned in 2015 by disgruntled presidential contender Alexander Ceferin, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, remains committed to obstructing excess spending.
"The ffp is definitely not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," said last week to The Associated Press's Andrea Traverso, an FFP supervisor at UEFA.
Although PSG paid for Neymar's buy-out clause as one complete payout, they are able to split that amount into parts for accounting purposes throughout the term of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, which makes it possible to show the transition fee over the next five years as a sum of €44.4 million per year.
In the first wave of ffp sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with Manchester City owned by Abu Dhabi, received the most severe penalties in the neck.
A fine of 60 million euros (at that point $82 million) was imposed on psg, which was later reduced to $20 million, and the club was required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outlaw regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their incomes through companies linked to the club's owners.
While the Qatar company may sponsor PSG, if the value of sponsorship is considered to be above the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This is what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority's PSG support was pompous.
There has been talk that a certain proportion of Neymar's PSG service could come via payments from Qatar for the 2022 World Cup Management Committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny Neymar could become a World Cup ambassador, and argue UEFA regulators could easily reveal such a maneuver.
Penalties previously imposed on psg mean UEFA will be even more vigilant in relation to any attempts to circumvent the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not preemptively discussed Neymar's transition with PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed as they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
Most recently published reports show that PSG made more than $10 million in profit during the 2015-2016 season at around $542.4 million in turnover.
Data from the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hope Neymar's arrival will work well on sponsorship deals, merchandising and shirt sales.
The club expects a turnover increase of at least 30 percent in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish League, having clearly been upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, sought to hamper Neymar's transition by claiming that PSG were in breach of FFP with it.
"This is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the country," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG is mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's stance that the country is funding the club.
"This is a consequence of property rights and has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the country, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of an honest game, as the country may have other ways or other interests, for such a great player to represent the country. "

Today 50 years ago: A hurricane-sized storm in Estonia that ripped roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane named as the storm of the century, which erupted on 6 and 7 August, caused major damage in particular to the Baltic Sea, Harjumaa and Raplamaa.
Wind speeds in northwest Estonia were above 30 m/s during those days.
My old man ran from one curving tree to another in the garden and tried to support them with his hands.
It was all dark and crackling, like the end of the world.
Roofs were already flying from houses in the background, in 2002 old lady Linda Kurova recalled Haapsalu in an interview given to Eesti Loodus magazine.
Linda's husband saw the garden collapse.
But what do you do with your hands on the trees, where do you fight such a storm?
The sea came under the window, water splashed through the windows, "said Mrs Linda, who lived in Haapsalu Kalda Street at the time.
The fact that the roads were full of trees, and that the roof of the platform of the railway station had flown 20 or 30 metres away, Linda saw most of the Sharks as they were only the next morning.
According to locals, the trees behind Paralepa were down in logic, some completely down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, and the storm came through the beautiful old trees with a crack and a crack like a war.
Lääne-Virumaa did not suffer particularly badly in the August 1967 storm compared to Western Estonia, but the losses were huge there, the Virumaa Teataja wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Lossipark and Padis Park were wiped off the face of the earth, but the parks in our neighborhood also suffered greatly.
In Tallinn, wind speeds were measured up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
In the Merfield in Tallinn, on the evening of August 6 th, one of the little girlies had shouted: "Mother, mother!
The chickens are in the air and can no longer be signed! "," Virumaa Teataja wrote.
The Põlli Manor building in Viljandi County was destroyed during the storm so much that it was decided to be demolished later.
There was no resistance to the August storm to the structures of the Turkish ski jump mountain, which were not later restored.
The Red Star newspaper wrote on 12 August 1967 that the clearing of towns and settlements from fallen trees and their branches is slowly progressing, and the inhabitants could be involved in the harvesting.
Fruit fields were also badly affected in the storm, and the newspaper reported that "party organisations must be both for the restoration and for the fertilisation and for the direction."
Hurricanes can be talked about in case the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of outbreaks of wind in Estonia persists from November 2, 1969, when Ruhnul measured wind speeds of 48 m/s.
On the island of Vaindloo, a measuring tool was broken, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
Secret of clean bathing beaches: night cleaning and poor beach weather
Colder summer weather also means smaller harvesting effort in Tallinn bathing beaches.
"If it's weather, people are on the beach, and if it's not, there's no people," says the beach janitor.
Seagulls screaming at North Tallinn Stroomi beach.
They are exposed to melodic competition by a tractor that bends at low turns and plows down stripes.
In fact, the last one, seven centimetres deep, sifts through the sand, picking out the sea debris and the debris left behind by humans: bottle caps, cigarette butts and more.
People still come to the beach regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If it's beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if it isn't, there aren't people," says private company Haabersti Haldus beach cleaning manager Aleksandr Usov.
It's 6.30, and there's a rough cleaning on the beach, because at eight o'clock the place must be fine for people.
USOV is already on the job at four o'clock.
Besides Stroomi, he keeps an eye on the beaches of Pirita, Lake Harku, Lake Kakumäe and Long Island Pikari.
The amount of trash has decreased.
Years ago, there was a lot more of it.
People can now appreciate what is being done for them," says Usov, who has been cleaning the beaches for 15 years.
Before, when something new was put up, it was broken the next day.
Now they're holding what's on the beach.
Clean beach price
One of the great works on the beaches of Estonia is the harvesting of sea trash, which is also a waste of water, washed ashore.
At Pirita Beach, for example, it has to be shipped 400 000 tons on a beach season.
"It's an incredible amount," Usov notes.
The second major category is domestic garbage, which is all that people leave behind.
On the half-second-kilometre Stroomi beach strip, there are eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
So much makes up garbage.
However, colder summer weather has meant that the rubbish is down by a fifth less than otherwise.
The third species is made up of abandoned things.
Most of the time, they're children's toys.
As a result of this, Usov has scooped out a dozen model cars from the sand.
They wait for the owners on the wooden road to the beach.
"Usually more of them come out, but this is a normal harvest." Usov already knows that he will soon find them again in the sand.
Kids come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
Garbage is scattered
Haaberst Management Services spokesman Erika Scholler concedes that tractor screening works are distracting locals.
The noise, which runs from the hours of the night to the early hours of the morning, interferes with the dreams of people living next door.
In the day, however, this job is impossible.
In one month, the beach must be screened twice.
"If we don't, the city section will fine us," Scholler notes.
But the goal is, like Pirita, Pikari and Pärknife, to also get Stroomi Beach under the international blue flag quality mark.
"Compared to Europe, Estonia has a lot more work to do so that the beaches are maintained," Scholler says.
We have more adru and stones and harder to parse the sand.
However, there is less trash in our beaches than anywhere else in Europe.
When Martin, who is near Stroomi Beach, is heard talking garbage on the beach, he walks uneasily into the conversation between the journalist and the cleaning staff, highlighting the current bottlenecks of the beach.
There's a gross picture everywhere in the mornings.
The problem is with the birds and the bottlers who have pulled the garbage bags upside down," Martin reports.
Although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their behaviour so far, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about the garbage cans and, for example, put on their lids to prevent at least the birds from going on the news.
Overall, however, Martin is pleased with the development of the Stroomy beach.
It can be seen that the city will take care of it.
With children's fields, illuminated and freshly asphalt roads, it has become more pleasant.
It used to be that there was only one way to drive on roller skates," Martin notes.
Treasure hunter's findings in Stro: coins, only coins
A 40-year-old Dimitri, who, as a treasure hunter, combines the edge of the beach with a metal detector, has come to use the morning manor period.
He doesn't think he'll find anything valuable today or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough for that.
"I've been dealing with it for a year and haven't found anything of value so far," says Dmitri.
As a hobby hunter, Dmitry's treasure bag has some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous pounds that are later thrown into the bin.
It's usually coins.
"There is no gold, no rings, no such thing as usual," says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the former level as weak economic growth and inflation relief have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain languid as households' lagging incomes have put interest rates on hold.
Policymakers at the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep 6: 2 rates at 0.25 per cent and fewer members are calling for a rise this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank trimmed the 2017 growth forecast to 1.7 per cent and 2018 to its 1.6 per cent, and warned that pressure on household incomes would persist as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank also signalled that increases in rates will be necessary in the next few years to curb inflation due to Brexit, and a higher rise in borrowing costs could be needed in the financial markets than expected.
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package, which was brought about by Brexit a year ago.
The bank will end a fixed-term funding scheme in February that offers cheap funding to banks, although said it now expects a £15 billion higher offer under the scheme, which is £115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says: "In the MPC central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain insolvent in the near future as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption."
On rates, it was reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy is necessary to mitigate inflation" and that this is "somewhat higher" than expected in the markets.
The stock market is currently predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and the second rise in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any jumps are incremental and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to forecasts for May of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for 1.8-percent growth for 2018 remained steady.
After this news, the pound's rate fell relative to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and 0.4 per cent to $1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened growing hopes of a rise  GDP rose 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
The bank says growth is likely to persist at 0.3 percent in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will start to gather some momentum.
The bank's latest inflation report gave households suffering from rising inflation and wretched pay rises little reason to rejoice, saying the situation would get a little worse before it improved.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent income shocks in the next few years, but towards the end of the three-year forecast, wages are expected to recover significantly.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also being cheered by growing demand for British produce, which partly compensates for lower costs for consumers.
The decision comes a year after rates were moved to 0.25 per cent last August after a shocking EU referendum caused the pound to suddenly weaken.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully blow life on prices and the economy.
Before the bank's latest decision, there was a sense of growing demand for rate increases as inflation had increased pressure on tight households; in July, three policy makers demanded the rate be raised to 0.5 per cent.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month compared to 2.9% in June, although according to the Bank this was expected and there will be a rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess growth compared to the 2-per-cent target was due to a completely weak pound.
Coreco mortgage brokers head Andrew Montlake said: "Given the recent drop in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming increasingly competitive again as lenders crave work and hope to end the year in a positive way.
The stock market seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are beginning to come to an end, as refinancing, often at a fee-free and low rate, has become increasingly popular. "
The NHS is about to prescribe 10,000 people with the HIV drug that has created a contradiction.
Patients have had access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment since September after a battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England reported that National Health is now making an estimated 10,000 people available for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill during the initial three-year clinical trial, which is administered before intercourse and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection by around 86 per cent for people at high risk.
The NHS agreed to fund a clinical trial after an appeals court upheld the Supreme Court's ruling last year that the NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite the agency's own claims that the drug should be funded by local governments instead.
NHS Englands chief executive Simon Stevens hailed the move made public on Thursday as a "new major intervention," while the National Aid Fund (NAT) described it as a "pivotal moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start registering people. There will be further clinics in October before the programme will be deployed everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medicines taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking prep before intercourse means that there is a sufficient amount of certain medicines in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
Such medicinal products may be taken on a daily basis or at the latest two hours before intercourse.
Candidates eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment.
Clinicians identify suitable people who are willing to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people, and those whose HIV-infected partner does not receive antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their wish to participate at the local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to get the drugs this week after an international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the actual potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who the medicinal product is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new large-scale intervention should complement and amplify the widespread and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades-long struggle for one of humanity's greatest health problems. "
Deborah Gold, chief executive of NAT, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
Prep, if targeted correctly to those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers the opportunity to change England's HIV epidemic.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England through this NHS-funded clinical trial have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and not dependent on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "It is now a priority to ensure that clinical trials across the country are quickly triggered and that none of the HIV risk groups are set aside.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been acquired, we are on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of being infected with HIV.
Public Health shadow minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and badly delayed after months of delays and dragging the government's feet.
The evidence shows how big changes this drug can bring to HIV prevention work and the cessation of the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that clinical testing be introduced across the country as soon as possible to protect people who have exposure to HIV and take us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society. "
The price of electricity increased by 12% in Estonia and decreased in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference in the stock price for the next day of electricity between Estonian and Latvian and Lithuanian price areas decreased to 1.94 euros compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia, the average stock price of electricity was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour last month and the price rose 12 percent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five percent to $36.27 per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was €34.17 and the system price of the Nord Pool electricity exchange was €26.37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices rose 12 and seven percent, respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved 75 percent of the hours of the previous month towards Estonia and 16 percent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of hours between the two countries did not enter into the next day's transactions.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity moved 99 percent of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 percent of the hours had all the transmission capacity in use.
According to transactions on the last trading day of July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the stock price of electricity in August could be around 34 euros and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the cost of electricity production rose last month and transactions took place at a price of between €5.04 and €5.47 per tonne.
High-life living - Half-floor and smart design links have turned this tiny Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate developer, swapped her large Knightsbridge home for a flat in Earls Court in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold the apartment further is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my former partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something equivalent to the price I was offering.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day. '
Since its first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a full renewal course.
At first it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout - a walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half-floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands, "he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from the acting architecture and design studio Duck & Shed in Notting Hill to take advantage of 3.8 m-high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces on top of one another, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-floor where one could stand.
Erfan had to approach the matter creatively.
"The metal structure is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms so that they were on top of each other without having to bend over.
It was not just the construction of a platform, but we used a steel structure so that the height of both the upper and lower spaces would be correct. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms on top of each other in the room, with many dramatic elements.
From the half-storey, an old-fashioned, copper-lit Retrouvius window opens a view of the glamorous dwelling below.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver details and retro Serge Mouille lighting emphasize the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatricality, spatial and light-coldness.
Mirrors have been added to both ends of the short corridor to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with the mirror gives the appearance of a window opening into another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage place for all Joanne's cutlery and glass dishes.
The living room is filled with the charmed opportunity to close the kitchen part when it is not being used, creating an image of a more glamorous room.
Folding kitchens is nothing new.
However, there is a unique fact about this kitchen that it is a garage-type revolving door.
"It went into a bit of design trouble," Erfan explains of the steel-strength spooned MDF door.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it glides very easily when pushed up."
With the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra rooms, an extra bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"After all, the floor space is what you sell - or what gives value to the property," Erfan says.
"A real estate agent walks into a room in outdated form and performs calculations based on floor area."
Here they have been able to increase the floor space, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"The materials are the ones you touch and that thereby help to create an emotional connection with the home," Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical cable on the wall.
It's important but doesn't make the heart's tongues ring. '
It shows that good design and enlarged area help make something amazing out of a fairly ordinary apartment.
In fact, they may make a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
Chief character Dane Jensen is a bounty hunter in a Chicago skyscraper who competes with a colleague for a promotion.
All that matters is the amount of money earned, and all ethics are forgotten.
He sees his wife and three children only early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I catch myself thinking that it's the business world version of "House of Cards" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech frame is similar.
The more the film goes on, the less the frame-length element remains, and the filmmakers' moralising intent begins to emerge more and more.
In life-changing experience, the main character becomes a son's illness with cancer.
A choice must now be made between work and family life.
A son dreaming of an architectural profession makes his father's walks to the great buildings of Chicago think about truly important things like faith, goodness, love... not even a disaster for the twin towers.
After the third scene in which the son opens his father's eyes, there is a feeling that the filmmakers have been driven by the goal of making the audience cry, for even the most ardent-hearted viewer can't hold back tears at the sight of the suffering of a lovely cancer-sick boy.
When his son falls into a coma and his situation seems hopeless, his father will finally understand the morality of his work and do a good deed to an old man looking for work.
Now I'm betting with myself - if the film has a happy self, I'll reward my perceptions after the movie with coffee, if I'm wrong, I can praise the writer for at least one surprise.
For a moment there is a suspicion that the remains of the coffee will be lost - when the husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man rushes slowly down the corridor towards the ward.
The son, however, has been wonderfully healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be a positive one, for now there is time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can predict the end of the American drama quite well already!
To be true, the film is well constructed, all the elements necessary for it are there.
Can cry, can laugh, actors are good and moral beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure this movie will come in well.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can handle it for real, too.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the White House's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information reaching President Trumpin, including the news, in the hope that it will keep the chief in more level water.
Here's a cover from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the White House's new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with high-ranking officials on his first day in office, he brought out a key problem to President Donald Trump's White House, which he planned to solve by getting some of the bad information into the president's hands.
Kelly told officials that the information "needs to move through him, either on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if good information was shared to him."
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but so have others trying it and they have failed to tame Trump with his monitoring of media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television stretches back decades and also now that he's in the White House, his TV viewing habits have gone nowhere.
"When candidate Trump was upset about the dishonest media coverage, it was worth pointing out that he was also being reported honestly in the affected publications," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "according to six former campaign workers, the key to controlling Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption also includes praise songs in a stable way."
All right.
But the idea that the habits of Trump's Twitter use have ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know  that Trump's tweets would have been even more ignitious without these interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets Trump didn't post.
If his assistants could save him from trouble a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from consistently producing polemics.
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing cliches, people are trying exclusively to promote their own interests by passing on material to Trump that supports their worldviews, but may not always be credible.
In May, Politico wrote about the advisors' tendency to feed strategically questionable information to the president.
One of the examples, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher, is:
"Current and former Trump subordinates say Trump may respond to the negative press, especially with damaging impact on leaflets, explosively, by obsessing over the identification of their source.
This was also the case in late February, when someone gave the president a ferociously printed copy of an article on a website belonging to the Internet provocator, Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff, Katie Walsh, of being the "source of several leaflets" of the White House.
It makes no difference that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of the mockery, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has also made false accusations in the past and taken them back.
Trump read the article and started asking the subordinates about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff Reince Priebus and the head of the White House office, Rob Porter, "have attempted to establish a system for managing and documenting documents that reach Trumpin."
How did it succeed?
Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will turn out to be a more effective leader from Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his aides are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad in the capital don't get permission to perform.
There's a lot of foreigners kissing in downtown Tallinn.
Those with whom the Evening Lights spoke admitted to playing in the Old City without the permission of the city government.
The first thing we found was three street musicians near the gates of Viru, who had taken as many dogs with them.
It was clear that the musicians in the robes and the bursting clothes were backpack travellers who could use a shower.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the company played a story with fun rhythm at the accordion, while a man next to her gongled with three balls and invited passers-by closer.
A third man had sat next to them on a backpack and was smoking a ready-made splash in a heartbeat.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing crowd.
Bob, who played the accordion with Noem and balls, talked about kissing on the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the company's appearance was to collect the ticket money for a ship going to Finland on the evening of the same day.
Noem and Bob shook their heads at the question of whether they'd asked the city for a kiss in the old town.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or two and mostly are given permits for a month or something.
There's no point in paying for it," Bob explained.
When we got back to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw two women at the musicians and drive them away.
The company moved with backpacks and dogs to the intersection of the Viru Centre for happiness.
There were also three Polish youths on Viru Street, one playing the violin, the other a clarinet, and the other one carrying an electronic piano.
"We're here to give people entertainment to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living," explained the trio's pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that a city government permit must be in place.
"Of course we don't have it," he said, joking.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we'll go elsewhere, but the try has to," he added.
Eesti Pank bought 149 million euros worth of bonds in July, while the central bank's bond portfolio grew to 4.36 billion euros, as part of the public sector asset purchase programme of the euro area central banks.
The central bank will not publish any more detailed information on purchases.
Hardo Hansson, President of the Bank of Estonia, has previously explained in response to the consultation of the members of the Riigikogu that the asset purchase plan of the central banks of the Eurosystem includes three different purchase programmes: covered bonds, ABS and PSPP.
The central bank is buying bonds from the market in order to encourage investors who have sold bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Under the influence of purchases, the return on lower-risk assets will fall, and this will motivate investors to take bigger risks.
As a general rule, within the framework of the public bond purchase programme, each central bank buys its sovereign government bonds, while other sovereign bonds are not purchased.
As the Estonian state has not issued the bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the volume allocated to them.
Replacement purchases are also made by central banks in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank generally buys bonds from European institutions such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank has been buying bonds in the framework of the asset purchase programme since March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering bonds were also acquired, but in June 2016 Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering bonds.
On behalf of the euro area central banks, since June, both Elering's and Eesti Energia's bonds will be purchased by the central bank of Finland.
Travelers ignore ditch and return to 'millionaires' district
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners have again entered a fierce confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the council's excavated ditch to win back a field away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field in the wealthy "millionaires district" near the baptized Solihull Street.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and lorries after being kicked out of it only in May, without being disturbed by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical team found a weak spot on the defensive, squeezing their vehicles through an unobstructed part that had been left as a footpath.
Furious residents have cursed the Solihull council, saying the council is "useless at dealing with the problem."
One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after their eviction from Bentley Heath, where they threw passersby with stones.
The council needs to be shamed for taking action because they are useless at dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away and now they are back again.
There were more last night, probably more today. "
He added: "The Birmingham council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protect their parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to have to continue paying the council tax if the council can't even prevent such a thing. "
One local resident, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: "This is ridiculous. We just saw the last of these migrants leave, and there is already a new offensive going on.
This time the number has grown, and the horse has even been seen in the grass. "
A spokesman for the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campsite on the land near Streetsbrook Road and we are cooperating with the Solihull Police. We are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
It is very helpful to gather evidence when as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
It helps to create a picture of the situation for the court as we present the case to them. "
The Weekend Festival is also visited by the Minister of Culture, Indrek Saar, who is pleased that the real world's top names have been brought to Estonia.
To the question of why the Weekend festival is so important to Estonians, Saar replies that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the festival three days in full.
But he knows that the real people of his field have arrived in Pärnu.
"By looking at the level of artists that have been able to be brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre are brought home - this often does not happen in our neighbourhood," the Minister of Culture says.
Which of the artists at the festival do the Saart speak for the most?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for old people like me, surely one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
After all, according to his record, all of us have turned our feet at some point, "he says.
But he still brings out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian makers too: starting with NO<unk> P and they can be read a whole line.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high," he says.
Take a long look at the evening sheet video!
Audi renews up to 850 000 diesel vehicles amid criticism over car manufacturers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer a software upgrade for more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to BMW's chairman, the company believes "there are more intelligent variants than driving restrictions," referring to European cities, including BMW's home city of Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel cars.
No company described these actions as a recall.
European car manufacturers have been enthusiastically promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with carbon emissions regulations.
However, nitrous oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of the equipment to be installed to neutralise the exhaust emissions of diesel vehicles for the car industry will increase, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation, the government of Union Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of careering powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring signs pointing to the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid a repeat of Volkswagen's mistakes, who silenced the use of so-called cheating devices, which allowed the exhaust emissions to be adjusted to comply with the regulations while the car was being tested, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been charged in the United States and others are on both sides of the Atlantic under investigation.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics unit of the Audi engine development division was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was pulled into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany after authorities accused the Audi of installing a system to sneak away from European emissions requirements, thereby widening an investigation that had focused on the United States previously.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be a major blow to Volkswagen  the manufacturer of luxury cars generates a disproportionately high proportion of Volkswagen's profits.
European Union flags are acquired for 20,000 euros for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education plans to buy European Union flags to mark the presidency for Estonian schools by September 1.
In total, 570 educational institutions of the European Union flag receive 105 x 158 centimetres.
Flags are designed to be exhibited indoors, they must be carried out in high quality printing techniques indoors also with a tunnel fastening, mediated by the ERR News Portal.
The flag rod label has the text: "A gift to Estonian schools to mark the first presidency of the Estonian Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of the 570 flag is EUR 20 000 for the Ministry of Education, or EUR 35 for one flag.
Journalist's murder highlights growing threat situation in Mexico
Weekly newspaper Riodoce workers typically gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the Sinaloa state's most recent chaos, sown by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But today they are gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They're told it's important to change your routines.
Two senior journalists are debating which seems safer: either bring the children with them to an office that was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the front of the room: "enemies," "neutrals," "allies."
They ask reporters to provide names in each column  no evidence needed, enough impressions and inner feeling.
Drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels and a whole list of malcontents who make it dangerous to report the chaos in Mexico.
There is no pause for breath from violence and the more bodies pile up across the country, the majority of them are journalists  According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, since President Enrique Pena Nieto was sworn into office in December 2012, at least 25 of the 589 journalists are under national protection after attacks and threats, and this year at least seven journalists in seven states have been killed.
The latest fatalities include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence can be deeply felt, though his presence can be felt everywhere  on the facade of the Riodoce building hangs a large picture of Valdez pointing the middle finger with the letter "Justice" and two 30 s reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts depicting his smiling spectacle face or his distinctive panacea hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate Public Prosecutor's Office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been brought to justice.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, the number of which amounts to thousands, the killers of journalists rarely get to justice.
The riodoce editorial continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the information and justice of the murderers, the security meeting, according to Ibarra, is not much use.
"It's really silly to waste your time in this meeting," he says.
"As long as the cause is not known, you distrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital Culiacan on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before two men stopped him at the red Toyota Corolla. He was forced to get out of the car and was shot 12 times. This is expected because of the newspaper's name, which translates as "the twelfth river."
An armed man drove off in Valdez's car and crashed in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She left behind a woman and two grown-up children.
Rumours spread freely in Culiacan.
But there is mostly only silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival cliques struggle to fill a power vacuum.
It doesn't matter that some people or even several are shot every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with abundantly decorated double-decked mausoleums of drug kings larger than the homes of many living.
Let's forget for a moment that peacetime refers to how the seaside state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States is run by only one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was thoroughly aware of the risks involved in his work, Riodoce's co-founder and manager Ismail Bojorquez (60) feels a huge sense of guilt that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes the killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a partner in competition with Guzman's sons and a partner in the war-torn cartel.
This piece of paper may have upset the boys  suspected gang members bought all copies of the edition as soon as they got to the newsstands.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid on another newspaper that reported the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had remained alive for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as a veteran reporter at the newspaper Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce by selling $50 shares.
Bojorquez said that in Sinaloa "it was impossible to deal with the press without addressing the drug problem."
The newspaper, with its bold and honest reflections, gradually gained notoriety, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish vigorous research without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a print from which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the paper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for its Latin American reflections.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for the Committee on the Protection of Journalists (AKK) for its courage to follow Mexican drug schools everywhere it leads.
He admitted openly that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said, accepting the AKK award.
Last October, he said in an interview given to TV channel Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to take on the task that comes with the journalistic profession  another way is to play dumb.
I don't want to be asked what I did when faced with so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on. '
The riodoce collective misses Valdez, a joker who roped like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared embrace and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
She always wore her hat.
He went from office to the El Guayabo bar across the road and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love got him fatal.
His death has also made them doubt themselves how to do their job best and stay alive.
"They don't like being stuck with these women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things weren't supposed to be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is strong self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's how it happened to Javier."
He and others say the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero or any other state home to the toxic association of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees got together for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that only spyware sold to governments had been used to track journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers in the shade of the tree sought relief from the 40-degree heat.
The government appointed them to guard the Riodoce office, which is in a four-storey building in Culiacan's middle-class neighborhood.
Some reporters pondered, half-jokingly, whether these police officers were among those 50 percent police officers who the governor himself has branded as unreliable.
Months have passed since reporters have travelled to mountainous rural areas where control is in the hands of de facto drug gangs.
Riodoce this week's edition addressed three key stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government funds on the governor's home town.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement about who was abducted or how it happened, so you had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knew  The restaurant is a favorite place for both drug traders and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant is registered in the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for almost the entire last century.
More recently, several IRP governors have been accused of widespread coverage of corruption in the context of lawsuits.
Villarreal asked a reporter to write about previous incidents in the same spot, including how Guzman's son, wearing the nickname El Chapo, was rescued from a military raid.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have been looking for a Valdez columnist to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have known before what happened," said the 46-year-old Villarreal, whose cleft build has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels are broken with our sources."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they could never have expected  activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of tags and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration about another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in western Michoacan state three days after the killing of Valdez.
A burned body has been found, and according to officials, it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists have become more vocal across the country, and are scribbling the phrase "SOS press" on sidewalks and buildings as an organised protest.
On that day, Manager Bojorquez will be away in Washington, trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
A day after Valdez's death in a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because of telling the truth.
After that, he asked to be diverted from the reflection of the government's actions, worried that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "surrounded inside" by organized crime, co-culprit state officials and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Narcotic Press," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also done on the orders of politicians and security forces who are in cahoots with organized crime.
Media monitoring group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the assaults on journalists to police and state officials last year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to keep you quiet," Ramirez said.
The murders are obviously bloodthirsty.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter probably signed by a cartel in Los Zetas: "I'm here for my reportage."
Next to his severed head lay a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as a newspaper in the northern border state of El Norte in Chihuahua after the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others let on as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after their manager's murder in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with the lead letter "What do you want from us?" on the front cover.
Some journalists have fled from home states or even the country.
It's a nerve-wracking decision.
It's hard to find work in exile and they still have to pander to the streets to avoid the dangers.
And sometimes they are chased, as probably happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in 2015 in one of Mexico's apartments three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
Those who remain in place and continue to work need to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wished to be a poet, admits that reporting drug trafficking scares her.
"Mexico is on its way to hell and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At the midnight of one recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and sipped beer when suddenly everyone's phones began to vibrate.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people died in firefights between rival gangs and security forces, according to confirmed data.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by several messages left by cartels found in the region.
From the edge of the sidewalk, reporters posted the news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
The front cover of the next day needed a change.
Sirens swooped past another firefight in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the officers on duty to see if they were vigilant.
If they were afraid, at least they didn't show it.
Under a massive portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, on which his middle finger is visible to the whole of Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff delivered in his tracks.
"How could one even think about closing," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him to the streets to do a reportage?"
Dinosaur used protective paint to avoid enemies
At first glance, it feels like a statue, though quite scary.
Scientists have now disclosed the first findings in relation to the incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by the canada miner, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to find that his scaly-covered skin was reddish-brown, and his past had been somewhat "complex."
A reportage published in Current Biology magazine described the creature as "the best preserved armor dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
For the fossil, it is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the chalk era, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation stunned researchers who describe it as "truly significant."
This scaly-covered vegetarian is best preserved by the type of fossil that has ever been found, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, when he was mining at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He caught something that didn't resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to take a closer look.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell paleontology museum.
The next six years were working on extracting the animal from the 2,500-pound (1100-kilogram) parcel.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to go public.
"Rather than squinting a bit, one can almost believe he's asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes into scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisana of the dinosaurs."
As they examined his skin, the researchers found that this plant-eater, although covered in scales and resembling a walking tank, was likely to be significantly endangered by meat-eating dinosaurs.
This large-scale dinosaur used red and white paint to hide from predators, and applied a shadow technique known as a countereclipse, which is also used by many of today's animals.
This, according to experts, allowed the dinosaur to blend better into the surroundings and avoid enemies, as the larger dinosaurs probably hunted him.
This 110 million-year-old creature of the nodosaurs family first came to the news in May and is now visiting the Royal Tyrrell paleontology museum.
Researchers have now studied the creature and named it after Borealopelta's markmitchell museum laboratory, Mark Mitchell, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours exposing the animal.
Thanks to the astonishingly good preservation of the specimen, Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the scales on the animal's body.
They discovered a countereclipse - a method of protection common in the animal state, meaning that the top half of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although the countereclipse has spread, the findings come as a surprise, since Borealopelta is much larger than the animals living today with the eclipse.
It implies that the dinosaur was sufficiently actively hunted by other carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred to conceal as a survival tactic instead of confrontation.
But most of the animals using today's countereclipse - such as deer, zebras or armadils - are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nodosaurus must have really struggled to survive.
"The vigorous hunting of a dinosaur covered with enormous and abundant scales shows how dangerous the crib-era dinosaurs could have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the armour also revealed that the dinosaur skin was reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal to get clues about its life, including the preserved content of its intestine, to figure out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river as it died, thereby reaching the sea with the current, where it sank back to the bottom of the ocean.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to extend much further inland than they are now.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved armoured skin, yet it has remained three-dimensional, maintaining its original shape," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as it did in the chalk age.
You don't have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it - just squinting your eyes and feeling like he's asleep. "
The Cretaceous era was the time when enormous, two-legged, flesh-eating dinosaurs roamed the Earth - the theropods.
Although the rex of all of them King Tyrannosaurus lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could be hunted down by some of his formidable predecessors.
They include the Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 meters) tall, and a monster weighing six tons.
The researchers, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed into the sea after death and it mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, when he was mining at the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is best preserved by an armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is a holistic cone up to the hips.
These creatures were 18 feet (five meters) long on average and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20 inches long spikes came out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe this armoured-plated plant eater was adventuring through the current Western Canada until a flooded river washed it offshore.
But the dinosaur's seaworthy burial site helped maintain its scales in exquisite detail.
The stony remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the noisy scales along the dinosaur's skulls are still covered by skin tendons.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine: "Such a degree of preservation is as rare as a lottery victory.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The stony skin tendons still cover the noisy armor plates on the animal's skull.
The right front leg is lying next to him, and the five toes are stretched upwards.
I can count the scales on his stable. "
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell suffered a total shock.
Just a day after traveling to New York, this St. Louis resident sat on a bed in a rented room via Airbnb while browsing Facebook on the phone.
He came across a post from his former schoolmate.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old youngster and he's still lying on the street."
She was baffled why no one else had posted this information on her stream, which is why she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The posts of the @TheePharoah user were repeatedly shared on her timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis region broadcast live tweets about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black young man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
She posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away but later saw the tweets again in the evening, which this time announced a gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
Photos were shared of police tape and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and held a sign saying "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!."
He looked at the live stream where a police officer stood with a barking dog in front of a group of protesters.
In another video, another police officer allegedly brandished a rifle and yelled, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell recalls how he caught himself thinking: "It's unusual."
""This is not the kind of murder we are accustomed to and what we might call typical."
I felt the creeps of fear at that moment.
I was angry and crying. '
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
Having landed at 23, his father went to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided they were going to Ferguson alone the next morning.
What took place with Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is a central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Whose Streets?"), which premieres in cinemas on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness from the perspective of those who live in that community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter - wearing a floral dress and a matching crown on their head - went to Ferguson, they talked again about the subject they had repeatedly had before this morning - about the experiences and living conditions of the black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for their rights?" he recalls asking himself.
"We're currently driving to Ferguson because police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't take him with me," Ferrell said later.
"What is happening now is... the culmination of what has happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He needs to learn about activism and organizing, and at the same time know the different layers of black experience and living conditions, and what we need to do to get free and free ourselves.
Even if I succeed in raising her so that she does not personally experience blatant racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel I'd do him a favor if I protected him from this world. "
The first stop they made when they reached Ferguson was on the South Florissant Road, a police station across the road that had become a campsite of a certain kind, where activists were waiting for news of a police officer, Darren Wilson, who was not finally charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who was making lunches.
They put food bags together and helped distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism completely changed after August 9," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was president of the Union of Students of Cancer and focused on food justice and health-related inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organizational experience.
It all just worked out. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met one of the film's co-directors, Sabaah Folayan, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was happening.
The question came to Ferrell's mind: "Are you trying to document what is going on or find a story that can be exploited?"
This kind of skepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come into the community and try to benefit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson would not be heard and we wished to do it differently."
Folayan had already struck hands with co-director Damon Davis, a region artist known for activism in connection with death row inmates.
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrell and another six other locals, whom the team behind the film "Whose Streets?" watched for years after Brown's shooting.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, but we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
"For me, it was important how these people were shaped, because they were imagining me."
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was intended to show that the movement was not a "redeemer guide, but a community reunion," as Folayan said - he was the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the finished linateo.
"But I realized that doing this job and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
What's more, Ferrell's story emphasizes and again puts the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement at heart.
Two of the movement's three initiators, who figured out a theme tune #BlackLivesM atter after killing black teenager Trayvon Martin on social media in 2012, are homosexual.
"Black homosexual women in the leading role have kept the movement in general," Ferrell said, "and this is precisely because we have to fight on several fronts constantly.
Black homosexual women "must carry all that burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women."
He argues, however, that "this is not some kind of equal opportunity-creation type thing" - Ferrell was not chosen as the centre of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who had the right energy," he said.
"But it's no coincidence that she was right on the front line, because living as a black homosexual woman at such hubs is a lot at stake.
His energy can be sensed through the screen. "
Meanwhile, news cameras have long disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and police are still fragile.
The conditional sentence for blocking the road during ferrell's demonstration will last for a further 2.5 years.
He describes the social-political atmosphere in the region, which he calls home, as just a "tohuvabohuk."
Nevertheless, he still considers the important mantra he has etched into memory since his entire three years ago took to the streets of Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our responsibility to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains. "
7 nipples on how to get over the hangover after the Weekend party
Some of the toughest sons of men find, after a little party, that whatever the trouble, it helps.
Or according to the statement "avoid hangover, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable postponement and a decent bump for health.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning and get over the hangover as painless as possible after tonight and tomorrow's Weekend rally or other party?
Drink some water.
Alcohol down and down, after a big party in the morning... or even alcohol if possible.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid when it comes to alcohol, it has to be recovered somehow.
Mineral substances are also washed out of the body with water, so it is good to drink mineral water.
As the stomach is often irritated after drinking, it is especially good to have a bubble-free or slightly aerated product.
Go for a walk.
Surely a hangover would not be worth going to Grandma's house to break trees - that could prove to be a fatal false decision.
But a light walk helps the body remember again what it's like to be alive.
Lying in a tent and handing out a hangover is a more time-consuming way of getting healthy.
Give the body power back slowly and carefully.
If you're already puking up from last night's overdrinking, you shouldn't be trying to load a big fat steak in your pocket.
For example, start with the fresh juice that contains the fruit sugars to keep your body quiet.
If your health is already suffering around noon, you could try broth, for example.
And a little later, a little bit later.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic releases your body from every last water.
As I said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent a hangover in the evening, your liver will have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and will lose performance.
So you ruin your liver even more, and then the hangovers will be worse.
In addition, the painkiller will not last very long in the body anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it on an empty stomach - it irritates your already ragged stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, get along with yourself.
It's kind of like walking, but you can't have an orgasm walking.
However, avoid too active pace and crazy poses - during hangover, physical effort should be moderate.
Make a joke.
Make a fool of your friends and fellow-sufferers, make simple fools of yourself, and laugh amicably at yourself and others (suffering).
A joke and a laugh may not drive the hangover away, but they certainly make the aftereffects more fun to bear.
Once a hangover goes over anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee sought as suspects in murder
Police say a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee are being sought nationwide, having become suspects after finding the body of a man with deadly stab wounds in one of Chicago's luxury apartments.
According to Cook County court documents, arrest warrants were issued on Monday without bail for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathemi and 56-year-old Andrew Warren, accused of first-degree murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after a repeated stabbing.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
Police officers received a phone call and, upon arrival at the Grand Plaza apartment building, found a victim with multiple stab wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was admitted to death on the scene and investigators are handling the stabbing as a murder, while police are actively searching for the two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
The university's vice president of public relations, Alan K. Cubbage, said in a statement sent as an email that Lathem is now temporarily suspended from work and is prohibited from entering campuses at Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant at Oxford University's financial department.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in a statement transmitted as an email: "We have been in touch with British police and ready to assist US investigative bodies in any way possible."
In addition, the statement said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wish he would hand himself out.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of communications at the Chicago Police Department, urges suspects to turn themselves in to the authorities.
"The police have a sense of where they are staying, but we are dealing with defining the exact location more and more intensively," Guglielmi said.
According to guglielm, both local, regional and national authorities are helping to search for suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic tip that something had taken place in apartment No 1008.
According to police descriptions, it was a hideous sight.
According to guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said security cameras confirm the presence of Lathemi and Warren in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
The Grand Plaza's management team sent a letter to residents: "Police are currently working to identify the chronology of events and the background of the victim and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that the act was a family suit."
Start-ups that help your business avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees at her e-commerce startup, but the polls were lucrative.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"The system just wasn't consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs an e-commerce company called Madison Reed, which sells hair care products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called on the outside to help.
Emerging are new types of human resources start-ups that help companies figure out what their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee involvement, they allow companies to conduct spot-on surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hot line for complaints, and in some cases allow language carriers to bypass C level managers and contact the board directly.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City's flagship firm Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
According to Errett, in the three years he has been using Glint, he has received a much better understanding of what his staff think and feel.
In addition to the surveys aimed at sudden surgeries and specific teams, it offers a company heat map that provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing it to figure out the reasons.
Businesses have begun to realise they need to stay up to date with their work culture in order not to become the next Uber, which has been wrapped up in scandals since the former worker published a blog post describing a harrowing environment in which those who dared to take the floor were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
The global management, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to data from financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a start-up company operating in Denver Colorado that helps companies prevent and identify inappropriate behavior, noted interest and activity growth against the background of Uber's dubious reputation this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, among them Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent lets companies send custom impulse surveys, collect real-time confidential answers, and view heat maps from troubled areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
And as far as the CEO is concerned, the complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has been anointed by regulators," said Convercent founder and chief executive Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, the company could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, workers "departure and lawsuits, even if regulators don't intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain that has more than 25,000 employees at 500 sites, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of rules and actions and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporation's headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find the phone number or email address of the corporation's headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope it would be taken seriously.
It was often a discouraging and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, however, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices that did not previously reach executives operating in offices in other cities or states can be identified more quickly and dealt with.
"I can get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of employees," said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said companies began to take ethical behavior, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, perhaps after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But only after "social media became ripe" did businesses realise they could not prevent their dirty laundry from washing publicly online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking periodic fees from companies to use their products.
It's a business model and opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supportive of both start-ups.
Convercent was funded in February by $10 million by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thereby raising the value of the capital raised to $47 million.
Glint invested $10 million in November with Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments do not come as a surprise given the interconnection between companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are mere bets on the table.
Employees want to feel they are accepted and valued, and that they dedicate their time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy in the company, feel they are being listened to and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the company's success," said Nina McQueen, vice president of the general benefit and employee experience department at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors generate revenue when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they find support.
Having data on employee involvement is important, according to industry experts.
But this data is useless if the company's supervisors do nothing about it.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can generate expectations for the changes ahead.
And if the changes don't happen quickly enough or not at all, it can lead to frustration and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be ready for 4,000 conversations," said consulting and business management company Kotter International president Russell Raath, who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things aren't brought to an end, the staff will think," Did you actually take me to hear?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care? ""
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now conducts research once a month among staff, has been able to implement the measures on the same day the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from disappointed employees in the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with the problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, is gathering new data on workers and it is hoped that in the long run it will lead to a longer-term commitment of workers in an industry known for its large workforce flow.
"If you're not committed to ensuring transparency, you lose people," Vitrano said.
"And when you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses. "
The eurozone's shining star is the Baltics: incomes are growing fast
While the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are fast approaching the incomes of Western Europe's rich lands, Bloomberg writes in reference to a report by the European Central Bank.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, gross economic output per person in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
The success is driven by a low debt burden, fast-improving institutions and a business and free-market policy.
"The Baltic states in one with Slovakia are among the few eurozone countries where real GDP per person from purchasing power has substantially approached the EU average," the central bank reported.
Although the aim is to equate the total economic output per capita with the richest Western Europe, in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was only 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries belonging to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle.
Low wages have led the Baltics to seek better wages from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light, and the economy is also growing this year, local residents are not at all enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvian and Lithuanian residents estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
The Czech Republic and Poland thought this about their economies slightly less than half of those questioned.
NCAA decision to cancel twice-a-day workouts makes Bruins' days long
It's almost 23 a.m. when a troop of UCLA football players stops to chat at the edge of a new practice field on the team's campus.
Some of them have peeled off their shirt, revealing a sweaty back from their training camp's first-day efforts.
For much of the team, these idle minutes offer a midday break.
Players attending summer courses head back to the dorm home for final exams after a three-hour workout, before returning to the Wasserman Football Centre for meetings at 6.30 am the next morning.
"The next three days will be a real ordeal for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel workouts that take place twice a day to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer - at least until the final exams are completed on Friday.
For that reason, UCLA's first three workouts were scheduled to begin at 19.15 to fit into the players "already tight schedule.
The transition from two workouts a day means more single-workout days - the start of the Bruins' training camp lifted almost a week's worth of forwards compared to last season and, for the first time in Mora's six Westwood seasons, the workouts take place during summer courses.
They are scheduled to have 18 workouts until August 20 before starting official preparation for the September opening game against Texas A & M.
According to Mora, he is in favor of an NCAA rule change, though it adds another agenda point to the players "tight schedules.
"They have an enormous burden on them on three or four days and it's a serious challenge," Mora said.
"And they break through this ordeal; they make an effort, they are fine young.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it will be really good. "
Once the camp is complete, UCLA's workouts will be closed, which, however, is not an easy task given the clear view of their fields from the nearby parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a senior hotel that has already been hit by footballs past the protective net surrounding the goalpost.
Since this weekend, the hotel's Bruins players will be trialling, but Mora admitted problems could arise with vacant rooms during the season.
"We are implementing security measures," Mora said.
"It's a real worry, and it's not exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film training from there.
If you have footage of training, a pretty good deal can be done with it.
But we use a security team there and 8 th parking lot.
We'll do our best using what we already have.
I'm trying not to worry about it.
We have a plan in place. "
In retaliation to the election union of Savisaar-Ivanova, Kristiina Ojuland, exiled from the Reform Party, and the ousted Maria Kaljuste, created by the merger of forces from the Central Bank, our Tallinn and the election union of businessmen to the parties, Tegus Tallinn - it seems that the election alliances created on the initiative of the recipients in party politics will take part in local elections this year at least as much as the political parties.
However, chicks will be counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who will stay with Savisaar?
How small the support of Edgar Savisaar has diminished, one can guess at events organised in honor of his election union.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current central political parties, and many unknown faces - is that what the composition of the electoral union should be?
And can the reason why some faithful supporters and friends of Savisaar are circumventing their candidacy in Tallinn be sought from the fact that the "Savisaar list" of businessmen, led by corruption and suspected of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the town hall for a Russian-language pop song attended by an elder from the town of Lasnamäe; and an original computer game in every sense, in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must, while riding on a bike, avoid the puddles and squirrels that have come into the road - is this how the Center Party seeks the votes of 16 - and 17-year-old voters promised to the ballot boxes for the first time?
We are waiting to see what the other parties' perception of the youth election campaign is.
If, from the beginning of August, the Channel 2 or TV3 viewer receives a black square instead of an entertainment programme, there are two options: to accept that only ETV, ETV2, ETV +, Tallinn TV and English France24 channels will be seen in the free movement from now on, or to give ten to a TV operator each month.
There are probably those who are openly cheering on the advertising-free TV experience at first, but ultimately - though reluctantly - pay for TV pictures and advertisements.
Deafening music, noisy crowds and trash left on the streets are the unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don't want to be a part of the melody, it's a good idea to go home and find a place to sleep, instead of hurting your head, and leave it to the festival guests for a hefty sum.
Washington changes green card rules
Media outlets are quoting President Donald Trump, who they say is planning a new U.S. immigration plan that will change the rules on the green card.
The plan envisages reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people a year, stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and the president supports them.
The bill will go to two chambers of Congress for discussion.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money as it changes the way the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law reduces chain migration and starts to replace the current program.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the funds to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, according to media outlets in the United States.
Siberian seto young people move to the city, pensioners back to the country.
Yevsejevi Anatoli continues the tradition of the once-famous seto gold miners on the edge of the Maana River.
He works 140 kilometres from his home in Kuvai, an auxiliary river in Maana, as a driver of a courier.
It's tough work: two months in a row without holidays for 12 hours of work and then only ten days at home and back again.
Anatoli has only seen gold once in the three years he has worked at the Artel.
"There's a hard time: going in will be thoroughly checked not to bring the vodka, and going out, not to bring the gold," says Anatoli.
Mare Piho chatting with local seto Jaan in the village of Haida, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The archaic culture still preserved in Siberian setos is also beginning to affect the home setos, because it's just so stunning, thinks Piho Mare, who has studied the distant setos most thoroughly.
From his first research trip to Siberia, this year 30 years will pass.
During that time he has been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many sediments did it take to migrate out to Siberia in the late 19 th century and early 20 th century to get land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I say 8000.
I calculated it from the stories of Siberian seto men who have thought about it themselves.
Exactly, it's hard to say because at the time, up to 30 people could have come in one group, but the passport was only given to the man.
The passport was given only to one, but she had children, sisters, and other female relatives.
Look at the size of the territory here!
It was several times the size of the historic Setomaa.
It needed to be educated, managed in some way.
Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (log-tanning), gold mines, industry.
In New Petser, for example, many setos later went to work in the classified city of Krasnojarsk-45 (there was built by the Soviet power of the uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did setos form a majority of the population in this area at the time?
Yes, they lived in a compact.
In addition, there was a long tradition of marriage and multiculturalism.
Seven or eight children in the family was common.
How many Siberian setos differed and different from native setos?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of money ideas.
They made their own (money ideas) then, but they always made a difference between what had been brought and what had been done here.
Climate change strongly influenced the traditional dressing of setos, because it is colder here.
Food changed.
In Setomaa, for example, the meat was salted, but here it was simply frozen.
Where are the Siberian setos villages and what life is living there?/graphic: Alari Paluots
The connection to motherland was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is going to give back there, start influencing them.
These girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho means the people of the Estonian setos delegation who came to the Haida village at the beginning of July to the day of the Seto kingdom and lived for four days in homes - J. P.
What's left here, it's amazing.
"It's super easy to come to the slaughter and go away too, because the city has an excellent location: at the railway junction and at the intersection of the roads," says Reigo Tamm, an opera isolist from Tapa.
The city is no longer a mere military capital, we have many places of nature, sports and culture, and pizza is available at every corner.
Kill is a top-topping town!
There's a small island on the White River running through town, where the Pillans tend to have a party.
"This beautiful place doesn't look like a train window," says Reigo.
Anyone who isn't afraid of cold water can swim in that river because the river is full of sources.
I've been out there swimming, I can do it!
You can have a picnic on the river and just romance - you can look at the flow of the river and think about life in front and behind.
I've been out there walking with my girlfriends.
Tamm, the opera-insulator, has been on the river bank among the three bridges practising his own aria site: "Because this place is on the side of the city, no one can come back when I hump my own stories."
"There is a wonderful view of Tapa from the pine mountain, but there are also health pathways where you can run, ski in winter, and play discgolds now - golf course is done, discs can be borrowed from a sports centre," Reigo points out.
The old pros go there, of course, with their discs, but I haven't got there yet to play.
I think we should invite our colleague, Rasmus Kull, to visit Tapa, because he is an experienced discgolfer and has the discs.
Maybe he'll lend me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable from the childhood times of the current opera olith.
At least during ski lessons.
There are many tears and disappointments left on this mountain, and you will be in my sporting life.
Not to mention broken sledges and mouthpieces.
"The entire city centre is currently full of construction works, all of which is changing to the unknown," Reigo praises.
Kill the old and tired vexal building, however, is a very attractive place to play summer reconnaissance.
I am pleased that in 2012, the head of R.A.A.M, Märt Meos, accepted my idea and came to the quaint summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theatrical season with "Alexei Karenin" was just over, on August 11 th there will be a "Wake-up of Life" at the railway station, when the old copper building is moving around in the 1980 s.
"Between 11 and 13 August, the days of the city of Tapa, in which the open cafes of the copper building have awakened and a series of cultural events are taking place, including the public hall," says Reigo, who recommends a 91-year-old visit to the city in those days.
In a tiny yellow cottage on the May 1 st Boulevard, the museum has been in place since 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are well many and information immensely," praises Reigo's place, which is full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on rail and warfare.
Reigo grins that when Tapa goes through all the suggested places, her stomach goes dry for a long time, but luckily the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good dining places and sitting in cafes sometimes feels like you're abroad," he describes.
The educated and young soldiers who have come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so sitting there is a gloomy feeling that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but there is such an international society all around.
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we have a lot of movement!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
TV channel bTV quoted the Foreign Office as reporting that two Bulgarians were taken into custody for illegal camping in Greece.
Police arrested a group of illegally camped people on the Sithonian Peninsula on the morning of August 1, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but there's an investigation going on.
The foreign ministry told TV channel bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already imposing harsh fines on anyone caught by resting in a place which is not intended for that purpose.
Checks continue throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court can impose a fine.
Puppies are taught by wolves to break sheep.
The farmers of Hiiumaa have to give the wolves the "educational material" from their pack after a year's break - the wolves, apparently teaching the puppies, have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep on three occasions, with a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the corresponding number was just three, 124 a year earlier.
The environmental agency also records that the wolf litter was not born last year in Hiiumaa and that the Hiiumaa hunting council was informed that two wolf litter sites were fixed on the island this year.
On the night of Monday, the wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in the Emmaste municipality and injured half of the 18 surviving sheep.
Early on Wednesday morning, wolves in the pasture of the village of Reheselja broke one sheep and severely injured another, who had to be given a distress call.
Rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft Law on the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOVS) and amending the Plant Protection Act to the coordination ring.
The amendment to the Act waives the creation of a separate dataset for both genetically modified (GM) crop locations and operators, using the plant health register in the future.
In addition, the obligation of the GM crop operator to have a prior agreement with the beekeeping person within the prescribed radius is amended.
Although genetically modified crops are not currently grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for coexistence of genetically modified and non-modified crops.
This at least until there is no decision to declare Estonia GMO-free," said Sigmar Suu, head of the plant health department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors," Suu added.
The draft law repeals the provisions related to GM crop locations and handlers' data collection and handling training in GMOVS, establishes requirements for GM crop handling and business start-up.
Specifically in relation to beekeeping, the current obligation of the GM crop grower to inform beekeepers of the start-up of the GM crop is replaced by an obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with beekeeping prior to the start of cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult it in the draft information system and, if desired, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The proposed changes will affect, in particular, those active in the field of plant production, beekeepers and the Agriculture Authority.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop is allowed to grow - maize MON 810.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing a GM crop.
This is due to the fact that there is no corn pest in Estonia, a European varrelay agent that is resistant to maize line MON 810.
Also, varieties of this corn line have been bred to southern regions and this May is not suitable for our climate conditions.
To get certainty from the above, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has ordered studies in 2015 and 2016 on the detection of possible GM organisms pollution in seeds of the various kinds of souviraps, corn and soya grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and the study concluded that seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that genetically modified crops are not knowingly grown in Estonia and that there has also been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruit Nemanja Matic as' genius'
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited a "genius" in the face of Nemanja Matic after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
A player overbought from Chelsea for £40 million started in Dublin in Unite's last pre-season game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid in the starting line-up for a 2-1 victory on Tuesday, impressed in the defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were able to walk free on offensive pitches.
But having stayed away from the Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Matic missed a badly needed matchup form and held on for only 45 minutes. This has to be improved from a certain point before the start of the Premier League season, according to Mourinho.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, an ingenious way of thinking - he has the mindset of football," Mourinho said.
"Let's help him achieve form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, the other new recruits Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the starting lineup at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho began quietly putting his eleven starting men in place for the start of the season.
The Independent disclosed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three football players, but he confirmed the club has already done away with an "excellent job" by signing contracts with three of his four priority options.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another bowler got a GSM transmitter on his leg on August 1 and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinsson, the bird-watcher in the ring, the first son of a bitch with a chaperone, and this litter is already flying around, leaving the baseball and joining the great pool of nights in Mullutu-Gogland.
That's because there's no orchard in Hell, says the Saar Voice.
This Tuesday, relatively late in the day to ring the lines, another curler was attached to the transmitter, and this on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of the transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a cub named Mati was equipped with a GSM transmitter on the Sõrves Türjul.
"His activities are all viewable on the internet: how he wintered in Spain, toppled the German-Polish border a long time ago, and then came to Saaremaa," Martinsson said.
The British inventor had a microchip installed in his body to get into the house and car by hand.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so that he could simply open his front door with a hand gesture, get into the office and even start a car.
33-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip installed between his thumb and forefinger and now offers this service through his company BioTeq also to companies and private individuals looking to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with consultant-anaesthesiologist Dr Geoff Watson of the Hampshire County Royal Hospital in Winchester to ensure the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip to be installed in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes just 30 seconds.
The Northam company will also swap the locks for houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, asking for £300 for one lock.
This married one-child father has installed the technology now both at home and in his car the BMW Z4, which launches when his hand is on the steering wheel.
White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands
According to military documents disclosed to TIME, the White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter last month to the southern court for an event celebrating American production cost taxpayers almost $24,000.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One during the president's onboard appearance, was the central draw number for the event introducing American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials in the White House were news outlets on their tour of industrial products from all 50 states.
A helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a fork lift truck made in Mississippi.
According to documents from the squadron Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), which is responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House's military office demanded a helicopter presence with the FARGO barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the southern court for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually high-attention event," the HMX-1 commander said a day before the event in an email to his supervisor, the deputy chief officer of the Navy in the field of aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at the southern yard on the morning of July 17 at about 15 o'clock in the morning of July 17 and remain there until the yard was cleared between 18 and 21 that evening.
Added to that was the fact that if leaving the White House were to be delayed, a second ejection would be needed for the return flight due to work-time restrictions.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the squadron security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to read out the documents given to TIME whether or not another ejaculation was eventually needed.
Hatch's law prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 was investigating whether this event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it violated the Hatch Act, and we were told not to violate," the commander wrote.
"You seem to have no choice," the deputy chief executive officer replied.
The White House declared the event "made in America" an official event, and Hatch's law would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
At the event, the President supported the healthcare reform efforts that had been discussed in the Senate at the time and praised the efforts to contain government regulations.
Using an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically lucrative purposes is no new phenomenon.
Presidents need to use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them for a purely photo session is unusual.
Trump came under attention in February when a presidential plane rolled into the background at his first campaign event in Florida in Melbourne, and his Twitter account is teeming with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the display "made in America," where products from all 50 states manufactured by American workers from American materials were represented," said White House press compliance Lindsay Walters.
Hmx-1 teams often make rehearsal flights around Washington and on the southern court to rehearse the fall-out to the White House of the President of the United States with centimetre accuracy.
While Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 trial landings in the courtyard of the White House.
According to the official, the flight to the event "made in America" was considered to be the standard of flight instruction for that month.
The squadron helicopters flew another 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
According to the White House, none of the other exponents of the event were burdened with the taxpayer's purse.
According to a spokesman for Sikorsky, the company was not involved in arranging an exhibit on the helicopter's southern yard.
Hmx-1 does not keep budget records for the president's flights, and the exact costs of the event are hard to figure out.
But according to the Defense Department's 2017 fiscal year hourly prices, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
In the records of the escort, the length of the flight from its main base, Navy Quantico Airport, Virginia, was marked for 30 minutes in both directions.
The White House claims the actual cost of using a helicopter is well below that amount.
"The calculation of taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated compensation rates include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs to be taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the Ministry of Defence's compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
White House former spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the event at the time.
"The point of the matter is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that the states of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security and that there are presumably hundreds, if not even thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe, just like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it's right to highlight it. "
It's not clear whether or not Trump was in contact with a helicopter while circling the south yard, but he was sitting behind the wheel of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump turned to representatives of Sikorsky, casting media outlets as a joke over the company's products in his personal aircraft park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - through tears came peace and joy
In the 2011 World Cup Daegus, Šadeiko was hit in the last area, an 800 m run-off leg rump and a stretcher was taken away from the stadium.
Immediately before that, he had received zero in the distance jump on a Chinese-made universe.
The 2012 Helsinki-EM was ruined by a low-cost injury, but at the London debut Olympics, he scored 6013 points in 23 rd place.
However, the misfortune continued.
In the 2013 Moscow World Cup, the Estonian Estonian record on the schedule became a thumb injury in the distance jump after the opening day.
Two years later, he took 15 th place in the Beijing World Cup and filled the Olympic stage, but it had also been a disappointment for the athlete.
It was only last year that Shadeiko went through the heaviest juncture when she didn't get the result at first in the distance jump in Amsterdam.
I'd just like to put together a good multi-race once.
Once, "said Šadeiko.
Worse still ahead: A month later, his Olympic match broke out in Rio due to a thigh injury already on the first hurdle.
Time had to be taken off - can the seven-match squad continue at all?
Is two days of effort still worth all that?
She thought for a long time, but found peace in herself.
I got to clean my head.
It's relatively difficult to describe the experience, but I've been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Luckily, there was time to heal himself and think his head clean.
"I knew I wouldn't put the pills in my bag yet," Shadeiko says of her self-cleaning.
I was able to turn the clean sheet and move on with a new blow.
Coach Anne Mägi said it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the ward, but she realized that, above all, the athlete had to figure out himself.
He was so torn down by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said he wouldn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth," says Mägi.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He does it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the Götzis multi-race.
In a high-profile contest, he improved his personal brand of excellence by nearly a metre (13.89) and ran in a near-record time barrier run.
Then the multi-contestant felt that it was not a ceiling of power at all, but that it was only a primary race hunger that had been extinguished.
After years of guidance, the Mountain says that Schadeiko is a black student.
He's ready for athletics, he's good to train.
If anything does trouble or is wrong, he will say it immediately.
He knows his body and trusts his sense.
That's what we need to start with.
I can't tell you exactly what to do, and we'll follow it.
A new approach has also been found by Šadeiko.
"I'm not the one doing the best in practice," he says, and says that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also provides a good result.
The happiness of the loved ones makes you happy.
Good emotions have also been offered to Šadeiko by the happiness of the loved ones.
Both his former training partner Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-contestant has received support from new weather citizens.
"Quite interesting," says Šadeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking equates to "training" the brain.
Livesttrain says that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that he believes that a brain can be trained with wine better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but about the "very active" process of tasting wine.
By sniffing the glass, twisting the wine in the mouth, enjoying it and sensing the aftertaste, we put our brain to work to create a taste for the wine.
According to Shepert, wine molecules don't actually contain taste, but taste arises from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He brings comparison to how the brain "sees" colors.
"Taste isn't in wine, taste creates a tasty of wine," says Sheperd.
The things that still affect the appearance of wine taste are, for example, our age, gender and even the amount of saliva that a person produces.
Sheperd says, of course, that the wine is not to be drunk.
"There has to be more to be done," he says.
If you take too big a sip, the system is oversaturated.
Excessive wine drinking can harm the brain instead of benefit - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine are risking losing memory, losing balance and reduced mental capacity.
10% of Estonian ICT sector employees receive less pay from colleagues
Data from human resources search firm Fontes reveals that 10 percent of Estonian ICT sector employees receive less pay from colleagues.
The ten percent pay gap is between men and women, writes portal Geenius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in Fontes' ICT sector pay survey.
A total of 8,577 posts were surveyed.
63% of the posts were employed by men.
"Although only 3 companies indicated that the pay gap is for the benefit of men and the rest of the companies considered that there is no pay gap, in reality compared to similar jobs, men's monthly basic pay is on average 10% higher than that of women and men's annual gross wages are on average 8% higher than that of women," said Fontes analyst Ilmar Põhjala.
Promotional clip for Season 3 of "narcos": Now that Pablo Escobar is gone, the Cali cartel will take center stage in the Netflix hit series
Despite being revealed as the killer of Pablo Escobar in the second season of "Narcos," the Netflix series is far from finished.
The third and fourth seasons have been approved by the streaming service, and the first one has already received a promotional clip teasing the series with new malcontents.
In the third season, the DEA turns its attention to the world's wealthiest drug-dealing organization - the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers "like a Fortune 500 company," simply with more bribery to the government and more violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) runs a communication with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a freshly released promotional clip, Pedro Pascal is seen returning as Javier Penana, a character who recruits American and Colombian law enforcement to help in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "narcos" will get an opening bout on September 1.
According to the UN, the democracy of Afghans depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the U.N. Afghanistan mission said Wednesday that elections can only represent the nation if all members of the community, including women, play a role in them.
The head of the U.N. Assistance Mission, Nicholas Haysom, said hundreds of women are running for local council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of recently registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate the significance of the role of women," she said in a statement made on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the nation and only be credible when women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The elections and presidential elections for local councils in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban, for its part, have threatened the electoral process, which coincides with a transition period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is calmly handed over from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million women have registered from 3.6 million registered voters.
The joy of sharing makes every thing more acute, both large and small.
There's always too little time in common, but a workout with bladders provides a good opportunity to combine being together, game, closeness and exercise.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you cruise in the summer, you'll always have live hantels with you, and with your thin voice, you'll remember impatiently, "Let's work out, too!"
Start with a warm-up - very good is a regular gold game or a run down the beach strip.
The plough is the foundation of feet and buttocks - so who would want to take the shape of a sand cake washed from the waves during the summer?
It's wonderful to use kids instead of sticks!
First of all, it is secure and comfortable, the weight is slowly growing at the same rate as the workout force.
Advanced ones can also do squats with real big kids.
A child exercises balance, counts repetitions and feels fun at the opportunity to high tendon and important.
The bigger kids can make their own squats at the same time.
The extent of the movement is determined by touching the earth and reaching up your arms.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the mini-helper to hold on properly.
A child can read repeats and feel like a coach.
Plank is super useful but hopelessly boring exercise for the child.
But it's easy to make things more fun!
Game-plank: Take a long column of plangs to drill through at times.
Actually harder than usual, but much more fun to do than in the meantime you can give a friend a hand.
To add a load, you can stay in a plank, with a small back, and walk around in that position.
For extra weight, a smaller child can be seated on the hips, but this exercise provides fun for all children.
While crabs onion on the sand, triceps, ash and abdominal muscles get a load like an infection.
The child descends on his feet so that his body weight is equally distributed front and back.
You can hold hands for security.
Curl your legs and reach straight up.
The kid can fly, have fun, train his balance, and be difficult.
The life of the little coach is extravagant when he gets a little kiss every time he comes across.
The extra load is given by feet stretching forward.
Check that the back is in neutral position.
The kids themselves have a lot more fun doing abdominal muscles in pairs and claps.
Handiwork and a cookie with a pulse.

All the children's favourite and great fun!
A truly effective whole-body workout for an older person.

From the Philippines to the heart of the world, or the Silver Bag trip to the heart of fashion fans
The straw bags are summer classics, which have become a single hit product in recent years, and which one right summer salesman has to hang by his hand, and which, despite its modest origins, merchants have been able to weld up a price tag for a hit.
A straw-braided bag is probably one of the things that has existed every single time in life and the possession of which has not produced any particular emotion.
It just exists and if it doesn't, then nothing is broken either.
Now, however, shoulder bags are making a real winning move, and fashion fans have swapped their fine designer bags for the summer months for plain straw-braided bags.
Not only is it a beach bag, but today it is as popular as a street bag, and the bolder women even walk into the office.
Here, however, it is worth clarifying before you know whether a summer look like that for your boss is still sitting, or whether it is worth pushing a wet notebook and laptop up to a more formal amount.
But the change in the shoulder bags has made the women a real summer love.
For example, when you read foreign fashion blogs, the first thing you can see is that fashion tournaments take a holiday trip to the local market and buy themselves some straw bags, which are then faithful to the rest of the holiday period, and which come with them on the beach, on the market, and also with their friends hanging out on the town.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy more bags from the market and sell or give them to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that there is so much demand for bags among readers that in the real world women (and men!) would probably go arm-in-arm with each other in order to become the lucky owner of a bag.
In some ways, this madness is understandable, because it is rare to buy a few things in the fashion world for a few hundred euros.
Indeed, clever merchants have also discovered a simple money-making option here, and so the finer luxury brands also sell beer bags for a few hundred and - a thousand euros.
Probably just so the richer customers don't have to feel like mere mortals who prowl around with some cheap bags.
For example, Dolce & Gabbana can buy a straw bag worth over a thousand euros.
For the interpretation of Chanel's straw bag, however, it can be estimated at €6,000.
Unlike most fashion builders, however, the straw bags were not from a few large fashion boxes, but their story began far away.
It is claimed that the straw bags come from far away from the Philippines, where they have been carried in broad weather.
It is primarily the export business, and the locals are very often not seen walking around with them.
It is alleged that the straw-making technique originated in the 14 th century and is quite sarcastic with the usual basket-making.
However, since a straw bag does not have to be so badly blotted as a basket, it is possible to incorporate patterns and other materials that make the bag more personalized and accentuated by it.
There are, for example, particularly trendy bags lately, where coloured bands or leather strips have been blended in.
In particular, the straw bags may send a thank-you note to the actress Jane Birkin, of whom the biggest bloated straw-bag fan had never been seen before.
She matched her shoulder bag with all sorts of outfits and didn't even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
The popularity of bags today does not play a smaller role, but it is also that the care of them is a figurehead and, unlike all the other sumadans, they do not have to be cared for by special means, but also by water and wet towels.
As with trend initiatives, other than classic looks, brands come up with all sorts of interpretations.
For example, you might want to buy a shoulder-braided strand or a small shoulder bag.
At the same time, it's worth remembering that a classic straw bag never goes out of fashion, but a straw coat does.
But what is the classic straw bag?
For centuries, a straw-braided bag that resembles a basket of its own style has been regarded as classic, and has been open and short, as well as straw, handles.

GMB worries about investment in company McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union is awaiting confirmation from cookie manufacturer McVitie's executives about long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent on the future of the Tollcrosses object investment.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
The company's McVitie's owner Pladis said they had invested more than £5 m in the object over the past few years.
More workers were hired there and the union chairmen "will be the first to hear" if anything changes in the factory's operations.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland addressed McVitie's request to "address concerns that the funding will not be used to modernise production lines."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we are not getting clarity from the object's head manager on Tollcrosses' business needs and future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow, being an essential pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
So in terms of jobs, wages and well-being in the eastern part of Glasgow, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic decline in production, it needs a rapidly growing company in McVitie. "
A spokesman for the plaque said: "The Tollcrosses object manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will respond directly to him as we value active communication with workers and union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting was held in Tollcrosses between staff and representatives of GMB, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We then discussed with employees that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and precarious economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years we have invested over £5 million in the Tollcrosses object, most of it has gone to production lines and improvements in operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcrosses as a production object, and should any changes be made to the object's activities, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it. "
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about an approach to Neymar?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on attempts to lure Neymar into their ranks by making an offer of £189 million to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record-breaking conquest trip?
That tumultuous approach has opened a summer transition window, and the Ligue 1 club are set to smash more than double the overbuying current world record set last season by the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United for £89 million.
Once the transition is complete, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, starting to receive a salary of more than £500,000 a week from PSG after payment.
Barcelona are, of course, angry about both the way of approach and breaking Neymar free, although a source close to the Catalans board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed an interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi harshly warned all clubs thinking about recruiting some of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will face them and contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they are trying to enter into a contract with some of our players, they must face the consequences. "
Barcelona appear to have overstepped that border as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in PSG midfield player Marco Verratt.
PSG made it clear that they would not let the Italian leave on any condition and that Barcelona could get a rebound as a result of that interest, losing one of their expensive assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brexit is seriously threatening to strike a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned on a first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made possible the current free movement of people and goods, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders," he stressed.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and as it cannot, to remain part of the European common market.
It would maintain the current free trade between the Irish Republic and the UK.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the UK, the Irish prime minister explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "Certainly we could have one with Britain."
An alternative to that would be a return to customs posts declaring a historic split and political failure.
"A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "a challenge for our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Irish daily life.
The Irish prime minister met with leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland during a visit to Belfast.
Märt Avandi, through his first half-long triathlon: Ironman can be passed by anyone.
Today, in the winter capital, Otepääl was held the Baltic's largest triathlon festival, when the half-long Ironman race was held in about a thousand triathletes from more than thirty countries.
The 70.3-mile distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of bike ride and 21.1 km of bike ride.
Among others, the first triathlon of his life was also ended triumphantly by Märt Avandi.
"I thought it would be difficult, and it was difficult at last," said Avand in the finish.
Despite the complexity, Avandi found that, in fact, triathlon is a viable head for all.
"Not a distance kills, but a pace kills," he said, implying that almost anyone can reach the finish line at an appropriate pace.
Except Ott Sepp: "Ot's physique is fine, but he can't swim."
Avandi had been working hard since February.
First 4-5 hours a week, then ten hours a week.
With 05:34:12 he reached 270 th place in the overall count.
Although Avandi lost to both Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called "prominents class" contestants.
Tanel Padar, who had been "a good role model persone" last year, lost to Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18 respectively).
The overall winner of the men's records of the Ote<unk> stage in the ironman series was crowned the German Johannes Moldan with 3:58:27 left, the Estonians had the best Ivo Suur with 04:14:09 left.
Among the women, the Danish Helle Frederiksen triumphed with 04:24:01, while the Estonians Maria Jänese, who lost to Frederiksen in nearly half an hour, and by 04:58:58.
The avant underwent a 1.9 km swim distance with 42 minutes and 14 seconds left.
Out of the water, he came in 410 th position.
