Despite the title, dive Anne-Marie O'connor's "the Lady in gold. Gustav klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-bauer's portrait of an extraordinary story of" one work of art sünniloo much deeper 19. century and 20. century Viennese cultural life.
However, further in-depth into the history.
Aukartustäratav to infohulgale costs have the advantage of perhaps harder kärpekirve, the narrower the topic the children have been in the title, the authorized portrait of the extraordinary the same stories in more pronounced.
Currently would be the ones on the cover between sort of two books: Gustav Klimt and his painting of "the Lady in gold" depicts Adele Bloch-bauer's story, and a much more extensive and comprehensive ajalooraamat dear juudiperekondades and the German occupation with its effects in Austria.
A book for the first third of the way in the middle of the vibrant Viennese cultural life, and who own the capital of Austria in distress, may the slightest effort to imagine how more than a hundred years ago life Ringstrasse near the course, or how Central the coffee shop all have to pay, if Klimt stepped on.
Cultural figures of concentration was European in one of the richest towns in the high and in the book a familiar name for you feel to own any sort of grammike of cultural more.
In the same example, the fact that Sigmund Freud operates in the city, where the growth of incurable syphilis and had the highest suicide level, the story of development as if anything at do not give.
Or perhaps, however, - also each paarilauseline brush stroke adds color 20. century culture from Vienna.
A dream trip to the Soviet Union
19. century in recent decades was the jewish number of Vienna exploded, becoming the largest jewish community in Western Europe.
The turn of the century was the need of every ten in the Vienna resident jew.
Also Adele parents were in Vienna newcomers, but by the time Adele got married a two time open Czech suhkrumagnaadi Ferdinand Bloch and Klimtile his famous paintings for posing, was his father, the bank received already the second largest the seventh bank to the habsburg empire by the.
But Adelet this whole glamorous life, where he belonged, not attracted.
Where to watch "Lady in gold", it is hard to believe that life towards the end of the infects of this stately lady socialist and a dream trip to the Soviet Union.
1903. years, when Ferdinand Bloch decided her husband's portrait to order Klimtil, was the last moments of the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt, the order of payment in at that time, 4000 eek, a quarter of the good location of the country house prices from.
This, to some of the portrait in the case of suspected champion of having an affair with a model, suhkrumagnaati not discouraged.
That Adeles concerned, then the only sure fact is that the work generated during the model and the artist's close relationship continued to the end of his life.
Anne-Marie O'connor - "the Lady in gold.
Gustav klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-bauer's portrait of an extraordinary story", Vintage 2016, English translation by Aldo Randma.
Immediately before work commences, Adelega was Klimt visited Ravennas San Vitale order, and investigators think that just there for the glorious mosaics of the empress Theodorast gave the artist the idea to make the golden portrait Adelest painted as a mosaic.
Klimt presents his "Lady in gold" in Vienna in 1908. year and about the same time (in the years 1907-1908) was born in the other a golden painting "the Kiss".
Kunstiajaloolastel is left with two women in a similar not to go unnoticed.
How is the story related to Hitler?
"I think that your friend Klimt mäletuseks am I owed him, to do his handiwork available to the public", wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer for a couple of years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) the Belvedere museum director and wished that their family Klimt collection would go to the museum.
Six year before his death was Klimtil made Adelest other portrait.
Also your last will and testament (Adele left in February 1925) he asked, that the spouse would leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscape of the Austrian Gallery.
Your jewelry bequeathed it õetütardele Her and Luisele.
A year after Klimt had finished the "Austrian Mona Lisa", was tried by the Vienna academy of Fine Arts in the escape 17 years old Adolf Hitler, but fell joonistamiseksamil through.
Although sometimes considered to be hitler's subsequent anti-semitism the reason behind this that the jewish professors in academia don't receive, none of his exam in fact, a jew.
Anyway, was Maria's last will and testament referred to the Austrian Gallery to the task in 1939. years has dramatically changed - the key was to become Vienna's rich from jewish collections from the natsiparteile pleasing amazing job of finding.
Hitler's personal kunstivaramusse size were also some Adele at home had a job, but not Klimt.
Sixty years after the nazis kunstirööv became the beginning of a ten-year litigation between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauerite between their heirs.
At this point, be only noted, that when the "Kiss" sees vienna in the Belvedere castle, then Adele Bloch-Bauer represents the "Lady in gold" should look to drive New york's Neue Galeries.
And before the Vienna driving also read the above mentioned book.
Even then, if you Klimt works look to go do not plan, because at least my emotions revolved after the book closure of the more nazi - and juuditeema than 135 million dollar for the sale of the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer around.
Thus not so much a portrait, if rather family saatuselugu - and very touching story.
Greatly facilitates the events-the book starts off the Bauerite pedigree.

The President of the Trump goes on vacation, the critics sharpened their teeth
Holiday time is at hand - this means relaxation also US president Donald Trumpile.
As Trump has, however, been so far one of the most vacation days taken by president, sharpening the critics already teeth.
USA Today and Cnn report that the president of the planned 17-day vacation to spend omanimelise in the golf club Bedminster, which is located in New Jersey.
Although the president's vacation began yesterday, is the springboard of the opponents rest on the floor already weeks.
They complain Trumpile down too often work holidays.
Namely, is the president of the practice to spend the weekend time your in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villa.
By the way, Trump is not your 196 ametipäev within the most rested president.
For example, George W. Bush reached in this time on vacation to be already 67 days, Barack Obama, but by less than a Trump card, in just 21 days.
But tend to Trumpil things quickly forgotten.
A few days after the president of the said Trump card by sending the "60 minutes", that for the long haul vacation for his ametaja within a period of time does not remain, as very much needs to be done.
Also, he published three years ago, the resentment of Barack Obama's vacation over.
The current president wrote at the time, on Twitter: "at This time when Obama is on vacation, plays golf, goes to parties and džässkontserti in, cut the ISIS journalists heads ends".
White House officials indicated that is not a 17-day golf club visit actually kind of relaxing.
It is officially called, instead, tööpuhkuse, during which time no Trumpil time for reading or other meelistegevus for.
In addition to the had to tööpuhkusel be also another reason.
Namely, the swapping of the White House läänetiivas konditsioneerisüsteem out and therefore had all the staff on leave.
Läänetiivas is also located Ovaalkabinet and the other the president of the workspaces.
"I do not believe that anyone else would want in August läänetiivas be, if there are 38 degrees and no air conditioning", said White House spokesperson Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president will continue to vacation at work.
This, where the president of Trump followed by 17 days to spend, you can get an idea of the video.
The criticism of the blocking of Facebook  don't stand in your public work, if you can't tolerate voter criticism
Our country's father knew about the unfavourable media coverage from both a lot.
Americans loved George Washington, but the history of not gone long, that begin in cudgel for everything from domestic policy to the it policy põhimõteteni out.
The criticism naturally upset him.
But he has forced his critics to remain silent.
Because in the year 1783, said in Washington that "freedom of expression may be subject to us taken away, and dumb and silent may our sheep the way to the massacre of the president".
This brings me to the Maryland governor Larry Hogan, who must make the effort to see that be more of the Washington way.
Hogan the subordinates are blocked and deleted at least 450 people posts, who published on her official Facebook page your opinion.
And the week started by the complaint of the American civil liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU) he, therefore, to the court.
The governor officialdom stamped on the action to be void and veebikommentaariumid kubis, vastureaktsioonidest in the style of "Who cares?".
"This is all from Facebook," said many.
But this counts though.
And it counts as much when it comes to such a man as Hogan.
This is an amazingly popular republican governor with an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His heakskiiduprotsent is the country's 50 governors among the runners in second place.
Hogan is not without thinking about responsive tuisupea.
He has led state on a specific hand and left in their principles strictly determine.
In addition, he has been using as the main tool of their choice, interact with quite proficiently on Facebook, in your presentation, such as after chemotherapy the first time the funny way their hairless heads.
Thus, it is the governor's page  which is the official labelling on a public forum, which manages the taxpayers ' dollars of the salary of the personnel  visit of people blocking unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan spokesman Amelia Chasse defended The Washington Post in an interview with the governor's behavior, claiming that the comment block was not anything other than modding.
But it is too easy to paint a picture on the web sõimle from internetitrollid, rämpspostitajatest or hate filled people.
The Post a conversation with several pretty people, which Hogan blocked.
And this is what they are  real people who communicate with their elected leaders. Teacher, business owner and pastor, not internetitrollid.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not at all profane.
The Pastor quoted your post the bible, the emphasis in the hogan the katoliiklusele.
Marylandist Bowie'i.e. from a lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Raman not incited hatred, but a real hate crime.
"Said I politely, that I am disappointed because he has not reacted vihakuritegudele or other recent news," he wrote in The Mail uudisteloo kommentaarirubriigis.
"Also, I don't like the idea that if more people comment on the same subject, referred to some of it now with indifference to the collective effort, rather than admit that this is a large number of concerned citizens."
What the governor officialdom called "targeted rämpspostirünnakuks", called the other probably a "public support".
Facebook-era allows the messages to easily match, blocking the just criticism or deleting negative comments.
Thing is a lot cleaner than in the old days, when the do the same for the income to send out personnel to collect the critical editorial with newspapers together and burn they would, or arrest the protesters and the force they should be silent.
But exactly this is currently happening, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official, who criticise Facebook and other sotsiaalmeediakanal of toothless making after.
The President of the Asset has complained to the court Twitter users, who is he Twitter stream blocked.
One of the first symbolic meaning of the court decisions on this subject were made last week in Virginia.
U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris decided), that loudoun of the county board of supervisors first infringed the constitution of the first correction, when he blocked a voter to their Facebook page.
Kentucky visited the ACLU on Facebook and Twitter use after also governor Matt Bevini (R).
It should not be so hard to be.
Washington at the time was affordable postage in a similar impact as the internet.
The range of 1776 to 1800 quadrupled in the newspapers the number and anonymity of the kirjakirjutajad set of its management mode.
And even then it was Washington anonymous trolls chest poke.
People wrote to newspapers letters such pseudonyms as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Port, made in Washington decisions on the ground.
Web-based George Washington letters in the collection of the project within the framework of the total harvested historical documents in accordance with the burial in the he office of petitions, which criticised the he views in relation to great Britain concluded the treaty of amity, commerce and laevandusleping with.
But he did not forced them to be silent.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate is our country's foundations.
And proper management of the means of its acceptance.

What maailmanurga from estonia to be moved?
Last year in extended and issue a police and border guard board (PPA) to a record of more than 13 000 of the residence permit for third-country nationals, who are predominantly Estonia traveled for work, study or family.
If, for example, last year it was decided the temporary residence permit issued 6702 alien, then tunamullu it was the number 4928.
Authorities did not say how many immigrants eventually to Estonia permanently remain, but this kind of analysis in the ministry of interior shall be drawn up.
If ten years ago moved to Estonia in nearly 500 ukrainians, then in recent years it will be number 2000 close reach.
Residence permit the number of applicants increased by leaps and bounds in Ukraine during the crisis - in 2014. year became the temporary residence permit of the 1087 people, the year before 675.
According to statistics estonia, the same can grow in Estonia, most of Ukraine number of citizens - last year, arrives in Estonia 850 Ukrainian citizens more than the left.
"The Ukrainian community in Estonia, all the time big been and complex due to the circumstances of the country it is natural that the work and learning opportunities in search of the country, where community and many in the family already facing," said interior ministry spokesman Kristin Rammus.
Last year and tunamullu was of a temporary residence permit become ukrainians in the number of higher even Russian citizens number, although ten years is the total of all of the more fixed-term residence permit issued last.
If the ukrainians come here predominantly for work, then the Russian citizens pereränne after.
"Given this historic Russian community, they are likely also the most significant family ties in Russia living people", said Sisekaitseakadeemia rändeteadur Helina Maasing.
"If you look at where the Estonian residence permit to become Russian citizens will have to live to be transplanted, then Harjumaa after is immediately to the East-Virumaa", he added and pointed out that about 40 percent of them are married citizens of the European Union.
Last year it became the temporary residence permit 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the residence permit extended wished russians a number of had decreased.
"Leap is due to the fact that the renewal of the residence permit instead of the requested new residence permanently in Estonia", explains the ministry of the interior spokesman Rammus, who say that the Russian citizens ' interest in the Estonian residence permit remained in rather stable.
The new residence permanently in Estonia to get here for at least three years lived with foreigners the applicant from the previous year.
Its purpose is to encourage adapted people siiajäämise.
Long-term residence permit, however, requires a example, for five years.
The new residence after it is probably reduced also the old residence permit extension.
For example, last year were granted a residence permit 146 ukraine citizen who is here for at least three years working.
Now you can get the ukrainians to work on the exchange and the Estonian state does not time the longer the finger with the sequel, whether palgakriteerium are met.
This residence became a fell swoop popular - applicants last year still grey passport owners (1029), russians (487), indians (54) and nigerians (36).
Total received for settling in Estonia for the purpose of residence in 1968 of people, among them more such as 23 americans, 12 egyptians, 18 georgians and an equal number of chinese.
This year, the first half is of such applicants, the total amount already in 1269.
Ten years is surprisingly, Nigeria received a country, whose citizens are among the more active Estonian residence permit applicants.
If the 2007. in the same issue of nigeria on three of the residence permit, then the last 200.
Nigeria should be here in the universities to learn.
Yet is the Estonian higher education institutions are popular, for example, georgians, chinese, and turks among them.
India, Bangladesh and Nigeria the number of citizens has risen predominantly due to the õpperände.
Also they are subject to the rule, that where there is a community for encountered, there must be a easier another," added Rich.
Ten years, two people in Estonia moved also, for example, from North Korea, much the same as from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people are coming here from Cuba, 231 South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If the year can be the residence about 6,000 third-country citizens, then it is about 0,46% of the total population.
Even if you think the roots of the citizens of the European Union, remains to be the migration about the percentage of roots", commented Maasing, that in fact, the figures are small.
Total migration according to statistics estonia, in estonia in the last 14 822 people, get out of here but 13 792.
This means that the immigration exceeded the second year after the exodus.
Most of the out - and sissekolijate are Estonian citizens, but more to have them leave consumers.
It was, therefore, uk citizens net migration last year 2000 people with disadvantages.
Estonians migrate to in particular Finland and Estonia.

Especially now this week, when are the most important samples, I am especially keenly practiced and it works.
Yourself smiling activates the brain and increases the tone.
It isn't just an empty phrase.
I think that people do not yet know pooligi things in your body, which the universe offers, but I guess everyone themselves discover it gradually.
Immediately, now is an important moment in the hand.
You are also a kind of ritual before the conductors of the remote control take?
Is still, the clothes should be exchanged for more comfortable.
It is this small moment to myself.
But in general, yes, I don't have the opportunity before a large presentation of the rest or a small nap to make.
In fact, I even like the people to actively communicate, even before dirigendipulti take.
But come all the Birgitta Festival, here is what to discover also not particularly large opera and ballet to a friend!

Electric car revolution will significantly change metals demand.
Who are the winners and losers?
A little of this, that the electric car revolution will significantly change all of the fuel up the infrastructure, it creates also metallituru in new winners and losers.
Although kaevandusgigant such as Glencore can say that the one place they win and the other lose, then the smaller mining companies were it does not help.
Currently serves on the Glencore coal and oil, but hereinafter referred to as the electric cars in an era of growing cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and niklinõudlus.
This year is the electric cars of the spread of contributions raised by the united kingdom, France and Norway the governments decisions, which allow lähiaastakümnetel to ban fossil fuels the use of new car sales.
Therefore, we already have a Volvo some have, that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine, and Tesla will bring to market a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts are already sold in the two decades electric cars more than the oil produced from fuels used for cars.
"Some of the metal part makes it the most", said Capital Economics tooraineanalüütik Simona Gambranini to Bloomberg.
We have already seen the major impact of such metals as cobalt and lithium, for which demand is growing.
Electric cars are about three times more copper than tavaauto, announced Glencore.
More copper is needed to charge stations, so Exane BNP Paribase estimates that this will increase by 2025. years copper demand by about five percent.
Electric car batteries the growth in demand means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and mangaaninõudlust.
Glencore can be the growing electric vehicle trend had copper hinnatõusult and from this, that is the world's largest koobaltitootja, forecasts Jefferies Group.
This brokerage company estimates that there are other electric cars of the triumph of the victors Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market reacts to the already changing trends.
This year on the London metal exchange cobalt expensive over 70 percent.
Last year's increase in prices was 37 percent.
Also copper is this year's higher cost of 14 percent, mainly growth due to the.
Glencore's share price rose in London on 20 percent, being hinnatõusult crossed rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo Americani.
Losing is in the lead in dealing with companies such as Recyclex and Campin, who must adapt to the new era.
Lead main end-use is for petrol and diesel cars starter to supply power from the batteries.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk pliinõudlusele except if found this other purpose, which could overcome the decreasing demand," said Bank of America Merrill lynch's metal market analüüsijuht Michael Widmer.
Lead price movements in the form have not yet lahtirulluva trend effects noticed.
Lead is this expensive over 17 percent, whereas it is in London, the main industrial metals among hinnatõusult the best metal.
Investors see problems in the metal only in the distant future.
"I'm not sure that the lead is this so bad, because cheap oil to keep tavaauto of the competition", said metallimaaklerfirma Triland Metalsi sales manager Herwig Schmidt.
If the lead demand falls, this will happen slowly.
Can be happens to it so about ten years after.
In the meantime, a mean stricter exhaust gas standards, in order to grow a hybrid car demand, which depend on the frequency close to engine startup, the advanced lead-based battery in the battery, assess the international lead and zinc " research organisation.
Kergmetallid such as aluminum will replace steel as a lighter car will be less electricity to travel further.
This is explained already in the 2013-2016 years by additional 1.6 million tonnes of alumiinimuminõudlus.
This represents 2.7 percent of the aluminum of the world total.
Most likely, this trend worsens, said Widmer.
Aluminum is this expensive advanced 13 percent, due to the increasing demand by automotive firms has led to a market deficit.
Steelmakers do not sleep.
AK Steel Holding cooperates with General Motors, that the use of nanotechnology imekergete car bodies production.
Also ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are trying to develop lighter alloys to the steel, in order to stand against the alumiinimumi.
"High-strength steel should be the answer to this development", said Exane BNP Paribase analyst Sylvain Brunet.
Europe is seeing some success.
Naftaajastu end can also bring suffering plaatinale.
Last year it took about a half of this precious metal for diesel cars, catalysts, announced metallirafineerija Johnson Matthey.
"Many of the currently high demand for raw materials such as oil and platinum may not in the future increase the demand to be", said Natixise tooraineanalüütik Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole are becoming less important, but their importance makes 15 years.
Plaatinatootja believe the continued demand for diiselhübriidauto for.
Uncore's driver Marc Grynberg said that, by 2025. year sold continue to täiselektriautode more and more hybrid cars.
Plaatinatootja of the big hope 10 year term is the Toyota Motori and Hyundai Motosi developed vesinikelemendist based on cars that depend on platinum to produce hydrogen to generate electricity.
So far this is not technology yet commercially justified.
"Diesel seems to be the clear loser on the road for electric cars", said Exane BNP paribase from the Brunet.
German car manufacturers said in July, high rebound partially, because the Stuttgart court refused to diesel the use of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche home town.

Barcelona was paid to 222 million euros (262 million dollars) alone for the fact that brazil its contract to buy out, and neymar the salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some neymar the French club transplant financial aspects.
PSG-l is undoubtedly possible neymar of recruitment and their tähtederohke into the lineup to add this kind of money out of the process, whereas a team funded by the Qatar energiarikkurist the reigning family.
Clubs have allowed players to recruit more to spend, but they need to balance this legal sissetulekuallikatega, which allow them to jalgpalliäris ones to come out.
FFP-le laid the foundation of Michel Platini after he was elected in 2007. year, the UEFA president.
This former French player believed that clubs who fall for the success of the search of a large debt, dealing with the fact, cheating in and risking ruin of, if banks or owners should support a waiver.
From 2011. the year focuses on the FFP clubs debts rather than their losses.
This change means that the business model, what Roman Abramovich used first 2003. in Chelsea's - to buy potential with the club and then make the high costs that team a better change and a global brand to create - it is more difficult to implement.
FFP in the current three-year evaluation period, which lasts until 2018. years, may the club carry up to 30 million euros losses.
And despite the fact that Platini exclusion 2015. in shame, in the context of the president, has his UEFA a descendant of Aleksander Ceferin committed to still excess spending obstacles.
"FFP is definitely not dead and we will continue without a doubt referred to as their rules to be strengthened," said last week The Associated Press Andrea Traverso, who is a UEFA s FFP supervisor.
Although PSG paid neymar the üleostmisklausli for one tervikväljamaksena, they may be able to allocate this amount for accounting purposes of the entire contract within the validity period into parts.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so it is possible to show üleminekutasu the next five years (44,4 million euro amount.
FFP sanctions in the first wave for 2014. year became the PSG, together with the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester city, with the neck of the most severe penalties.
PSG-le was assigned a 60 million euro (at this point the 82 million dollar) large / fine, which was reduced later to 20 million, and the club claim the Champions League squad restriction 2014-2015. in season 21 player normal 25 instead.
UEFA looks for clubs who may try to outwit the over regulating financial institutions, by blowing your income to the club with owners of related businesses.
Qatar, the company may PSG-d sponsored, but if the sponsorship value is considered to be the standard turumäärasid in excess, do not allow the UEFA it official as income taken into account.
So happened in 2014. year, when UEFA decided that the Qatar Tourism Authority of the PSG to support the value of was bloated.
It has been said that a certain part of the neymar the PSG service can come in 2022. the year of the world cup management committee payments via Qatar.
But PSG and the Qatar 2022 deny that Neymarist could get a world cup ambassador, and claim that UEFA's regulatory authorities capable of such a maneuver easily unfold.
PSG-le previously assigned penalties mean that UEFA are even more vigilant with regard to any aspirations the rules ignored.
The situation of familiar people have said on Thursday that UEFA is not the PSG-ga neymar the transition to proactively discussed.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that will ensure their anonymity, as they are not allowed to PSG situation to discuss.
The latest published reports indicate that PSG earned 2015-2016. year season more than 10 million euros to a profit of approximately 542,4 million euro turnover.
In the last financial year data is not yet published.
PSG hopes that neymar of the arrival affects the well sponsorlustehingutele, trade and särgimüügile.
The club looks under the agreement turnover of at least 30 percent of the size of the growth.
The Spanish too, being clearly upset one of the largest football departure, tried to neymar of the transition to prevent, claiming that the PSG violation of this FFP-d.
"It is clear "financial doping" in the case of club and country," said La Liga president Javier Tebas Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that the PSG belongs mainly to Kuwait.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American spordimagnaadile, sharing the La Liga stance, that the state of the finances of the club.
"This is property rights result and this is the last 15 years completely all jalgpallimaastikku changed," said Wenger on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
Very difficult to have fair play financial rules respected, because the state may be other ways or other interests, that such a big player in the state."

Clean beaches secret: the night cleaning and poor rannailm
Colder summer also mean smaller koristusvaeva Tallinn sites.
"If without, then are the people on the beach, and if not, then there is also the people", said beach cleaners.
North-Tallinn Stroomi beach cried out to the gulls.
Offer them a melodious competition low revs põrin the tractor, which plaaž to the stripes off the bear.
In fact, the screening of the last seven centimeter depth of sand through, picking out marine litter and the people left behind risu: bottle caps, sigaretikonid and more.
People come still to the beach, regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If there is nice weather, then it is the people on the beach, and if not, then there is also the people", said the private company Haabersti Managed by beach cleaning head Aleksandr Usov.
The time is 6.30 and the beach goes bitter chore, because at eight the bail must be people procedure.
Usov is a position already on the clock of the four.
Moreover, Stroomi he will keep an eye out for more Pirita, Harku lake, Kakumäe and Paljassaare Pikakari beach.
Waste quantities are reduced.
Years ago there was so much more.
People can now assess what is being done", said Usov, who is the beach clean up has been 15 years.
Before was so, that when something new got up, it was already the next day broken.
Now already stored in it, which the beach is.
Clean the beach price
One of the major works of Estonian beaches is washed ashore mereprügi or bady cleaning.
For example, Pirita beach to be this beach apart from the advantage of a tow of 400 000 tonnes.
"This is an incredible quantity", notes Usov.
The second major category constitutes household waste, i.e. all this, which people left behind.
Poolteisekilomeetrise at Stroomi beach in the strip has eight large trash, which is needed three times a week to empty.
So much so there will be garbage.
However, colder summer is meant that the garbage is a fifth less than otherwise.
The third type of form, abandoned things.
Most often, these lastelelude.
This yield as is Usov sand from the inside out shovel a dozen mudelauto.
They remain the owners wait for the beach in reference to the puittee.
"Usually they need to be more out, but this is a normal catch." Usov already knows that soon he finds these re-sand the inside.
Children come to the beach and take the toys to them again in the sand drown.
Garbage shall be thrown scattered
Haabersti administrative services representative Erika Scholler admits that the tractor sõelumistööd disrupt the local.
The noise, which lasts öötund from the early hours of the recipient, mixed with a neighborhood of people living und.
On the day it is work but impossible.
One in six to be the beach two times through the screening.
"If we do not, then the district fine for playing our", notes Scholler.
But the goal is similar to Pirita, Pikakari, and the Following can also Stroomi beach with the international blue flag quality mark.
"Compared to Europe, Estonia has much more work to beaches should be maintained," said Scholler.
We have more bady and the stone and heavier sand to parse.
But our beaches less garbage than the rest of Europe.
To hear that the beach talks trash, take the Stroomi beach just outside the lively Martin effortlessly journalist and koristustöötajate discussion, highlighting the beach, the current bottlenecks.
The morning is on every side obscene image.
The problem is the birds and pudelikorjajatega, who is bags inside out attracted", declares Martin.
Although it is difficult to assume that people are able to your current behaviour to change, then Martin hopes that the municipality will take something to the recycle bin and put them as the lids apart, to prevent at least the birds there, beyond powerful running.
General Martin, however, Stroomi beach development comfortable with.
It is seen that the city take care of it.
Lasteväljakul, lit and freshly surfaced roads, it has become more pleasant.
Never was so, that the roller skates only got a one way ride", notes Martin.

The Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25% at
The Bank of england is expected to make the announcement, that interest rates will remain at the previous level, because of the prostrate growth and easing of inflation is to soften the speculation regarding the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as households plagued by income has put interest rates on hold.
The bank rahapoliitikakomitee (MPC) policy makers voted 6:2 the rate of 0.25% of the kept for by the and less members required this month to rise, as slow economic growth has been attenuated to support growth.
Your compiling quarterly inflatsiooniraport in cut bank, 2017. year growth of 1.7% and 2018. year its 1.6%, and warned that the pressure on household incomes remains, since the fall is expected to remain inflation to rise close to 3%.
However, giving the bank also signaled that rates of growth are in the next few years brexi maintenance due to inflation to curb the needful and the financial markets may be necessary borrowing costs as expected, higher than the rise of the.
Members voted a year ago brexi was as a result of gear released to boost the economy of the mammutpaketi partial redemption by.
The bank shall terminate in February for a temporary rahastusskeem, which offers banks cheap funding, although said that now there is this diagram in the framework of the expected 15 billion pounds by greater supply, which is 115 billion pounds.
Rate in respect of the decision taken in the minutes said the bank: "the MPC keskprognoosis remain gross domestic product (GDP) in the near future unnerving, since household real income, a difficult situation will also hereinafter referred to as the consumption effect."
Rates of repeat that inflation mitigation is necessary "monetary policy in some of the tight pulling" and "somewhat greater" extent than markets have expected.
The stock exchange expect the first rise in the next year in the third quarter and another rise in the year 2020.
But the bank stressed that any kind of jumping is gradual and limited.
The bank reduced forecasts for growth this and next year are comparable to the may forecast of 1.9% and 1.7%.
2018. year of 1.8 per cent growth forecast remained constant.
After this the news of the decline of the pound against the dollar and the euro.
The pound dropped 0,5% of 1.31 U.S. dollars and 0.4% 1,11 euro.
The decision changes not to do so is due to the recent disappointing kasvunäitajatest, which has dampened growing hopes regarding the rise  GDP rose in the second quarter from the previous three months by 0.2% after 0.3%.
The bank said that the growth remains in the third quarter is likely to 0,3%, while the end of the year it will be a little momentum gathering.
The bank's latest inflatsiooniraport gave the rising inflation and the wretched wage suffering from households rejoice a little reason, saying that the situation goes before the improvement, still a bit worse.
It added that monetary policy cannot prevent the next few years, the income hit, hit, but the three-year forecast towards the end of the expected salary of a noticeable recovery.
A weak pound due to stimulate the economy also growing demand for British produce, which reimburses partly the consumers ' lower spending.
The decision comes after a year of this, when the rates were passed in August to 0.25% after shocking the EU referendum, which caused the pound to a sudden weakening.
The bank estimates that the cost is likely to be four years, that prices and the economy fully to breathe life into.
Before the bank's last decision was to recognize the growing demand the rate of increase, as inflation had increased the pressure on hard-pressed households; in July called for three policy makers, the rate of increase of 0,5%.
Inflation fell last month to 2.6%, compared to June to 2.9%, although the bank said that it was to be expected, and in the following months, waiting once again in front of the rise.
The bank said that the excessive growth compared to the 2-percent objective was due entirely to weak nails.
Corect hüpoteegimaaklerid manager Andrew Montlake says: "the exchange rate of the recent decline whereas it seems that the mortgage market is once again becoming more competitive, as the lenders desire in the work and expect to finish the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to them, whose valid transactions begin to complete the reach, because of the refinancing, often free of charge and at a low rate, has become increasingly popular."

Kõrgelu living - poolkorrus and smart disaininipid have made this small at the Earls Court apartments offer the space in the home
Joanne Leigh, the former banker, who is passionate about kinnisvarauuendaja, exchange your high-Knightsbridge'(i home 2014. in Earls Court apartment.
It is located in the Queen Anne Terrace's on the first floor and this, that Joanne is not your bag, the total packed and the apartments sold, is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that I was living with a former partner Knightsbridge'is much greater on the surface," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something that would be in my price offered for the equivalent.
I was shown this Earls Court apartments, and this had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with this and I made a same day bid."
From the first visit it is 93 square metres the apartment has undergone a full refurbished.
In the beginning it was one bedroom and the complex layout of the apartment - the bedroom to reach the fire walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add storage space and poolkorruse to take advantage of the high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi Notting Hill from acting as the architectural and disainistuudio from Duck & Shed to use up to 3.8 m height of the ceilings and create a home that would simply not be arendusobjekt, but the place where Joanne will be able to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms on top of each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create poolkorrus, where you can be standing upright.
Erfan was going to approach things creatively.
"The metal structure is quite complex," he explains.
"We had the rooms re-organised, so that they be on top of each other, without having to worship.
It was not just a platform for the construction, but we used steel construction that both the upper and lower space height would be right."
This arrangement allowed the erfan on the cause in the space of each other two täiskõrgusega room with plenty of dramatic elements.
Poolkorrus from opens old fashioned from copper with light Retrouviuse from the window view at the bottom of the glamorous the living space.
The reflecting surface with golden furniture, silver details and vintage kind of Serge Mouille's lighting to accentuate the room's style.
The mirror you use plays a role in the theatrical, spacious and bright the added.
A short corridor on each end are attached to the mirrors that it appears to be longer.
Kitchen leaves the mirror with the rear wall to another room, opened the window impression.
At the entrance offers peegelkapp storage space for all Joanne's söögiriistadele and klaasnõudele.
The living room add to the charm of the possibility of the kitchen element of the shut down, when not in use, creating the image of a glamorous from the room.
Folding kitchen are not something new.
This kitchen is but the unique fact that this is a garage type ülestõstetav the door.
"This went slightly projekteerimisvaeva," explains Erfan terastugevdusega veneered MDF-based doors.
"This is a workaround, so it darted very simply, if it to push."
Due to space and storage space with smart use of is Joanne's il now 16 lisaruutmeetrit, additional bedrooms, and the best korteriplaan.
"After all, it is floor space that is what you sell - or what gives real estate its value," says Erfan.
"The real estate agent to take the outdated form of room and makes the calculations based on floor area."
Here they have managed to floor space increase, using the high quality materials, which add room to the luxury.
"Materials are those that you touch and that will help thereby home an emotional bond with the cause," said Erfan.
"You do not grace in the wall into the elektrikaabeldus.
It is important, but do not put the heart language of the ring."
This shows that good design and the increased surface area will help make a rather ordinary apartment, nothing phenomenal.
In fact, they can even generate a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
The main character Dane Jensen is the Chicago skyscrapers in acting as a bounty hunter, who is vying for a colleague in the promotion after.
Do not read other than the earned amount of money, next to which is forgotten all ethics.
His wife and three children sees man only in the early morning and late in the evening.
The movie in the first half to hit yourself with the thought that it is, after all, "Kaardimaja" in the business world version - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butleri speech pattern is similar.
What the film forward, the less kaadrimajalikku elements however remain and the filmmakers of moraliseeriv intention will increasingly stand out.
Elumuutev experience can be the main characters in the son's cancer.
Now we must make a choice between work and family.
Arhitektiametist the dream of the son puts the father walks in Chicago for large buildings at thinking about truly important things like faith, goodness, love..., touching does not remain even the twin towers disaster.
After the third scene, where the son of the father, the eye opens, there will be a feeling that the filmmakers are based on the target audience will certainly cry, because even the most cold hearted viewer not to be able to tears ago keep cute cancer boy suffering seeing.
If the son into a coma fell and his situation have hopeless it seems, can the father finally understand his work moraalitusest and make a good deed look for a job to the old man.
Now the errors I sense myself with a bet - if the movie has a happy end, then the rewards for your perceptive awareness after movie coffee with, but if wrong, you can script the at least one surprise for approved.
For a moment there is doubt that the remains I of the coffee without - then, if the spouse is calling Dane'ile from the hospital and a man rushed in slow motion down the corridor of the ward.
The son is, however, quite wonderfully recovered, and though his father is just losing a job, turned out to be still positive, because now is the time to deal with family.
I can also feel this way - I can in American drama at the end of the already pretty well predict!
In fact is a movie well constructed, all the necessary elements are available.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and moral beauty: the money is not most important in life.
You will bring this film well on.
While building the new personaliülem plans to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps you can John F. Kelly also really handle.
In this case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the White House new personaliülem plans to limit the president while building a better strength efficiency flow of information, including news, in the hope that it will keep superior tasasemas in the water.
Here is an excerpt from reporter Josh Dawseylt:
"If the White House new personaliülem John F. Kelly its on the first working day of the senior officials of the total received, he brought out võtmeprobleemi president Donald springboard to the White House, which he plans to resolve  poor information reaching the president's hands.
Kelly said officials, that information must move through her, either on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he / she shared a good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems quite logical, but others also have this event and they have enjoyed the taming of his media consumption of the monitoring of the failure.
The President of springboard ratio of television extends back decades and even now, when he is in the White House, not his telerivaatamisharjumusi somewhere lost.
"If the candidate Trump was unfair media coverage after the annoyed, paid him to show that he was recognised in the impact-making publications also honestly," said the former kampaanianõunik Sam Nunberg in February Politicole.
Politico Tara palmer's wrote at the time that "six former kampaaniatöötaja according to springboard's Twitter-habits control the key to this, if to ensure that he personal media consumption contains stable also praises".
Good though.
But the idea that the springboard of Twitter use habits are never "under control", is ridiculous.
May-be in the know of these kampaaniatöötaja something that the rest of us do not know  that the springboard of the tweets would be without their bau further enflame been more.
We can probably never know in a tweet, on what the Trump card is not posted.
If he helpers were able to he whether or a couple of times out of trouble to save, were their efforts worth it.
But no-one has been able to prevent the building of a consistent controversy there may.
Part of the problem lies in the fact that against each other from the clicks of the white House in trying to get people exclusively in its own interests to promote, communicate in Trumpile material that supports their worldview, but may not always be credible.
The whole story of course reflects the Politico wrote in may advisors a tendency to feed to the president for strategically questionable information.
One of the examples, as described by reporter Shane Goldmacher, is as follows:
"Current and former springboard for the subject to say, that the Trump card may respond to the negative press, especially of the injurious effects of the infoleketele, exponentially, having obsessed with their lähteallika identification.
So happened also at the end of February, if someone gave kahjurõõmsalt president of the printed copy of the internetiprovokaatorile Charles C. Johnson, of the web page GotNews.com the article, which accused personaliülem the deputies Katie Repeated in this, that he appears to be the White House "a number of leak source".
There is no difference between that Johnson is a mockery of due to Twitter permanently blocked or that he did not offer any specific evidence or that he is also a past false accusations made by the and these ago.
Trump read the article and began to the subordinate Repeated on the heir."
Goldmacher added that the then personaliülem Reince Priebe and the White House office of the head of the Rob Porter "has tried to introduce the system into better reach document management and document".
How is this managed?
Kelly tries to three months later, exactly the same make.
Maybe he proves to be priebe a wide range of more efficient management, but the Trump card is still impulsive and her helpers team are still impact on the group.
These unchanging factors make Kelly the mission very difficult.

Audi updates the car manufacturers to hit the critic in the middle of up to 850 000 diiselsõidukit
The day before the Audi announcement said the BMW that offers tarkvaratäiendust more than 350 000 vehicle.
BMW according to the chairman believes the company, that "there are more intelligent options than sõidupiirang", referring to European cities, including BMW's hometown to Müncheniga, which is considered the diesel ban or restriction.
Daimler announced Tuesday that renews the diesel engine exhaust to reduce the three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe.
None of the company not described in these operations recall as.
European car manufacturers have been advertising in Europe and the United States eagerly for diesel use, in order to help comply with carbon dioxide emissions imposed by regulation.
However, diesel engines emitted nitrogen oxides is considered to be a carcinogen and it can cause asthma.
It also increases autotööstusettevõtete for diesel vehicles emit the exhaust gas to neutralise the installation of the equipment cost, the change in the car price competitive in the secrecy difficult.
At the same time as the German car manufacturers are in-depth under investigation, accused of also chancellor Angela merkel's government powerful car manufacturers indulge in, and the problem in the failure to comply.
Companies are trying to avoid the Volkswagen repetition of mistakes, who remained silent behind the so-called petuseadmete use, which allowed to adjust the exhaust gas readings auto testing time regulations to comply, but pulled under normal driving.
A number of the Volkswagen management has been presented in the United States, the prosecution and the other is on both sides of the Atlantic, under investigation.
Last month, arrested in Germany, Audi mootoriarenduse department, thermodynamics division of the former president.
The former president Zaccheo Giovanni pam antonio is an Italian, and therefore, not issue for protected and may go to court in the United States.
Early this year wrapped up the Audi in Germany Volkswagenit the lack of a kriminaaluurimisse, as the authorities blamed the Audit of the system installation, that the shirk of the European exhaust emissions requirements, thereby broadening the investigation, which was focused on in the past in the United States.
Audi's involvement in the research may be the Volkswagen big hoop  luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionately large part of Volkswagen's profits.

Journalist's murder highlights growing dangers in Mexico
Weekly newspaper Riodoce staff gather usually on Wednesdays, to look over the plans for the Sinaloa state of the most recent chaos to reflect what the sow organized crime, corrupt officials and stop fixed narkosõjad.
But today, they have accumulated a personal tragedy in the guise of discussing their own security.
They are told that it is important for your routine to change.
Two vanemajakirjanik the discuss, whichever seems safest: whether or not to bring children with them to the office, which was in 2009. in the grenade to the target, or leave them home.
Security experts have written to the space at the head located on the chalkboard three words: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They asked the reporters on each of the column names to offer  no evidence is required, sufficient of impressions and sisetunne.
The government or a cartel payroll, have proven to be suspected uimastikaubitsejaid, politicians, businessmen and journalists  a whole list of pahalane, who make the Mexico of the chaos to reflect on the dangerous.
Violence is not hingetõmbepaus and the more dead bodies across the country together to accumulate, the greater part of them are journalists  the Committee to protect journalists data are those from president Enrique Pena Nieto appointed sworn of 2012. year in December, at least 25. 589 journalists after attacks and threats under state protection, and this year has become so far the death of at least seven journalists in the seven states.
Recent deaths include those of the editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of your many narkovägivald of relating to books.
His absence will be deeply felt, although his presence can be perceived everywhere  Riodoce building facade hangs a big picture of the middle finger for being valdez together with the letter of "Justice" and two 30s reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing a T-shirt, which is depicted in her smile, the glasses on the face or him distinctive panamakübar.
The meeting will take place in less than two months after he death. Reporters discuss common trauma, your nightmare, insomnia, paranoia.
Although 2010. the journalists handling the case of a separate public prosecutor's office, is the Committee to protect journalists data taken to prosecute only two cases.
As most of the annual drug trafficking and organized crime-related murder case, in which a number of thousands, to reach also the killings of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodoce newspaper will continue to Sinaloas dominant violence with the recognition, even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the murderers of data and fair, without no security on the meeting Ibarra, according to many benefits.
"Very silly is your time here at the meeting to waste," he said.
"Until the cause is not known, the distrust of all."
Valdez left the state in the capital city of Culiacanis from Riodoce of office 15. may in the morning.
He managed to drive in just a few quarters, before the two men he red Toyota Corolla were stopped. He was forced out of the car alight and he was shot 12 times. It is expected the newspaper's name after, which means the translation without the "twelfth of the river".
The armed man drove valdez in the car to go and made it in the vicinity of the emergency.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors spread Culiacanis freely.
However, valdez on the subject prevails essentially only silence.
From Guzmani arrest last year, and the United States issued in January, the Sinaloa been in a state of one of the most bloodiest battlefield, as rival clicks against the vacuum of power in the execution of after.
No difference, to Sinaloa on the streets are released every day, a few people or even several off, or that the graveyard teems with an abundance of decorated double from narkokuninga you mausoleumide, which is larger than many living in homes.
Forget for a moment that a period of peace, the valuable ports and the United States refer to uimastimarsruutidega the seaside state draws only one cartel.
Despite all this, and the fact that the Valdez was their work with the risks in a totally aware, feels Riodoce co-founder and president Ismail Bojorquez (60) huge compunction to take, that he failed his friends to protect.
He believes that the slaughter contributed two errors.
The first of these was Guzmani sons competing and sõjajalal the cartel click the ringleader Damaso Lopeziga made in an interview published in February.
This piece of writing may have sons angry to  suspected jõuguliige the bought all of the edition copies away as soon as they ajalehekioskitesse reached.
The second error was that the Valdez is not forced by his own security group to leave the country after that, when the sweep of one with the other in the same story reflects the middle peasant backgrounds.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point for journalists against violence in Mexico.
He was so long a life remained to her friends and colleagues assumed that he is always there.
He worked in 2003. in the newspaper Noroeste at veteranreporteri as, when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, sold in 50-dollars financial units.
Bojorquez said that the Sinaloas "it was impossible to press without a drug problem untouched to deal with".
The history of the amount of will multiply your bold and honest reflect with awareness and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters like to publish robust studies without censorship, without fear and readers fascinated in print, which they got to read stories that someone else did not dare to reflect.
Eight years after the Riodoce establishment won the newspaper its Latin America reflected for the prestigious Maria Moors Caboti award.
In the same year won the Valdez Committee to protect journalists (AKK) international press freedom award for his courage followed by Mexico narkoloo this everywhere where it leads.
He admitted openly that fear.
"I want to continue to live," he said AKK in accepting the award.
Last October, he told the television station to Rompeviento TV in an interview that drug trafficking is the Sinaloas way of life.
"You need to take to embrace the task, which ajakirjanikuametiga comes  another option is to stupid to play.
I do not want, that me asking would that what I so many deaths in the face I did or why I did not talk about what is going on."
Riodoce collective yearning Valdez, jokes experienced hand who talk dirty like a sailor, friends who share in the kindly embrace of and advice to, teachers, who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He wore always his hat.
He went to the office across the road situated in El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if its rutiiniarmastust became to him fatal.
He death is also them yourself to doubt, how their work best done and to stay alive.
"They don't like, if mess around with their women, their children, their legitimate business of their secret ships, which are used for drug transportation."
"These things should not have been exposed," said Bojorquez.
The result is even at the best of times a strong self-censorship and enesealalhoid.
Their instincts of trust.
If a thing smells suspicious, keep away from.
Riodoce editor Andres Villarreali said is a problem with this, that "the sense of smell can be deceiving... and so it happened this thing Javieriga".
He and others say, that the Sinaloas no longer apply the old rules, exactly as they are valid Tamaulipasi, Veracruzis, Guerreros, nor in any other state, which is home to cost-effective smugeldamismarsruutide, weak institutions, and corrupt public officials the toxicity of the communities.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff turvakoolitus for the total received, there was suddenly no more cell phones allowed; some days before this reveal, that only the governments sold the spyware had been used in Mexico for journalists and activists to monitor.
In front of the house searched for two police officers fruit in the guise of relief to the 40 degrees of heat.
The government set the amount they guard the Riodoce of the office, which is located in the neljakorruselises building Culiacani middle-class neighborhood.
Some reporters were reflecting poolnaljatades whether these police officers are included in their 50 percent of police officers among whom the governor itself is unreliable stamped.
Several months have passed since the time when reporters have travelled to mägistesse countryside areas, where control is de facto narkojõukude hand.
Riodoce this week's edition dealt with three main stories.
One of them was a former poksilegendi Julio Cesar chavez of brother's murder Sinaloas.
In addition, they have revealed the story of government funds expending the governor's hometown.
And the prosecutor's office of the block away from Culiacani from one of the most expensive of a restaurant was kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official announcement on who was robbed, or how it happened, so had to be careful when it was time to write it, what all the town knows  the restaurant is so uimastikauplejate as well as the authorities meelispaik.
The Reporter received the public documents to know that the restaurant is registered with the politician's name, who belongs to the power into the Institutional Revolutsioonipartei (IRP), which dominates all policy levels almost throughout the last century.
In recent times there are several IRP governor accused of widespread coverage of the case in the context of corruption.
Villarreal a lot of reporters on the write from the previous incident in the same place, including how the nickname El Chapo wear Guzmani son escaped sõjaväereidist.
All from a few months earlier would have readers looking valdez of the columns, in order to get kidnapping information on the best sources.
"In the past we would already know what happened," said the 46-year-old Villarreal, who kleenuke physique has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all the communication channels of our sources has been interrupted."
Valdez the office has become a storage space for tags and stickers, which is protesting the killings of journalists, and the editorial staff has received something, what they could not ever wait  activists press on behalf of.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of the tag and headed on the next morning the local public prosecutor's office at the demonstrations to yet another journalist after.
Salvador Adame lost areas in western Michoacani, three days after valdez the killing.
Found a burnt dead body and officials say it falls DNA testing on the basis of him.
Journalists are all over the country vocal become more and scribbled the organized protests as pavement and buildings, the phrase "SOS press".
This day is the president Bojorquez away in Washington, trying to collect Valdez case recover a sense of justice for international support.
The day after the valdez the death of the Sinaloa governor with a meeting with the accused in Ramirez the authorities to journalists next to ferret management and their killing of the truth about due to.
After that, a lot of it, that he directed the government's action to reflect from the rest, to worry, to anger, he is objectivity affected.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists is organized crime, kaassüüdlaste from public officials and unresponsive society by the "besieged".
In his recent book "Narkoajakirjandus" he wrote, that the reporters did not kill only narkojõugud, but also politicians and the security forces command, who is organized crime in mestis.
Media monitoring group Articulo 19 assignment last year, more than half of the journalists ründamistest the police and civil servants.
"In mexico you die, because you want to be should be silenced," said Ramirez.
Murder effects are clearly in the east.
No one will forget blogger Maria Elizabeth Maciase death at the northern piiriosariigis Tamaulipasi six years ago.
He body was found along with a letter which was probably written under the cartel Los Zetas: "I'm here for their reports after."
His severed head next to the lay arvutiklaviatuur and headphones.
Some publications are chosen for their doors to close, for example, the newspaper El Norte at the northern piiriosariigis Chihuahuas after their correspondent Miroslava Breachi killing in march.
The other children are on, as did the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after their head of murder in 2004. year.
2010. year, spoke to the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez narkokartell openly on the front cover take up with the slogan "What you us want you?".
Some journalists have koduosariiki from the or even from the country fled.
It is a contest of decision.
In exile it is difficult to find a job and they need to still the streets of the gaze, that the risks avoided.
And sometimes bring them back, as happened with probably the photographer's Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four woman 2015. year one in Mexico in the apartment three months after the Veracruzist escape.
Those who remain in place and continue to work, must every day risky decisions around the dance.
Ibarra, who wanted ever poetry out get, acknowledges that the drug industry's recognition of scares him.
"Mexico is on the way to hell and that's why I'm a reporter for the I started," he said.
One recent Friday at midnight, when the latest number was already in the lock punched, sat Riodoce delivered to the office in front of the sidewalk and sipped the beer, when suddenly began to all phones to vibrate.
Beach in the resort town of Mazatlanis was rival gangs and security forces has taken place between a ceasefire, have died in confirmed data on 19 people.
The war escalated to continue as permits also the number of regions found in the cartel deleted messages.
Sealtsamast pavement edge put reporters on the news of the mobile phone using the Riodoce posted on the website.
The next day the front cover needed to be changed.
Sirens hoot along  yet another in a firefight in the region.
Bojorquez peek in the guard of police officers by, to see if they are vigilant.
If they fear the known, not shown they do, at least.
The history of the fallen founder of the massive portrait, which his middle finger is to see the whole Sinaloa, editor of Riodoce staff follow in his footsteps.
"How could any closure think," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day, when Javier was killed, a lot of trainees, that can it to the streets reportage?"
The dinosaur used the enemies to avoid kaitsevärvus the
At first glance, it seems like the shape, although quite scary.
Scientists have disclosed the now first find the context of the canadian miners discovered the incredible ninasarvikusuuruse creatures, which are so well preserved, that experts have described it as "the dinosaurs Mona Lisat".
It is even so well-preserved that it was even possible to detect that his scales covered in leather was a red-brown color and his past had been somewhat "complicated".
In the journal Current Biology published the reportage describes the creatures as "the best preserved soomusdinosaurust, which is never found" and as "one of the best dinosauruseisendit in the world".
Fossil is a new nodosauruse species, which lived in the cretaceous in the middle, 110-112 million years ago.
This incredibly good preservation of the bog researchers, who describe it as "truly significant".
It scales with coated vegetarian is the magazine of the National Geographic data, the best preserved of this type of fossil that has ever been found.
This can be found in 21. march 2011 Shawn Funk, when he mining Instruments Millenium mining in the Fort McMurray near Northern Alberta Canada.
He hit nothing, which is pointing out the surrounding stone, and decided to take a closer look.
The discovery of the fossil was sent to the Royal tyrrell the paleontoloogiamuuseumi.
The following six years was working on it, that creates a 2500-pound daily (1100-pounds) parcels out of the appeal.
After all this hardship is the final result now finally unveiled the production ready to go.
"If a little eye squint, you could almost believe that he sleeps," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell museum, where living creatures are exposed.
"It's going to be a scientific journal into one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosauruseisendina - dinosaurs Mona."
He skin researching found the researchers, that it taimesööjate, who though covered with scales, and resembles a walking-tank, endangered, is likely to be significantly lihatoiduline dinosaurs.
This multiplicity of scales of the dinosaur used the red and white kaitsevärvus, in order to hide themselves from predators, and implemented varjumistehnikat, called vastuvarjutusele and what to use also many of today's animals.
This allowed industry experts said the dinosaurs takes the better surroundings to blend in and the enemy to avoid, since the major dinosaurs considered him likely to hunt.
This 110 million year old nodosauruste family-owned creature reached for the first time in the headlines in may, and have now visited the Royal tyrrell the paleontoloogiamuuseumi.
Researchers are now being researched and gave it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli museum laboratory assistant Mark Mitchell, who belonged to the team, which spent to create vaevanõudev be exposed to more than 7000 hours.
Thanks to the individuals of the amazingly good preservation was dr. mitchell's and international researchers in the team can be documented scales of the shape and size of the animal body.
They discovered vastuvarjutusele - the animal kingdom of the spread kaitsemeetodi, which means that the living creatures, the top half was darker than the bottom.
Although vastuvarjutusele is common, come to find as a surprise, since Borealopelta is much higher than today live vastuvarjutusele animals.
This hints that the dinosaurs of the hunt were enough to active the other meat eaters of the dinosaurs, to the evolution of the preferred ellujäämistaktikana confrontation instead of the shadows into the.
But most of the modern vastuvarjutusele the use of animals - such as deer, zebras or armadillid - is to catch as many smaller and more vulnerable, which suggests that the nodosaurus had to survive to truly bother.
"Immensely large and numerous scales covered the dinosaur robust hunting shows, how dangerous could the cretaceous dinosaurs predators to be," said Brown.
Scales of organic compounds chemical analysis reveals also, that dinosaur skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to create the investigation, to get clues of this life, including the gut preserved in the content, to find out what animal your last meal ate.
They believe that the dinosaur fell either into the river, reaching thereby flow into the sea, where he sank back in front of the other.
At this time, was Alberta as warm as now South Florida, and the rivers and oceans of the scale are likely to be much farther inland than at present.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable, since he is fully covered with preserved soomuselise skin, while he has remained also three-dimensional, while maintaining the creator of the original shape," said Brown.
"This result provides creates nowadays looks almost the same as kriidiajastu.
This reconstruction does not need very much imagination to use - just eye kissitas and felt is that it as if to sleep."
The cretaceous was a time when the Land of wandering, the huge, two feet move the meat eaters of the dinosaurs - teropoodid.
Although all of the king of the Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, could this armored dinosaurs the hunt for some of his formidable predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 meters) long and six-tonne monster.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that the Borealopelta washed up after the death of the sea and it mumifitseerub in the mud.
The creature discovered 21. march 2011 Shawn Funk, if he was mine Millenium mining in the Fort McMurray near Northern Alberta Canada.
The museum said it is the best preserved soomusdinosaurus in the world, including the skin and scales, and this is a complete cone up to the hips.
These creatures were an average of 18 feet (five meters) long and weights up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
Its shoulders stormed out of the two 20 inches, the length of the spike.
The researchers believe that it scales covered taimesööja adventure through the current of Western Canada, until the flooded river in the high seas of the washed.
But the dinosaurs of the undersea burial site helped to maintain the exquisite in the detail of its scales.
This particular specimen fossilized remains are so well preserved, that mügarlikke soomusplaat along the dinosaur skulls cover still nahajäänuseid.
As written by Michael Greshka magazine National Geographic: "Such a stability degree is the same rarity as lotovõit.
The more I look at this, this incredible thing it seems.
Petrified nahajäänuseid cover still the creator of the skull located mügarlikke soomusplaat.
The best front leg was lying beside her, and five squared is stretched upward.
I can his foot on the scales in the census."
How one activist found the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
9. August 2014 became the Brittany Ferrell complete shock.
All from the day after the New York travel sitting in this St. Louis resident Airbnb through rented room on the bed, browsing through your phone on Facebook.
He ran after his former schoolmates to the post.
There was the letter: "the Police killed the just 18-year-old adolescent, and he was lying still on the street."
He was confused as to why someone else did not have this information, its flow posted, so he closed Facebook and opened a Twitter.
Grip @TheePharoah user posts was repeatedly his timeline on shared.
The St. Louis region from rapper to transmit real-time tweets Michael Brown, the unarmed 18-year-old black young man to death, who killed Fergusonis Missouri white policeman.
He posted the picture of the Brown of the earth's surface from the body, which was lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"This is insane," thought the Ferrell himself.
But death was not his nor he community for something new.
He put his phone away, but saw later in the evening, re-tweets, which were reported by this time people accumulation with the canfield Drive'il.
Share was photos politseilindist and karjuvatest of the people and a man who claimed to be brown's father and holding a sign labeled "Ferguson police killing in just my unarmed son!".
He looked at the real-time flow, where the police officer stands barking at the dogs with protesters in front of a group.
Other videos in the rises in one of the second policeman, according to him, the gun and shouted: "I will kill all of you... animals."
Ferrellil remember how it hit myself thinking: "This is unusual."
""It is not this kind of murder, with which we are accustomed and which we could be called typical."
I felt at that moment hirmujudinaid.
I was angry and cried."
He booked the return flight and drove the next day back home.
Being at 23 grounded, he went to the father of their six illustrate the daughter, and decided that they would sail the next morning the two of us Ferguson.
What Ferrelli and ferguson with the next three years takes place, is a central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Whose streets?"), that premiere cinemas 11. August.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness of their people from the perspective of living in this community and who filled out answers to the calls in the streets.
If Ferrell with his daughter - who was wearing a floral dress and head it a suitable crown - Ferguson by the drove, chatted with them again on the subject that they had before this mornings several times before it comes - the black experience and living conditions.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for their rights?" he recalls himself asking.
"We're going to the currently in Ferguson since the police killing of 18-year-old boy and it's not right."
"I couldn't get him not to take," said Ferrell later.
"This, what is currently happening, is... past the the culmination.
He should know this and see the and its the middle of the grow.
He must learn activism and organizing on and to feel also the black experience and the living conditions of the different layers and what we need to do to get free and yourself release.
Even if I succeed in him to grow, so that he did not experience personally the blatant racism, is no different from it in some other black girls.
I feel that would do him a disservice, if protected, would in this world."
The first stop, which they Ferguson reaching it, was South Florissanti by the police station from across the road, which remains in place, which had become aware of the nature of the laagriplats, where the activists were waiting for the news of police officer Darren Wilson, who is not even presented in the end accused.
There pooled Ferrell and his daughter reach the local äriomanikuga, who prepared the lõunaeineid.
They put toidukoti together and helped these protesters share.
Ferrelli for began to slowly take the shape of a new type of activism.
"My activism changed completely after 9. August," he said, noting that when he was Missouri-St. Louis college student, he was a minority of Õendusõpilased Union president, and focuses on the toiduõiglusele and health inequalities for black communities.
"I had no organiseerimiskogemuse.
It all just turned out."
Weeks later in court, Ferrell night of demonstrations during one of the film kaasrežissööri Sabaah Folayaniga.
Folayan said that he and filmioperaator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to just place in the document.
Ferrelli head emerged from the question: "Do you try to place in the document, or find a story that can be exploited?"
Such skepticism was due to the countless number of cases where people - often white - and-coming community and strive to this pain and resilience of the benefit cut.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "we Had heard that Fergusonis born and raised in the people's voice won't be heard and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan was already smitten hands kaasrežissööri Damon Davisega, regional artist, who was known for activism in terms of the relation to death row prisoners.
His involvement in making the project attractive Ferrelli and another six other local for whom the movie "Whose Streets?" the team after brown's shooting in the years to follow.
"This documentary is not talking to someone for us or with us, but we are talking about our own," said Davis.
"For me it was important, how these people portrayed, as is depicted also in me."
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrelli experience - was to show that the movement does not stand for "redeemer coincidence, but to community gatherings in", as in the word Folayan -was he in the movie most open partial.
As a result, record "Whose Streets?" a surprisingly personal aspects Ferrelli lives, like falling in love, and their women with marriage.
"I felt like I would be naked," says Ferrell, laughing for the first time over, when he prepared a film of the saw.
"But I realized that this work and for black people inimlikustamise must be accompanied by certain vulnerability."
What's more, Ferrelli story of the stresses and sean again at the heart of the black homosexual female role in the broader Black Lives Matteri movement.
Two movement three the beginning of time, who thought of social media in 2012. in the year of black teenager Trayvon Martin killing after teemaviide #BlackLivesMatter, is homosexual.
"The lead role in the black homosexual women is the movement of the overall area of the store," said Ferrell, "and it is, therefore, that we must continually on many fronts to fight.
Black homosexual women need all this burden to bear."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement will keep indeed in the life of black women and many of them are black homosexual women".
He argues, however, that "it is not some sort of equal opportunities for the type of case" - Ferrelli is the selected movie, the focal point of his identity.
"He was a person, of whom radiated the right energy," he said.
"But it's not a coincidence that he was directly in the frontline in is located, because the black homosexual as a woman in such hubs living is a lot at stake.
His energy is possible through the screen to perceive."
At the same time, it is uudistekaamera of ferguson from the long-lost, but the racial ties to the community and the police involved are still very fragile.
Ferrellil of the demonstrations at the time of the road blocking for the specified probation penalty lasts for another 2.5 years.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere in the region, which he calls home, just "tohuvabohuks".
Nevertheless, it is still an important mantra, which he has etched in memory from the time when he as three years ago, ferguson's streets went.
"Our duty is to fight for their freedom.
Our obligation is to win.
We need each other to love and support.
We do not have to lose anything except our chains."

Start-ups that will help your company avoid the next Uberik of
Amy Errett wanted to measure your e-commerce start-ups in employee satisfaction, but the surveys were to no avail.
The answers were often vague, useless or, even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, did not trust some of the staff in this process.
"This system just wasn't consistent and objective," said Errett, who oversees 75 employees in San francisco operating in hair care products selling e-commerce company Madison Reed.
So he called on help from external persons.
Emerging is a new type of human resources are engaged in start-ups that help enterprises to find out what their employees feel.
Developing and licensing in the software, which the firm aims to measure workers ' involvement, they can allow businesses to make sudden loss of surveys, to take down certain teams, and demographic groups, to offer employees anonymity and a complaints hot-line, and in some cases allow keelekandjatele go along to the C-level leaders and appeal directly to the board.
"Now there are such tools like Strava" and the Fitbit, which is designed for health tracking, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and ceo of the Redwood City start-ups in a Glint, with no software analüütikatööriistu, companies are using employee engagement measurement.
Errett said he received a three-year period, when he is Glint using a much better insight into what it workers think and feel.
In addition äkkuuringutele and specific teams targeted survey, it offers the company's soojuskaarti, which gives an overview of this, in which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing him to find out the reasons.
Companies are starting to realize that they need to stay in touch with your workplace culture, in order not to become the next Uberik, which has been enmeshed in scandals in the from this, if the former employee published a blog recommendation, which describes the harassing environment, where penalties for those who dared to speak.
Such start-ups as Glint for an overview of owning a desire to a lucrative business opportunity.
Global management-, regulatory - and vastavusvaldkond may be in accordance with the financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments data by 2020. years worth more than 118,7 billion dollars.
Denver Colorado acting idufirma converce cause, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, observed this year uber of dubious reputation against the background of interest and activity growth.
Convercentil is almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber registered myself recently as a customer.
As glint no, let converce cause the companies to send custom impulssküsitlusi, collect real-time, confidential answers and to look soojuskaardi troubled areas.
It offers also anonymous sõnumsideliini, which allows employees to inappropriate behaviour reported.
And if relevant the ceo, go to the complaints directly to the board.
"Public opinion is usurped by the regulatory authorities," said Converce founder and ceo Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that if it is found that the company treats their employees poorly, or behave in a unethical manner, the company may face serious consequences, such as consumer boikotid, employee departure and lawsuits, even if the regulatory authorities did not interfere.
Ruby Tuesday, restaurant, which is more than 25 000 employees 500 sites, have used Converce more than a year, to ensure staff awareness of rules and operations, and to provide an easy way to corporate headquarters to communicate with.
If the employee wanted to in the past the problem reported, he had to find a corporate headquarters phone number or e-mail address to submit a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously.
It was often frustrating and inconvenient process, said Ruby Tuesday üldnõunik James Vitrano, who said there had been employee complaints to monitor a good way.
Now, when the company uses Converce, is, however, possible problems, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair palgapraktikad, which did not reach the earlier leaders, who were working in other cities or states located in the offices, the faster to detect and to deal with them.
"I be able to access closer to the workers to holistic 360-degree experience," said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday riskihaldusrühma.
"And we protect our shareholders in the litigation for employees."
Quinlan said that the companies began to ethical behavior, values and employee involvement to take much more seriously in 2002. year, perhaps after the auditing company Arthur Andersen crashed ethical violations in relation to the Enron scandal together.
But only then, when "social media became more mature", in understanding companies, that they cannot prevent their dirty laundry publicly on the web washing.
"Before the use of technology in ethical behaviour to monitor the use of people as a strategy of hope," he said.
So Glint as well as converce never offer their software as a service, taking companies of a periodic charge for their products use.
This is the business model and the chance of having venture capital investors ' approval, who has been a support to both start-ups.
Converce funding in February 10 million dollar to the extent such companies such as Sapphire Ventures in and Around the Capital, thereby raising the accumulated capital value of 47 million dollars.
Glint of invested in November, 10 million dollars, Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company's kogurahastus of 60 million dollars.
Such investments do not come as a surprise, if to take into account the business, culture and venture capital and the links between them.
More and more research shows that modern employees are waiting for job more than in the past.
Konkurentsirohke markets, such as the Silicon Valley, high salaries, and interesting projects merely on the board to the stakes.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they devote their time to the company, which has a positive mission.
"When people are in the company of happy, feel that they are being heard and that work, what they do is rewarding, they are more committed to the company's success," said Nina McQueen, who is the general benefits and workers ' experience of the department, vice president of linkedin in that uses both Converce as well as Glint.
Investors earn income when their portfolio companies are doing well; businesses are doing well, if employees are committed and involved.
If the third party analüütikatööriistad promise to increase the workers commitment and involvement, it is no wonder that they support.
Acquiring data of the employees involvement is the working culture of experts, according to importance.
However, these data are useless, if enterprise supervisor they do nothing.
In fact, it may, if a company asks its employees for feedback, to generate expectations, that are facing changes.
And if change is not happening fast enough or not at all, it can cause frustration and reduce staff involvement.
"If you ask 4000 proposal, you must be prepared to 4000 for the interview," said the consultation and ärihaldusettevõtte Kotter International president Russell Raath, who has seen how companies make the mistake of it to support too much data collection.
"Because if things do not refer to the end, then the employees will think: "Whether you actually took me to hear?
Do you care about?
And if you don't care, then why should I care?" "
Errett, Madison Reedil, who organized workers among the now once a month of research, been able to implement measures on the same day, if the problem is Glint through reported.
And after the decision-making speed and communication quality disappointed from the staff feedback was it possible in the company of several team re-organise and offer to deal with the challenges kommunikatsioonikoolitust.
Ruby Tuesdays will be collected but new data about the staff and it is hoped that in the long run, will this lead to employees ' long-term commitment to the industry, which is known for its high labour turnover.
"If you're not committed to transparency, then you lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose businesses."

When the camp is finished, change the UCLA workouts closed, which, however, is not an easy task, given the clear view of their squares to a nearby park and bystanders from luskin the centre, the senior class of the hotel, which has already become a hit väravapost of the surrounding panel of the along escaped jalgpalle with.
From this weekend occupy the hotel Bruins players, but Mora acknowledged that problems may arise in the free rooms with the seasons.

But we use the there and 8. park at the secure.
We give a existing using best.
I'll try this after the not especially to worry about.

Food had become.

It is also for this maize line varieties bred in southern areas and it may not be our climatic conditions in a suitable.
The foregoing insurance to get is the rural affairs commissioned in 2015. and in 2016. in studies of the potential of GM organisms for pollution detection in Estonia cultivated various spring swede rape, maize and soy varieties of seed.
Samples taken of the results of the analysis showed that the seeds võõrgeene did not contain and the study concluded that Estonia has grown oilseed rape, maize and soy varieties of seeds do not contain genetically modified organisms.
From the above can turn to conclude, that in Estonia is not grown deliberately genetically modified crops, and also received confirmation that there has also been accidental contamination.

Philippines wide world perhaps Õlgkotid trip moefännide heart
Straw woven bags are suveklassika, which has become in recent years a separate hitttoode, that one on the right suvenautleja on absolutely must be hand ends of the hang, and which is able to merchants of humble origin, despite the weld root hits the appropriate price tags.
Straw woven bag is probably one of such things, which is everyone times lives existed and which no special emotions aroused.
It simply is there and if not, then there is also something broken.
However, now there is õlgkotid doing a real triumph and moefännid is your fine disainerikotid changed the summer instead of simple straw plaited bags.
In doing so, it is not only rannakotiga, but today it is as popular also tänavakotina and encourage more women to walk around it even to the office.
It is worth however, before to make it clear whether the superior of such a summer look still, sitting or worth märmik and the laptop was still a little formal to a more sumadan of the slide.
Variety is õlgkottidest made but women in the real suvearmastuse.
For example, reading in a foreign moeblogi, then the first thing to remain blind eye to this, that moegurmaan the rush to the holiday trip first thing in the local market and purchase yourself some õlgkotid, which then healthy leave their periods of professional faithful they are and which goes with a beach, market and also girlfriends in the city on the top of the hang out.
Some bloggers are even so generous by buying a market bag a larger pile of and sell or give away them to your loyal readers.
In doing so, it is worth noting that the bag is read of among the demand is so high, that in the real world go to women (and men!) probably by the hand to each other to get to a bag of happy get owned.
In some sense, this madness also understandable, because rare are those times when moeilma is able to afford a few hitistaatusesse risen thing to buy all from a few tens of euro.
True, clever merchants have discovered at this point, also easy to rahateenimisvõimaluse and so selling the finer luksusbrändid õlekott also a few hundred and a thousand euro.
Probably still in order, that the wealthiest customers should not end lihtsurelikena know who any cheap bag with round promeneerib.
For example, it is possible to afford to buy the Dolce & Gabbana over a thousand euro paying õlgkotid.
Chanel the õlgkotid interpretation of the charge may, however, come up with 6000 euro in the round.
Unlike most moehittidest, does not come from the õlgkotid but far from some of the great moemekast, but their story began quite a distance.
Namely, from õlgkotid supposedly quite far from the Philippines, from where they extended without wear.
Straw bag braiding is there a particular eksporiäri and local to them around ongoing very often do not see.
Allegedly comes from the õlepunumistehnika 14. century and is quite sarane normal korvipunumisega.
However, because of õlgkotid do not need so strongly woven as a basket, can be those embedded in the musterid and other materials, which make the bag personal and this points also aktraktiivsemaks.
For example, in the recent time, especially in the trendy bags, which are in braid colored ribbons or nahkriba.
Letter of thanks may õlgkotid particular send but actress Jane Birkinile, of whom the greatest plaited õlgkotifänni had not before seen.
Namely, the suit he was õlgkotid all kinds of garments at, nor had to multiply it even the Cannes film festival to go to.
Bags popularity at the nowadays, do not play less of a role but also that their care is kukepea and unlike all kinds of other sumadanide does not need these special tools to maintain, just a matter of time also prevent the water and wet a towel.
As trendiröögatus, still, is apart from the classical looks to be the brands out of all kinds of interpretations.
For example, may wish to afford to acquire straw braid ridikül or instead of a tiny shoulder bag.
Keep in mind, however, that the classic õlgkotid do not go never out of fashion, õlgridikül but though.
But, what is then the classic õlgkotid?
Already for centuries is the classic considered the kind of straw braid bag, which is reminiscent of their style from the basket, is the top open and this is a short, as well as straw, straps.
