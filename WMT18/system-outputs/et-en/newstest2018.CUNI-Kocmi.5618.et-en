Four members of the Kemerovo Group were arrested in Estonia and Spain
According to Mr Postimehe, the so-called Kemerovo Group leader in the Estonian Channel, known as 'Slava Kemerovsk', was detained by the police in Spain under the name of Slovaks in the criminal world.
Mr Gulevitš, who was detained in Spain, was arrested on trial.
Yesterday, the Court also arrested three suspects detained in Estonia.
The suspicion is that they are members of the so-called 'Kemerovo criminal association' between the ages of 27 and 57, which mainly commit drug crime.
In the Spanish province of Malaga, Mijas, the alleged head of a criminal organisation was arrested.
Three men were arrested in Estonia, one of whom is a member of a criminal organisation, according to data collected, and two are members of a criminal organisation.
The data collected indicate that there was a clear division of tasks and roles within the criminal community.
The aim of the criminal community's activities was to commit drug offences and thereby generate criminal proceeds," commented Vahur Verte, the head of the pre-trial criminal proceedings.
'We do not rule out an increase in the number of suspects in this criminal case,' added the prosecutor.
These are people who, in the past, have found themselves in the clutches of the law enforcement authorities, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues had been essential throughout the investigation.
'International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation demonstrates the success of this cooperation', commented Public Prosecutor Verte.
The head of the Central Criminal Police Service, Ago Leis, said that the arrests had been preceded by a preliminary investigation lasting almost one and a half years.
'In the first half of the week, the long-term work took place and, at the same time, we apprehended suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain', he said.
It considered that the officers of the Central Criminal Police were instrumental in the arrest in Spain.
For years now, we have been in good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These arrests are yet another message to the criminals that we are going to get them from the other side of Europe," said Leis.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that, when released, suspects can continue committing new crimes, which is why the prosecutor's office asked for their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting his extradition to Estonia.
In this criminal case, real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial procedure for a criminal case is conducted by the Office for Organized Crime in the Central Criminal Police and is led by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In 2005, the City Court of Tallinn found Slava Gulevitch guilty of blackmail and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was regarded as the second most important man in the criminal world in Estonia, after the then Undersecretary Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevitš from Kemerovos stood up in the Estonian Channel at the beginning of the 1990s, when he began to engage in blackmail in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxis and prostitutes at various hotels and ordered a monthly levy on businessmen.
International joint operations, the confiscation of criminal assets and the entry into force of judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the most recent judgments, the so-called 'Dikayev Crime' case against eight suspects confiscating €80,000 of criminal proceeds, or the sentence against nine persons in respect of the creation in 2006 of Igor Aleynikov a criminal organisation targeting the illicit trade in cigarettes and trafficking in human beings in eastern Estonia and southern Estonia.
The proceeds of crime seized are close to EUR 71 500.
Progress in these criminal cases has been ensured by police officers exchanging information and evidence with their foreign counterparts on a daily basis and, if necessary, carrying out actions together in any country of the European Union.
Citizens' rights group warns against travelling to Missouris
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouris against discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The group statement reads: 'The NAACP travel note issued for the State of Missouri, valid until 28 August 2017, calls on all African passengers, visitors and missounders to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious as they move around the State as a whole, in view of the entirely dubious racial events that have taken place recently in the State and have also been brought to light here'.
According to NAACP, the group has been urged to issue a travel warning both by the recent Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination, and by the fact that the targets of law enforcement officers in the state are, to an unequal extent, the minorities.
'People's civil rights are being violated.
They are dressed in a pretence because of their skin colour, beaten or killed," said Rod Chapel, President of NAACP Missouri, to The Mirek s City Star.
'We have never received so many complaints before'.
This is the first such warning issued by an organisation against a US state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults against black students at Missour University and the death of the 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died half-way this year, in suspect circumstances, after he ran out of a state bench and was arrested by the Missouri police without being charged with the crime.
In addition, a comment refers to a recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Missour, which shows that in the state, the cars of black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped than those of white-skinned drivers.
'The note is intended to make people aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missour,' said Chapel.
'People must be prepared, whether it means taking in a supermarket building or informing relatives that they are going to cross state.'
According to the latest information from the FBI hate crime notification programme, in Missouris in 2015, 100 hate crimes were documented, placing the state in the 16th place in the country for similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to Missour's new law which makes it more difficult to take a company to court for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel remarks about Texas and Arizona after these states adopted immigration laws obliging local people to arrest people for immigration offences because, according to ACLU, this increases racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about other countries, but recently interest groups have begun to use this measure as a response to certain internal US laws and trends.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or cirrhosis of the liver, can be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses cause an acute burning of the liver disease.
However, at an irregular cost, chronic B and C hepatitis can develop into cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer.
The Health Officer's epidemiology adviser, Mr Kutsar, tells us that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver infection - fever, fatigue, content, vomiting, chewing, diarrhoea, grey worms, dark uride, meat and excessive pain, and leather and perfume.
The most recent disease is also caused by the popular name of the liver burn: coltan.
Children can have hepatitis without suffering from disease.
The different types of liver infection can only be identified on the basis of laboratory research.
Suddenly hepatitis can turn into chronic hepatitis and gold for decades without a symptom, which means that a person may not know anything about his dangerous liver-damaging disease.
The famous Kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us in eating contaminated food or drinking water, sex, discarding the infected person into their arms and hands on food, surfaces, items, sounds and consumption of drugs.
A risk of hepatitis infection - that is, family members and carers who are at risk, people suffering from chronic liver diseases, people who are sexually affected, men, drug addicts, travellers visiting countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Nanoscience can be prevented by vaccination, in particular, vaccination is recommended for people who travel a lot and are at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, daily compliance with hygiene requirements is important: to wash or disinfect your hand, before you wash all fruit and vegetables for food.
B hepatitis viruses are spread in the presence of sick people's blood, in injections of drugs, in spraying, in augmentation, in the use of blood-contaminated strawberries (toothbrushes, pregnant molluscs), in blood, in sex with hepatitis, and from hepatitis to foetus/newborn.
B The at risk of hepatitis infection include injecting drug addicts, sex partners of infected persons, men sex sex sex sex sex sex sex, the newly-infected mother, sick family members and carers, health care workers and policemen exposed to blood and other body weight, and travellers to countries with a high level of hepatitis.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, people can be vaccinated; in particular, people at risk, as well as people with chronic liver diseases, HIV infections, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes, are recommended.
B. Other prevention measures include: refraining from the use of exotic hygiene and manicure devices, other therapeutic devices and needle-stick techniques, refreshment and enhancement, and the use of condoms for the risk of infection, or avoiding sexual risk behaviours.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the National immunisation Plan in Estonia and free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread when a person is exposed to blood, during injections of drugs, spraying, augmentation, the use of blood-contaminated strawberries, blood from the donor, sex with the hepatitis, and from the hepatitis patient to the foetus/newborn.
The at-risk group of hepatitis C infections is inhaled drug addicts, sex partners of infected people, male sex sex sex entrants, newborn babies of infected mothers, sick family and carers, health care workers and policemen exposed to blood and other bodily injuries, people living with HIV infections and travellers with hepatitis C.
Hepatitis C preventive measures are: refrain from using foreign hygiene and Manichean instruments, other therapeutic tools and needle-stick techniques, refreshment and enhancement, and use of condoms for the risk of infection.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by hepatitis D, which multiplies in the presence of hepatitis B.
This is the case with hepatitis D infection combined with hepatitis B or hepatitis B chronic patients as a super infection.
Hepatitis D infections spread in contact with blood and other body parts, with contaminated needles, sexually and infrequently infected mothers in the foetus.
The at-risk group for hepatitis D is chronic B hepatitis virus predators and people with no anti-hepatitis B immunity.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination against hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from being infected with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses spread by foetal oral through drinking water and food, including low levels of heat-treated meat, fish and shellfish, donor blood, common hydrocarbons and more infected foetuses.
Passengers can be infected by the high level of E-hepatitis in the countryside.
Measures to prevent hepatitis E include meeting hygiene requirements: washing or disinfecting hands after going into toilets, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Fruits and vegetables must be washed before consumption, low consumption of heat-treated beef, fish and seafood must be avoided, safe drinking water must be provided and drug consumption must be avoided.
While in the last round competitors tried to get the four-time Olympic winner off the road, the 34-year-old Farah band found strength and won 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long ago, drawing his wife Tania and his children on the road after finishing.
This was a special moment for me.
I have a lot of fun with my family.
It was wonderful to be on the path," said Farah to the journalists.
Farah will host the fifth tournament in London for 5 000 and 10 000 metres of golden duvet.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's 'Daam kullas. The exquisite story of the Klimti masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portree', goes far beyond the creation of one of the works of art in the late 19th century and in the early 20th century in the cultural life of Vienna.
But even more so in history.
It would perhaps have taken a heavier punch to get some of the honourable information out of hand, and a narrower topic would have been allowed to get more of an impact on the exceptional nature of the portal allowed in the title.
At the moment, there would be a kind of two books between some of the cables: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted by Gustaf Klimti and his painting 'Daam kullas', and a much larger and more wide-ranging history book of respected Jewish families and German occupation, with its knock-on effects in Austria.
The first third of the book takes the cultural life of Vienna in the middle of the bustling, and those who become embroiled in the Austrian capital can imagine how, more than a hundred years ago, life went around Ringstra or how all the heads of the Central coffee turned when the Klimt entered.
The concentration of cultural actors in one of the richest cities in Europe was high and, seeing the name familiar in the book, feels like a granddar culture culture.
However, the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a city where there was no cure for guilt and where Europe had the highest suicide rate is an example of this, as if there were nothing more to contribute to development.
Or perhaps, even so, every two-headed surface war adds colour to the cultural life of Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century.
The dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten people in Vienna had a cheese.
Adele's parents were also new-fans in Vienna, but by the time Adele got married twice by opening the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and by positioning Klimt for his famous paintings, his father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
Adelet, however, did not draw the whole glamorous life to which he belonged.
Looking at the 'Daami in gold', it is hard to believe that, towards the end of life, this great lady infected socialism and dreamed of travelling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order her husband on a portal from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
The client ordered 4 000 crowns at the time, a quarter of the price of a good location for the land.
The fact that in some portraits, the master's love model was suspected did not deter the sugar magnate.
As far as Adeles is concerned, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the modeller and the artist that emerged during the work continued until the end of their lives.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - 'Daam kullas'.
An exceptional story of the Klimti masterpiece, the Adele Bloch-Bauer portree," Warrak 2016, an English translation by Aldo Randmaa.
Immediately before work began with Adele, the Klimt had been in Ravennas San Vitale basili, and the researchers think that the splendid mosaics seen just there, the emperor Theodora, gave the artist the idea of turning a golden portree from Adeles into a mosaic coloured.
The climate presented its 'Daami Gold' in Vienna in 1908 and at the same time, in 1907-1908, another golden land was born 'Great'.
The similarity of the two women did not go unnoticed in the history of art.
How is Hitler linked to the story?
'I think I owe it to my friend, Klimti, to make his handshake available to the public', wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after the departure of the artist (The Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family's Klimti collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had made Adeles a sister.
In his Testing Library (Adele left in February 1925), he also asked the husband to leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimti landscapes to Austrian Galer.
She inherited her truths to the girls Maria and Luis.
One year after the Klimt had finished 'Austria Mona Lisa', attempts were made to get into the Academy of the Vienna Diet by the 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but failed on the drawing board.
Although, at times, Hitler's subsequent anti-Semitism was attributed to the fact that the Jewish professors did not receive him in academia, none of his examiners was actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of Austrian Galer, referred to in Maria Testament, had changed considerably by 1939 - it had become important to find pleasant works for the Nazi party from the rich Jewish Arts in Vienna.
Hitler's personal artistic wealth was also matched by some of the Adele's work at home, but not that of Klimti.
Sixty years after the Nazi art raid, a ten-year legal dispute between the Austrian Government and Bloch-Bauer's heirs began.
Let me just point out that, when the 'Greater' is seen in the Belvedere Castle in Vienna, the 'Daam gold' depicting Adele Bloch-Bauer must be viewed in Neue Galer, New York.
And before going to Vienna, read the book.
Even if you do not plan to look at the work of the Klimti, because my emotions, at least, after the book was closed, revolved more over Nazi and Jewish issues than over USD 135 million and over modell Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So it is not so much a portrait, rather a tribal history - and a very moving story.
The Bauer genital tree, which was named at the beginning of the book, greatly facilitated the orientation of events.
17-year-old swimming pool in Canada was very close to Estonia's record
In the previous edition, Gold himself was 200 m in a very close proximity to his personal record of swimming 2.16.62.
The Summit dates from 17-year-old Bishops a week ago, when the Canadian June championship introduced 2.16.58, Priit Aaviku's UGod blog.
Gold finally reached the tenth A-finale.
In the film, he went through a remote distance of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh position with a new powerful top mark.
The Estonian record of Alina Kendzioril (2.15.13) left Gold for just over half a second.
In Estonia's age-old ranking, Gold rose third, and his fresh, personal top mark is the fifth result of Estonia's entire history.
There is still a glimmer of hope at the Canadian championship of adults, which is about to start 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in free swimming and 200 m and 400 m in complex swimming.
Last week in Toronto, Canada held its June Football Championships, and Gold made successful start-ups there as well.
He won 200 m in free soapbox with 2.03.22.
This distance was flooded so quickly as a result of the last flood in 2008.
In Estonia, only Estonia's Record Elina Partkas has switched this distance faster than Gold.
Under the leadership in Canada, the pronksmeda won a further 100 m in freefall, with an excellent personal record and a new Estonian peak of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than him, has switched this distance by only one century.
He reached a Personal Excellence in another 100 m spin-offs at the opening of the theatre season, 1.03.69.
At a distance of half, he achieved only the seventh place when swimming in the final of 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian seasonal ranking in four different distances.
President Trump goes on holiday, critics beat their teeth
The holiday season is upon us; it is also a time of indulgence for US President Donald Trump.
However, as Trump has so far been one of the President who has taken the most holiday days, critics are already teetering.
In the US, today, and in the CNN, the President is planning a 17-day holiday in the property-owned golf club in Berüster, in New Jersey.
Although the President's holiday started yesterday, opponents of Turkey have already spoken about the holiday week.
They are giving Turkey too many holidays.
Specifically, it is the President's custom to spend the weekend's holidays in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villages.
Incidentally, Trump has not been the most outspoken President in his 196 days in office.
For example, George W. Bush has already been on holiday for 67 days, while Barack Obama has been on less than Trump for only 21 days.
However, in Turkey, things tend to quickly become forgotten.
A few days after becoming President, Trump said '60 minutes' that there would be no time for long holidays in his official capacity, because a great deal needs to be done.
He also protested about Barack Obama's leave three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time: 'While Obama is on holiday, is playing golf, is attending festivals and junior priests, ISIS journalists are cutting their heads'.
According to the white House officials, a 17-day visit by a golf club is no fun.
It is officially referred to as a work holiday, during which Trump has no time for reading or other pleasure.
In addition, there had to be another reason for joy.
Namely, the counting system in the Western Wall is being replaced and, as a result, all the staff had to leave.
The Western Channel is also hosted by Ovaalkabinet and other presidential offices.
'I do not believe that any of you would like to be in the west of August with 38 degrees and no conductor', said Lindsay Walters, the Speaker of the White House, who stressed that the President would continue to work during the holiday.
A video will tell you where President Trump will spend the next 17 days.
Blocking critics from Facebook  do not stand for public office unless you put up with the critics' critics
The father of our country knew a lot about unfavourable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for the newspapers to start dabbling him for everything from internal politics to his political principles.
He was, of course, irritated by the criticism.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because, in 1783, Washington said that 'freedom of expression may be taken away from us and, dark and silent, we may be led to massacres like sheep'.
This brings me to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who will have to make an effort to be more Washington-like.
The posters of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page have been blocked and deleted by Hogan's subscribers.
And towards the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union has therefore taken it to court.
The official of the Governor dismissed the action and web-based reporting events drew from the reactions in the style of 'Who is interested?'.
'This is just Facebook', many said.
But it does matter.
And it matters a great deal when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an astonishingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state.
His approval percentage is the second highest among the 50 principals of the country.
The alarm is not a knee-jerk reaction.
He has led the State firmly and adhered strictly to his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook rather poorly as a key tool in his dealings with his constituents, for example by presenting his chicken's head after chemical warehouses for the first time.
Thus, the Governor's page  which is a public forum with official markings administered by staff paid by taxpayers' dollars  blocking the people visiting is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
The Hogan spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the Governor's behaviour in an interview given to The Washington Post, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it is too easy to paint a picture of web surveillance, spammers or people filled with anger.
The Post spoke to quite a few people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that is what they are: people who communicate with their elected leaders; teachers, owners and priests, not internet controllers.
They all said that their comments were respectable, well thought out and not at all sweet.
Pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasising Hogan's Catholic traffic.
Lakshmi Sarma Raman, a lawyer from Maryland Bowie, did not incite hatred, but rather hate crime.
'I have politely commented that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news,' he wrote to The Post News in the comment room.
'Nor do I like the idea that when more people comment on the same subject, someone immediately dismisses it as a collective effort instead of acknowledging that it is a matter of great concern to a large number of citizens.'
What the Governor's official called a 'targeted spam attack', others would probably call 'public support'.
The Facebook era allows for easy matching of messages by simply blocking the critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the old days, when to do the same, workers had to be expelled to assemble newspapers with critical manuals and burn them or arrest protestors and force them to remain silent.
But that is exactly what is happening now, just digitally.
The Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for hammering Facebook and other social media.
President Trumpi has sued Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter.
One of the first landmark court rulings on this subject was delivered in Virginia last week.
The US Attorney General, James C. Cacheris, ruled in Alexandria that the Chairman of the supervisory council in the province of Loudoun violated the first revision of the constitution when he blocked the electorate from his Facebook page.
After using ACLU Facebook and Twitter, Kentuckys also visited Governor Matt Bevinit (R).
It should not be so difficult.
At Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, four times the number of newspapers and anonymous writers duped his management.
And even then Washington had to cope with anonymous controls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudo-mysteries such as Juricola, Valery, Belisarius and Portius, dismantling Washington's decisions.
According to the historical documents collected within the framework of the online collection project for George Washington's letters, he buried his office in petitions criticising his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Great Britain.
But he did not force them to remain silent.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are fundamental pillars of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes Renaissance Clubis for comfort on home territory
Ronan Rafferty, formerly Europe's number number one, is counting on the comfort of his home territory for the next three days, while the East Lothiani Renaissance Clubi golfirates will host the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
A Northern Irishman who was in the vicinity of Archerfield Line last year in the run-up to Paul Eales's descent is attached to the new venue and plays the role of Reverend Ambassador instead of Jerry Sarvadi, the founder and executive of the club.
"I saw Renaissance Clubi built, and now we see the club shining in full swing with this event,"
"Lawyers see the trail in its best form, it is in a brilliant state.
Jerry has done an excellent job in establishing this place.
He is a fervent supporter of the golf convention and is proud of what has been achieved here.
This will allow us to present the path excellently."
She looks forward to being able to defend the championship for the first time, even though she has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during her 32-year career.
'This is a very special feeling,' said the player washing in Southport.
"I could not defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken down a year after my victory in the competition calendar.
It is magic to get back to this pot.
This is an excellent place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, and for me and my wife, Sharon, last year's victory was a special one.
It was a very special time, which we will always keep in our hearts.'
On the surface of the home, Gary Orr, who joined the European tuna of seekers around the start of this year when he got 50, will also return to the contest.
This is his first event in Scotland since Aberdeen Asset's participation in Scottish Open in 2013.
'The home to play is always a bit more meaningful,' said Helensburgh's man Orr.
'You want to do well, but you also feel the pressure.
I have enjoyed playing again enormously and demonstrated a rather decent golf course.
I am happy with how things have gone so far."
In Trio, the former Masters turniir winner Ian Woosnam and the ceremonies for the ceremonies, Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty will join.
Orr and the former Ryderi Captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the competition, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Access is free, and car parking costs a passenger GBP 5 and a passenger of GBP 10.

Poverty and death on Indonesian gold-plated land
When Bardina Degei is preparing his dinner, he does not use lead.
It even rarely uses a pot.
In a wooden house located in the capital of the Indonesian province of Papua in the Paniai, in the Channel, a housewife instals a battery called 'nota' in the local language directly into the fire.
After half an hour, a chicken is taken from a fire with a chicken's tail and the skin is pulled up with the bathwater's hand.
Degei sits on the floor of the mud  he has no furniture  and, at the same time, performs his day-to-day housework, such as washing the ash water from the warmth near the washing water.
The cargo is performed by the tank without the roof.
As she is the youngest of her husband's four, she is not appointed to take care of any field.
Pollution is commonplace here.
Late work, however, can be dangerous  most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, as well as soldiers.
'Nobody dares to go around in the village after five o'clock in the evening,' he says.
This is a rare sight to be seen in Papua Mountain, a colony of the former Dutch colony that was brought under Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, during which only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote by the hands of the occupying forces.
The Dutch movement for liberation from domination has been rushing into its rage against the Jakarta Government, which is still keeping the region under its strong control by keeping away foreign journalists and human rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, leaving the eastern part of the island to independent Papua New Guinea.
To get there, you have to fly from the provincial capital, Jayapura, from 90 minutes to Nabire, and then go through a five-hour journey that will delay the rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city, with around 19,000 inhabitants, is made up of wooden houses surrounded by fences from the base and covered by fertile iron roofs, which have turned the different strains into yellow wings.
Very few industrialists have taken the journey here, not to mention journalists, and there have been hardly any foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Mee Pago worshipped the god Uga Tamee.
There were also other changes.
'We were not used to wearing such clothes,' says Degei, referring to his coloured cousin, dark prosthes and err mushrooms.
'Prior to that, we only carried the flora'.
Poor is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy are among the worst in Asia.
But it is also the golden land of Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Panias, a mountainous province of about 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world is Grasberg, which belongs to the company Freeport McMoran in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted some USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua can be boasted of commercial timber stocks, which are estimated at USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering for the Pope, as they lead to the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesian army.
A study by the New York Times in 2005 showed that Freeport paid around USD 20 million to local military personnel and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to USD 150 000 for a single victim.
The efforts of the refugees to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gold and are being carried out relentlessly.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacre in the Pacific tribes in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, more than 3 900 peaceful protesters were arrested in the Indonesian police area.
The Birsbane Archbishop's 2016 report 'We will lose everything' contains testimony to the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (rape and electric shocks, according to another report) and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
'The number of victims is hard to read, as such incidents occur every week,' says Andreas Harsono, the researcher of Human Rights Watch Indonesia.
The crises have been increasingly closed down because Papua natural resources have caused the influx of neo-settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demography is changing, as Muslim economic migrants are arriving from the Indonesian islands of Jaava, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Breakers' family dinners sell gado-gado with clothing and mixed vegetables, which are served together with peanuts.
Local people are unable to compete with them.
'Migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market at a lower price than local tanks,' explains Abeth You, born in Paniais, who moved to the provincial capital, Jayapura, for work.
'St. Petersburg Popes  Poppy Mama-Mama's [women]  therefore lose their market share.'
In his 2014 election campaign, Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia, known as Jokow, pledged to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Pacific.
The former carrot won his way to the Jakarta Presidential Council from the 29 constituencies of Papua, 27 of which included Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua and the local people feel let down.
"Our hearts have been shattered, because in 2014, we voted for Jokow in the expectation that he would fulfil our hopes for the restoration of justice,"
In fact, just two months after Eaow took office in October, Paniai was in a low position.
On 7 December 2014, 11 children in the Channel song on a Christmas break, while two Indonesian soldiers were squeezed out of the darkness.
The children in the court told them that they should include the front lights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Teba, one of the soldiers was insulted to their tone and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and spectators, drunk soldiers drove children and beat them with their arms held.
Then one of the soldiers fired on children.
A child, Yulianus Yeimot, aged 16, was so brutally beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby Electoral Commission building was burnt down and things escalated the following day.
Around 1 000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in a football pitch in front of the local police and military command centre to demand justice.
They weared ceremonial jackets and presented a Pope's bag with a waita dance, drink round and bury poultry.
Some protesters started to throw stones at the police and the military.
During the escalation, the soldiers were sent an order via internal radio: 'If the crowd shows resistance more than three times, let them down', according to an official document, which has been seen by the TIME magazine, but which has not been released to local media publications.
Yeremias Kayame (56), a senior member of the Municipality of Kego Koto in the Enarotal city, felt threatened and called for peace to be maintained by asking the population to go home.
No one had the will to listen.
'By turning around, I was suddenly shot into a left beach,' he said, in the TIME magazine on the verge of a wooden house in his inflated colours.
The Kayame still does not know who the fireman was, but says that the soldiers gathered a month came from the ranks.
'There was plenty of people, there was plenty of room,' he adds.
Alfius Youw, a local man, was horrified to see him shot three times.
'Jooks on him and I searched him through the body to make sure that he was with him,' said the magazine TIME synonymous on Yohan, which, like many indoners, uses only one name.
'I saw that he is dead... I have grasped him.'
Yotje Mende, the chief police officer, told reporters that he was only subject to the security of his department because he was attacked.
'We must protect ourselves if we are threatened with killing,' said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, spokesperson for the Papua police in 2015.
'This is a matter of life and death'.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the killings only reached Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapura delivered a passionate speech, expressing sympathy to the families of the victims and allowing abuses in Pacific to be dealt with.
'I want to solve this case now so that it never happens again in the future,' he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to deal with the crimes against human rights that have taken place.
But almost immediately, the excuses followed.
'Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes,"
However, when talking about TIME on 5 June in Jakarta, Wiranto took back his words by saying that he had no intention of setting up a mechanism in Pacific to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said 'everything will be done according to the law'.
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1 000 people in East Timor during the bloody referendum on independence in 1999, said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been solved in Pacific, including in Paniaa.
The families of the Bank's victims adopted such claims with dismay.
'I have been listened to four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made,' said Yohan.
'I am tired.'
He says that many years later, he still lives in fear.
'I am afraid,' she says.
'I am afraid the army will arrest me, I am afraid I will be shot.'
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view that the Paniac people are afraid to resolve this incident.
He said that he had been beaten by the army after he had helped to bury four victims.
'After burying the dead bodies, the army came to seek me,' he says.
Smoking has not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in Deiyais, neighbouring Paniai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when a war took place between residents of a village and the head of a construction company, who refused to transport an unconscious man to a hospital.
This man, a 24-year-old drug Douw who drowned fish in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Vihased villagers protested at the building site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the residents of the village created police officers with stones, which the latter responded to with warning signals.
However, according to local claims, mobile brigades (the Indonesian military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
'We were in great panic, we are afraid of retaliation,' said the journal TIME 29-year-old Domingo Badies, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured in the entrance.
'I have been hiding in my house for two days.'
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the police officers involved to be held accountable and for the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the region.
Bank has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development fuels the dissatisfaction of the honey, many, dani and damn tribes living in the poorly maintained middle mountains.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL)  rebel army, which, in its own words, defends the rights of the Pope by carrying out random attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the VPL's leaders come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of 'defence of national sovereignty', the army has, over recent years, arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in Pania.
Some of them never appear again.
Among the poor people, the Paniac is known as 'a tragic forgotten place'.
Poverty fuels dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in the Enarotal is too expensive for local shopping.
It is just as inaccessible.
People grow all their food themselves  mainly batteries, in addition to a little fruit and vegetables.
Breeding education is the work of women, each of whom is able to maintain four or five types of battery life.
They usually keep most of the harvest to their families, while the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten batteries cost only 10 000 Indonesian squares (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequalities between indigenous fleets and new migrants, who have come in abundance since the opening of new routes at Nabire Airport, have become more pronounced.
The few jobs that exist go to better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Passengers themselves often lack capital or the necessary skills to run a competitive business.
'Young people are not interested in staying on the sidelines because there are no jobs and there is no money,' says John Gobai, Chairman of the Banking Council.
Segregation keeps the world's eyes off Pacific.
In addition, the external dimension remains severely restricted.
At the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Paapua because 'they did not follow the relevant practices', even though they had been given a rare authorisation to film.
Mr Phelim Kine, Deputy Chairman of Human Rights Watch's Asia Department, has stated that Jokow's election pledges to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
'In Indonesia, journalists trying to report on the most troubled provinces in the east of Papua and Western Papua are facing new threats  visa rejection and blacklisting,' he said in the statement.
The fact that there is a lack of media scrutiny means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely confined to its immediate neighbours in Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries  Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Saalomon Saared  were urged by the UN Human Rights Council to investigate 'various widespread crimes' in Pacific, including the shooting of Pania.
The VPL has also been historically supported by these same countries.
Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dismissed the group's accusations, saying to the journalists in Jakarta: 'There is still democratic order and freedom of the press in Indonesia, so that the evidence of human rights violations is difficult to bury'.
The local people want more foreign governments to take notice of.
When the Dutch official delegation, headed by the Dutch human rights ambassador, Kens Van Bavaria, visited Jayapura on 4 May, the local people interrupted their silence, according to the gentleman who was there but wanted to remain anonymous, urging: 'We want freedom'.
There will be new presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019, but the Powers do not believe that they will again vote in favour of Jokow.
'Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in shooting Paniai,' says Mr Hobai, President of the Council of Ministers.
He wants to impress upon Jokow not only that the Paniac people are constantly living under the threat of a predatory army, but also that they are suffering from squalor-brained educational and health services.
In the words of Goba, the Paniac people, like other boat people, consider their vote for Jokow to be a debt that they have to pay.
'They do not need money; they want justice,' he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting at Paniai coped with the latest symbolic rebellion  they buried the body of one of the victims in the police station and in the land opposite the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be done, at least those responsible will not be allowed to forget their crimes.
'One of our family members was killed,' says Yacobus with a fallen head.
'What else can we do?'
Dubai Torchi's cloud has been absorbed by fire for the second time in a row
The fire swept through one of the world's highest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of people to flee from that 337-metre height and 79-metre structure.
This is the second fire which, in just two years, has devastated what is, incidentally, called the Torchi Tower.
Buildings were evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of fire was presented.
'We slept and woke up to the fire alarm and the shouting of the people.
We ran down the treadmill and it took around 10 minutes from the 50th floor floor," said one of the residents of Reuters, who called himself George.
According to Dubai civil defence officials, the fire-fighters removed the flame at around 4 a.m. local time (00 GMT) and hunted the building.
The government said that they were working to provide shelter for those affected.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of high-performance non-terrestrial materials all over the world.
An investigation conducted by the Torch Bureau in the wake of the 2015 fire found that the greatest damage was suffered by the Fascists - the outdoor decorators and the isolationism.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of Grenfell Tower in London and its fascist panels may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June, in which nearly 80 people were killed.
Look: these phones are expected to become vending machines in the autumn
Lighting and autumn is the time for the technical fans, because then the phone manufacturers will disclose their new model of excellence.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium entered the market, while in the autumn, new hi-telephones are expected to appear on the shelves.
According to Kristjan Seema, Director of Tele2 Marketing and Sales, thumbs are characterised by an innovative design, an eye-catching machine, a minus-servant 4K resolution on the screen and an extremely fast procedure.
Samsung Galaxy S8, also at the forefront of the Estonian smart phone sale ranking, is a major electric power in the world of technology.
In the autumn, the smart-minded will be able to recharge even more quickly, have more durable batteries, a better quality camera and more water and dust security.
He added that it was already possible to make assumptions and to predict four top models, which will probably invade today's sales tables.
These four smart phones' top models will be on the shelves in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to reach their pockets already in mid-September.
You hear what the new Apple model looks like and what it can do.
If iPhone 7 did not bring any significant differences between iPhone 6s, Apple's 10th birthday is expected to be completely different from previous ones.
Four colours have been spoken of: black, white, rosé gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen covering the whole front-of-line, the home button has been removed and the fingerprint reader has been installed on the screen.
The designer director of Apple, JonyIve, is demanding that the new iPhone model look like a flash glass.
There has also been talk of the beggarly version of iPhone.
In addition to an exhaustive camera, free recharging and even better quality camera, the A11 procedure can be expected to be faster.
It is definitely one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
The new model, Galaxy Note 8, will begin on 23 August.
There have been many rumours as to what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It is said that even more business users are meant, and S Pen allows even more functionality.
There should be two cameras on the telephone, one of which is a wave and the other a TV spot with a narrow view.
No one is yet aware of what two grey cameras are capable of, but in any case this is Samsung's first test, which is certainly comparable in terms of quality to iPhone 8.
However, we look forward to 23 August.
Although Nokia has this year sold three smart phones with Nokia 6 at the head of Nokia, there is still a lack of their flagship, Nokia 8, which is already on display on 16 August.
We are expecting a screen from Nokia stretching from 5.3 customs to the periphery and a very fast Qualcomm Snapdragon to 8 35 procedures and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of the aluminium stock and the significant degree of water and dust security IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two grey cameras produced by the company Zeiss.
While Sony's firm flagship has so far been XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative functions will be added in the near future.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is slightly more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
A new model of Sony has been speculated on, with at least 6 customs on its screen.
We can see the reality soon, because traditionally Sony has unveiled its autumn flagship at the IFA, which this year runs from 1 to 6 September.
According to the transcriptions leaked by telephone, Trump pressed Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post disclosed the transcriptions of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian heads of state.
On 27 January, the Trump phone addressed the Mexican President, Enrique Pena Nieto, to end the public proclamation that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American President praised him for publicly condemning the wall, saying: 'You cannot say that to the press'.
Trump set up his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall along the United States' southern border and the promise that it would make Mexico pay for this project.
Transcriptions were also published from his first speech to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which reveals an intense exchange of views.
Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement whereby the United States would take in refugees who are heading for Australia is 'ridiculous', 'nervous' and 'stupid'; he said that the agreement reached under the Obama Administration would leave him with the impression of 'chance' by proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump ended his speech by informing Turnbull that 'this was the most unpleasant speech of the day'.
The national court did not consider the complaint lodged by the OJ MRP Linna Leaks in the case where the city of Tartu rejected their offer to procure a bus service between July 2019 and 2029.
This is the order book that rejected the offer by the OÜ MRP Linna on the Tartu Bus Procurement because the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, President of the Legal Service of Tartu City.
It is a public service service service service for the city of Tartu for the period from 01.07.2019 to 30.06.2029.
The MRP Linna League appealed to the Supreme Court for a decision on the Tartu District Court.
It was not taken to court in the national courts.
While many in the social media complain that the noise from the Weekend Festival upsets their nights and the whole city is full of brakes, there are many who have no words of bad news about the festival that is going on in the coast.
I am even positively surprised that the shops were so polite!
I did not see any ambiguity or any lack of courtesy.
Even I saw the divorce,' says Laine.
'It is nice to come, to be and to be glad to see the sun, which is winter like the winter hour,' he says gladly.
The troublesome Punch Laine und from the shores does not bother.
While living in the city centre, he was still hearing that music was being played on the beach, now the music has not reached his home walls.
'But I hope I hear', he says gladly.
Agnes, who spoke at the weather page, also says that the Grand Festival is rather good for Pärnu - after all, it is a great help for local merchants.
In addition, he is delighted that there has been so much layout in the summer resort.
The woman is not disturbed by the noise of the players.
Although I will not go back to the beach any more, it is nice that the beach has been flowing.
And it is good that the people are moving, and it has already been three times as much," says the woman.
Perhaps the first time it was a little worse.
'There may have been complaints then', he ponders.
However, the noise at the beach is, as he says, common to summer birds.
'This Weekend is a very good promotional act for our small town', says Harri, who is being peered in the park.
Man and manure have not put his life in a magic wand either.
But then?!
We should all make savings.
Think how this inter-ethnic communication would be better.
A man of white music will not be crushed.
It does not interfere, although I live nearby.
'Good people can make savings and there is no resentment,' he says.
Visitors who have come to honour are, he says, courteous.
'They have exaggerated a little with the puppies, of course, but young people are young and old is God - let us go, but be people and we can do!' he says.
The coastal residents have travelled somewhere away by then, either to relatives or to acquaintances.
'But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like that noise,' says the Tiina of Pärnus, who walked with children.
His family's und festival is not disturbed either, although last year it turned out even further than this year.
Last summer, the stage was different, then we heard more.
We live outside the city so that we can actually get there far on the outskirts of the Pärnu River,' he says.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
The British education firm, Pearson, said on Friday that it will cut 3 000 more jobs and reduce its intermediate dividend by 72%, thus launching another restructuring programme to tackle the scarcity of business.
The job losses, which, according to the managing director, Mr Fallon, are likely to be at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, will be topped up with the 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
The Chief Executive announced in May plans to cut costs under the Third Reduction Programme by an additional £300 million ($394 million) to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid digital switchover.
The company that agreed to sell a stake in the Penguin Random House last month to its partner, Bertelsmann, said that their expectations for the year had not changed since the announcement of a 1% increase in sales revenue in the first half of the year, amounting to GBP 2.05 billion.
On Sunday, summer weather continues with rains
In Estonia on Sunday, with the possibility of a summer holiday with rainfall, the wind turbines are sometimes very strong.
The work will show up in a cloud in Estonia.
Several half a hundred rains can be rubbish.
Between 5 and 11 vessels burst the runway and the west, in the form of an outbreak of up to 14, on the islands and on the coast of up to 18 m/s.
The temperature is between 13 and 17 degrees.
The day will come when the weather will be alternate.
Several half a century of rain, it is possible to stay in a place.
It runs from 6 to 12, has been fired up to 15, on islands and coasts up to 20 m/s.
The temperature is between 18 and 21 degrees.
Attack in Kabul: a suicide attack killed a NATO soldier
The suicide bomber, according to officials, attacked military convoys in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
A NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were killed in an incident in the province of Qarabagh.
This bombing is the latest act of violence that has struck Afghanistan this month: on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed by the Herat mocratic attack.
On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul near the Iraqi Embassy.
NATO's statement said that the explosion on on Thursday evening took place when a joint orchestra with the Afghan army attacked 'a man-made explosive body'.
According to the statement, everyone has been injured in a stable condition and is being treated at the US military hospital in Bagram airport.
According to the respondents, the Taliban and the group known as the 'Islamic State' (ISIS), the growing power of Qarabag in NATO in Bagram, is a serious source of concern.
According to UN data, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, approximately 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people, mainly from Shi'ite areas.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the centre of the city - the most deadly military attack in the country since the US-led forces withdrew the Taliban from power in 2001.
This violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering increasing US military and police assistance.
According to the respondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA annulled the decision to postpone the decision to suspend the concession after the actions had been brought
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has annulled the decision to delay the implementation of the Obama Regulation, which obliges states to limit their emissions causing gases, one day after 15 states took the Agency to court for this move.
The EPA announced its decision to proceed with the '2015-procedure for assigning ozone content' late on Wednesday, saying that this demonstrates the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the states.
'We believe that we need to engage in dialogue and listening to our partners from the states,' said EPA Chairman Scott Pruit in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to postpone the designation of ozone concentrations  during which the measurement of indoor pollution in different parts of the country would be carried out to determine where this level should be reduced to meet the stricter air quality standard  by one year until October 2018.
The 15 principally democratic states, together with the Columbia district, lodged a complaint on Tuesday, saying that this decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has attempted to withdraw a number of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama, which, according to Trump, is part of a more comprehensive plan to boost economic growth.
However, these attempts have provoked reactions among the democrats and nature protection groups who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhaling the ozone-containing air 'may reduce the capacity of the lungs and increase the risk of contracting respiratory diseases', such as asthma.
German pigs can have a brake.
German pigs and bovine animals can be put on the brakes because heavy rains put the European Union's second-biggest wheat producer at risk, says Bloomberg.
This year, it may be the case that a week-long saga before harvesting can mean that a fruit intended for the food industry is only fit for animal feed.
'The quality of the wheat is far worse than that of the mum and worse than in 2015,' said Bernhard Chilla, the analyst of Agravis Raiffeni.
This year, up to 40% of German wheat can go into animal feed, which is double the normal number, projected in Agrav.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all sorts of weather this year.
First of all, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June was replaced by a hot spring.
In July, Germany was hit by a hormonal accident, which has also continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned on northern Germany, where rain prevents harvests.
So far only 5% of wheat has been harvested.
Most of the region has not yet seen its harvest fall, according to Ceravis, a local fish producer.
"This is a very difficult day," said Frank Deckert, Cenurse magazine, from Rendsburg.
In line with everything, perhaps the Finns' indoor shaping sophisticated chips
In the shops, nature plays its part in the interfaces of the fairs because, through the large windows, the comparable views of Saimaa's cliffs reach many (life) rooms.
At every turn, the aspiration of our northern neighbours to create homes that are both sparse and perfect (energy-efficient).
The ability of Finns to use wood as a construction and refining material, furniture and furniture is worthy of admiration and respect.
Misleading techniques and smart solutions can be found at the fairs by the builder as well as the (home) designer.
It clearly shows that mixtures of black, white and grey shadows, when they are supplemented by wood tones and stickers, can be very desperate.
Good ideas can still be learnt for a week, as the Fair will last until 13 August.
Supporters and shepherds imply that this kitchen is often cheated.
Ööld's voice was singled out today for the Weekend Festival Balticule, and Martin Garrix did everything he could to be reminded of as the last speaker.
The people were truly at a turning point when Garrix was speaking - laughing, hair-splitting, dancing wildly.
When Garrix stopped, a collective force sprayed across the city from the coast of Pärnu.
We are producing a blue gallery with all the images that our photographer tried for three days on Weekendi.
Surely you are in some of them, too, looking up!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are supposed to be on a collision course to meet up to 66.7 kg in the most exciting showroom in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in Los Angeles, in the ESPN office, until Garcia, the unrivalled World Boxing Council lighthouse, walked the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the melting pot of the World Boxing Organization.
Following Garcia's unanimous decision to win the former Fourth World Cup, Adrien Broner, on Saturday in Showtime, both fighters will be at the forefront of the barometer.
Garcia gave his better hand and said, 'How do you go, the champion?
I wish you every success."
Lomachenko will defend its belt against Miguel Marriage on Saturday evening at 19 ESPN.
When a couple of photographs were positioned, the Lomachenko mänedžer in Egis Klima stated that a possible confrontation between the combatants would be a 'perfect measure'.
'I am a former melting pot,' he reminded Garcia.
'I have moved for Broner [to 63.5 kg], but I am not so big.
I am small for 63.5 kg.
I want to go downwards.
And he has to jump the gun [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The FPs have asked for this.
Let us give them that'.
Mr Lomachenko agreed.
'The guerrilla world needs this fight'.
The climate raised the question of whether it should be cost-effective, as part of its strategy to allow Lomachenko to debut 61.2 kg in the classroom later this year in order to make a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 November) possible by next summer, which also has an interest in fighting the Iron Curtain and the Luke Campbell math, 23 September after they were divided.
'Looking at this fight could be worthwhile, because the fans have asked for this confrontation,' Garcia said later, 'it is open to fight on any channel offering the best financial package'.
"We are the key players.
No other name can attract so much attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said that he considered Lomachenko to be a 'forceful fighter' and he might go and look at his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia when he said that he thought that the champion of the three divisions from Riverside had seen 'very slow; sorry, Mikey... he wanted it very well'.
According to Garcia, the aim was to show flexibility and then to hang.
Both confirmed that they feel the tension growing between them in terms of prosperity.
'This is a fight that is waiting to be carried out.
No other confrontation attracts so much attention and agitation.
I am more than willing to work towards this," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: 'I have been waiting for the best combatants, and Mikey is precisely that.
It will be a good fight.'
Which regions of the world are being relocated to Estonia?
The model was extended and the Police and Border Guard (PPA) granted a record number of more than 13 000 residence permits to third-country nationals, mostly travelling to Estonia for work, study or family purposes.
If, for example, 6702 foreigners were to be granted a temporary residence permit, the figure was 4928.
The agencies cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia permanently, but such an analysis will be prepared within the Ministry of the Interior.
Ten years ago, when nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia annually, this figure is close to 2 000 in recent years.
The number of applications for a residence permit increased exponentially during the Ukrainian crisis, from 1087 in 2014 to 675 in the previous year.
According to statistics, the largest increase in the number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia was the arrival of 850 Ukrainian citizens in Estonia.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia and, due to the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural for work and learning opportunities to be sought in a country where the community and many families are already ahead," said Kristin Rammu, spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior.
The number of Ukrainians who were granted temporary residence permits was higher even than the number of Russian citizens, even though in ten years the largest number of temporary residence permits has been issued to the latter.
If the Ukrainians come to work here predominantly, then Russian citizens will come for family migration.
'Bearing in mind the historical Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the closest family ties to people living in Russia', said Helina Maasing, Migration Research Research Commissioner for the Interior Protection Academy.
'If you look at where the Russian citizens who have received an Estonian residence permit have moved to live, immediately after Khartoum there is East Virumaa', he added, and pointed out that about 40% of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
One hundred and sixty-six Russian citizens obtained a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians wishing to extend their residence permits fell.
'The reason for this is that, instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been requested for permanent residence in Estonia,' explained Rammus, spokeswoman of the Ministry of the Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit had remained stable for years.
Foreign nationals who have lived here for at least three years will be able to apply for a new residence permit to reside permanently in Estonia from the previous year.
It aims to encourage the retention of people who have adapted.
However, a residence permit for a long-term resident requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has also apparently been reduced as a result of the new residence permit.
For example, a similar residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years.
Ukrainians will now be able to change jobs, and the Estonian state will no longer apply the penalty of whether the salary criterion has been met.
This residence permit became popular at the moment: holders of a foreign hall passport (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36) converted into applicants.
A total of 1968 people were authorised to reside in Estonia for settlement, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
The total number of such applicants is already 1269 in the first half of this year.
In 10 years, Nigeria has surprisingly become one of the most active citizens applying for residence permits in Estonia.
While three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, 200 were granted.
Nigeria is coming to study here in universities.
Other Estonian higher education institutions are popular with, for example, Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of Indian, Bangladeshi and Nigerian citizens has risen largely as a result of school migration.
They are also subject to the rule that where a community has been born, it will be easier for others to come in," added Rammus.
For 10 years, two people have also moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, just as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If approximately 6 000 third-country nationals are granted residence permits per year, this represents around 0.46% of the total population.
Even if you include the citizens of the European Union, migration remains around a percentage," commented Maasing that, in fact, the numbers are small.
A total of 14 822 people were relocated to Estonia, compared to 13 792, according to the statistics office.
This means that immigration has surpassed the level of emigration for a second year.
The majority of outgoing and incoming immigrants are citizens of Estonia, but there are more of them among emigrants.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was affected by a deficit of 2 000 people.
Estonians are moving, in particular, between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture princess boasts of sations, ticks and carpets
There is, however, a history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and characters - in a basket of ideas: 'I can dream of a museum somewhere for hours and admire old thieves and cranes.
If you follow a path with passion, you can explore and learn about it on a daily basis.
It is a joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may look alien to some, but the designer does not think so.
You decide for yourself how much brick there is in life!
I have a friend who has a whole sauna full of couture stickers of the tombs I have created.
Because, and it is not his fault, he does not live in Hollywood and does not go to the red carpet every day, he also wants to wear the most beautiful stickers and he does!
You can live your own life as special!
The mosque does not recognise the gulf between shining events and the grey everyday day.
It was this reasoning that led to the plan to move the highs in Estonia to rural areas, between forests and fields, to people who are often not arriving in fashion.
Mammu's collectivity was presented, for example, in the English, Jewish and Pärnu mosaile, where a 45-modelled Queen's defilis filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, the shop is often picked up, dignified, but elsewhere there is more emotion - crippling Bravo, standing up, wanting to thank you in your arms.
A large part of the audience had to be queuing up, but now they are Mammu Couture fans.
When you exceed people's expectations, they are spirited!
And I like the feeling that I am on my molecule as if I am on a summer holiday.
We had a red carpet 50 metres long, full of clothes full of shops today, and it seemed that they would not have an end!
Maria also fails to recognise the fashionable need for creativity to be presented as a super-model, which she willingly brings to the stage ordinary women.
Often I invite my own customers to the stage - they have always been happy.
This is such a long experience, you can shine on the stage in a wonderful sticker!
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen my performance, I am always behind the stage of giving things the last sword as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nervousness would not allow me to sit back and watch the Chamber calmly.
Maria is the molecule of a kind that does not just want to play a representative role, but to be involved in everything.
I have my own apparatus in the Chamber, I carry out most of the collections myself.
I like the whole process of playing with details.
I am never far from my own creation, and I am not afraid of work.
Disappointment is not the end of the matter, including stylistic, logistics, organisation, organisation - everything has to fit in with a single day for a temperate woman.
There are still huge numbers of these unemployed coming from fanatics.
I cannot say when my working day will end; for me, it is just a day of joy!
I am still very lucky - it is like an endless cycle of happiness: I do something beautiful, the man gets something beautiful and the other compliments.
It has been said many times that there is land in my sticks - they make you feel princess.
The gaping ping ping satire that made the talent famous overnight by Maria talent has stayed for Mammu Couture signatures to this day.
Martin MMyrse U18 boys: the gun from the Estonic Subgroup group group is now turned against us
It is a pity that the fairy tale has run out.
The first thing that came to light was that we could not get our table in front of us.
And if there is such a big difference to be made on the table, there is nothing to be done," commented Martin Mymrsepp, our only NBAs player in Britain, commenting on the disappearance of the Estonian U18 Corps Plant 61:75.
The respondents took 28 balls from the offensive zone and suffered many more attacks as a result.
We were also not prepared for their aggressive defence or attack, it was created.
Many of the attacks by the British ended in three to five seconds; we were unable to build protection.
However, they were able to hold their hand everywhere; we could not combine.
It set the team on its feet.
Respondents had their homework improved.
According to an approximate estimate, Estonia would have had to make more tactical mistakes in order to nip the opponents in the bud.
In the last quarter, we had zero error, but the opponents have already been overtaken by events.
Awareness and heavy insistence, which was our weapon in the subgroup market, now turned against us all.
Today, we did not have any strength against their aggression.
The symptom remained calm in Kalevi, Matthias Tassis, with his care.
In Turkmenistan in general, good words can be said about the whole team; to date, there was a common thread.
It is a pity that such an aggressive opponent had not been met before.
The taxi has always been self-confident and still played out today, but it seemed that he was tired - he has borne quite a heavy burden.
But he made some absolutely beautiful moves I have seen in the past in the strikes," added the guide.
horrific figures: in the Nephrops, three-quarters fewer than 10 points were thrown at the EM-turniir ...
In the new age bracket, not only will the EE B division of young men operate in Tallinn, but the young men started the day before yesterday in Dublin.
And Estonia's game with Poland unfortunately caught up in the field of antiques.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after a third quarter it was still 9:49, i.e. it was only in the last 10 minutes that the opponents took their foot from the gas pedal, with a period of five to 16:16.
In the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4, in the third quarter...
In this case, two pieces of the first four strikes at the beginning in two minutes, but 25 pieces of the game, then one in three and then another in 21 throws ...
Perhaps in almost half an hour, 47 bits were caught.
In addition, 2 out of four were released.
The number of wage losses at that time was a reasonable one, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had a discard of 33% and Estonia 13% (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, with 83:56 improvements having to be recognised on the opening day.
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to replenish stocks
Today, NATO's 1 standing anti-mines team arrived in Tallinn for the weekend for a planned port visit, to supplement the stock of vessels and to prepare for future exercises.
During the visit, the ships will prepare for returning to the sea, providing crew members with the opportunity to take a holiday for a few days.
Following this visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters in order to carry out a number of exercises and be prepared for future historical warehouse search operations.
'The involvement of Estonians in the NATO unit and the joint training they undertake in their local waters are a good illustration of our integration with allied forces', said Captain Arto Reinmaa, commander of the Operation and Planning Commonwealth in charge of the Navy Navy.
Since 29 June, the Latvian Naval Captain Gvido Laudups, who took over the duties of the Group Commander at a ceremony in Riga from the Estonian naval officers in Captain Johan-Elias Seljama, will be led by NATO's 1 Permanent Mine Protection Team.
The flagships of the Group are the Latvian naval support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, which also operates as the group's chief executive.
During this semester, the Estonian Naval Minor, Sakala, will also be part of the international cell.
One of the four flotilla groups under NATO's naval command is NATO's 1 rd standing mine action team, a first-rate rapid reaction unit, which the Alliance can send to various parts of the world for five days.
4. - Until 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, which was established 13 years ago by the Maestro Eri Klas, will be held down.
This year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to Risto Joost (36), the artist leader of Filharmonia in Tallinn.
Risto Joost: The audiences will see the "Traviata" and "Tosca" classes of the ooworld, the balletic responses to the fascinating "Bolerost" folly "Karlsson" and also the lack of a planned production of its own, this time the "Years of the wonderful Orange" of Joseph Haydni by the same international creative team that performed Pirate in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre launches.
It is larger than any other musical theatre in its traditional form.
It is a festival whose snowfall takes hold and never waives out again.
Because the experience that a listener gets in this top-down and secret environment makes the human mind sound and touches human perceptions in a way that is impossible to describe.
Risto, you are the first-year Artistic Director of Birgitta Festival.
Did the shoes of the Maestro Eri Klas look a little large?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klass, it has been very helpful.
He led me through my whole career as a student and also supported me at the beginning of a dirigisme career.
It is perhaps thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue her work.
The team of Birgitta Festival has been so well-earned by various Klas and, of course, all of this will be passed on to me as well.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things are going.
It was the great heart of Eritrean Klaus that gave me the strength to go forward with the great strength of Filharmonias Birgitta Festival in Tallinn.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What could the audience say at this year's festival about what you are proposing in particular?
We have the artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, surprisingly, the first ballet, by the way, written by Astrid Lindgren.
It is 'Karlsson flies'.
And one of the nuances of this ballet is that it is the Latvian composer, Juris Karlsons, who expressed a desire to write it.
He has probably lived in the breath of Karlsson's bear since his childhood.
Risto, how can you put all this together?
It is certainly thanks to my supportive partner.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I am happy to have that.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend so much on other people as I, for my part, might be the way I approach every new day.
And such a conscious tone, maintaining a position and actually smiling at myself in the dawn of the morning, significantly increased my happiness.
Particularly this week, when there are the most important tests, I have been particularly keen to practise it and it works.
Self-smiling is stirring up the brain and raising the tone.
This is not just empty words.
I think people still do not know about half the things in their body that the universe offers them, but each one will gradually discover them.
Now is an important moment.
Is there a ritual before dirigend pulti?
It is true, however, that clothes need to be replaced with clothes that are more comfortable.
It is a small moment for itself.
But, generally speaking, yes, I do not have the opportunity to rest or make a little sleep before I have a big appearance.
In fact, I even like to be in active contact with people, even before I get into the dirigation.
But all come to Birgitta Festival, there is something to discover, not least to a great friend of opium and ballet!
Watch the entertaining video with Risto Joost!
New findings of the Swedish age assessment tests for asylum seekers were published
The most recent results of the test show that more than 80% of those tested were rated older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute for Judicial Matters (Rättsmedice) started the tests earlier this year.
Tests were set up to assess the age more accurately when applying for asylum after criticism was levelled at the Swedish Migrationsverket (Migrationsverket) for failing to properly determine the age of a number of allegedly minor refugees.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to testing and the Institute of Institution has issued a total of 2481 tests between mid-March 2017 and 31 July.
Eighty per cent (2002) were assessed as 18 years old or over, and another 25 judged the Institute of Justice that the test could be "18 years old or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person is 'probably younger than 18'.
Tests will only be used if a person's age is in question.
According to Johan Göransson, who works for the Institute of Institution, the results are consistent with those of previous months.
'We do not see a big difference from the statistics of the past months; the numbers are quite consistent,' he said to The Local.
The fact that a large number of cases were assessed as over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued 581 tests in May and said that in 442 cases 'there are indications that the person being investigated is 18 years old or over'.
However, when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet looked at the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases, the person had directly stated that he would receive 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, whereby X-rays from software teeth and MRT natives are made available for analysis by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some quarters.
One of the sceptics is the endocrinology of the Karolinska Institute, Claude Marcus, whose tasks include assessing people's biological maturity in order to find out whether they passed a bottle sooner or later.
"I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measurement method we are currently using should be used.
Setting the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say with certainty, we should not face up to the fact that we are going to get," he said to Metro.
But the accuracy of the tests was defended by Johan Göransson's Institution of Judiciary: 'Generally speaking, the risk of imprecise adulthood of a child is small.
The highest risk, at around 10%, is in the case of a person under 18.'

Anna Maria Orel, a 20-year-old vassal performer, made a nice debate in the World Cup in London, with 67.370 as the 18th place.
Orel was the youngest female gentleman of the MM, and a joyful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The contest went well and I had a good experience.
With the first test (64.80), I immediately achieved my average result, with the second (62.80) at risk too much, and the third (67.37) I was able to make it quite clear," said Orel after the contest.
I was looking for my emissions and I am very pleased that I found them.
The debate on the Anna Maria Oreli MM closed with a busy 18th place.
Vihmasadu Orelit did not mix, because after all he drives winter through the TTÜS stadium.
'I am afraid,' he said with a little 'mummy'.
At the London Olympic stadium, there was almost a full-house chamber of people, did Orel sense the people around him or could it shut itself off?
I understood, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it will add - that is!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he was satisfied with the MM debate and that there were still many good competitions ahead of him: 'I came here with the 32nd result of this year, I concluded in 18th place.
This is a very decent result.
I am 20 years old and at the MM - that is the only thing that matters.
I have a good experience, and in a few days I want to compete on behalf of medals.
Western Virgina Governor announced party change
The Western Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening at a meeting with President Trump that he would change political parties.
'Like it or not, the democrats walked away from me,' said Governor Justice.
'Today I say to you, having pleaded for and thought ... today I say to you, to the people of Western Europe, I can no longer help you as a democratic governor.'
The celebrations sparked off joy at the gathering.
"So tomorrow I will be a Republican,"
'As a trustee, I would say to you that it is time to play second fiddle.'
Trump had previously promised a great deal of publicity at the gathering of Western Virginia.
Trump won with 42 points in Western Virginia and Justice did not support Hillary Clinton, the democrat candidate.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the state's only billionaire, was elected in 2016.
Forbes states that it owns coal mines in five states and that it owns a coal business entirely on its own.
It is worth around USD 1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) published a announcement on Thursday evening that 'the change of political party of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party which would prevent the country from being made better again, rather than working for it'.
'From a mere 15 Governors and controls over the smallest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent rejection of a party that is out of control and unable to find a positive and unifying message,' said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in CBS News statement.
It is hardly surprising that, where there are many people, there are many injured people.
Urmet, who is in a medical tent on Weekend, told the tablet yesterday that they had to distribute quite a lot of posters.
Cereals and martyrs are fundamental, excessively twisted and light crashes.
Of course, the legs, spine and footwear as well.
According to the Agency, visitors come to the festival with false footwear, and so the problems come.
The media have also had to help visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some panic stories and also one foot-and-mouth.
We have also studied when a person has broken his hands or his finger.
We are making fewer exercises here; we are sending more hospitals.
Watch a video to see if the festive medics are asking for painkillers to treat the silicon.
Coe praised Russian people's sincere apologies for doping scandals
Sebastian Coe, the international armies' body, praised, as he said, 'Russia's honest excuse of Thursday' for its doping scandal, but repeated that now is not the time to allow the country back to sport.
On the eve of the IAAF World Cup, Dmitry Shylakhtin, a Russian lighthouse company, said that the ban on competition imposed on his country was the right thing to do and that he had a strong commitment to fighting doping.
He apologised for 'all the lightweights, from whom gold and silver medals have been snatched away during the competitions'.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of keeping the ban on competition imposed in November 2015 after the WADA report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
'I think it was a very honest answer today, a very honest presentation,' said the President of IAAF, Mr Coe, to the journalists.
'The whole Council and the whole congress were pleased that the Russian Permanent Representation itself admitted that they had been through rather difficult times and that they were doing everything possible to restructure the permanent state.'
She was also pleased, as Coe said, that Russia accepted the criteria for its restoration.
'I believe that today was a very constructive day and that progress is being made, but Congress supports the Group's proposal that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia,' said Coe.
'We must do everything we can over the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always acted on the principle that we want to separate clean sportspeople from the spoiled system,"
Nineteen Russian lightweights who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF will compete as neutral athletes in the World Cup on Friday in London.
Rune Andersen, Chairman of the IAAF Group, said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet a number of criteria for rehabilitation.
After his report to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that the control of doping was still inadequate and that banned trainers were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution will fundamentally change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
Not only does the electric car revolution dramatically change everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, but it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mining giants such as Glencore can say that they win in one place and lose out on the other, smaller mining companies do not help.
Glencore currently earns from coal and oil, but in the age of electric cars, cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nicotine demand will increase.
This year, the contributions to the spread of electric cars have been boosted by decisions by the governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway, which are promising a ban on the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
Because Volvo has already known that it is planning to give up the combustion engine and Tesla will bring a cheaper Model 3 electric car onto the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts that more electric cars will be sold in the next two decades than oil-powered cars.
'This will change everything for some metals', said Simona Gambranin Bloomberg, the raw material analyst of Capital Economics.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, the demand for which has been growing for years.
In electric cars there are about three times as many copies as in a conventional car, Glencore said.
More copies are needed in recharging stations, which is why, according to Mr Paribas, this will increase demand by around 5% by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for compound furniture, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore is benefiting from a growing trend in electric cars from soaring prices and from being the world's largest cobalt producer, according to the Jefferies Group.
According to this browser, Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals will win the race for electric cars.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, the London Metal Exchange has risen by 70%.
The price rise was 37%.
The left has also risen by 14% this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's share in London rose by 20%, exceeding that of the rival Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo Americani.
On the losing side there are lead companies, such as Recyclex and Campine, which have to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of the plug is the power-supply batteries for cars powered by petrol and diesel engines.
Electric cars use compound electricity infections.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand except when another purpose is found to overcome the fall in demand," said Michael Widmer, the analysis director of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch metal market.
The knock-on effect in the form of price movements has not yet been noticed.
Plii has this year risen by 17%, which is the best metal from the increase in the price of the main industrial metals in London.
Investors will only see problems for metals in the distant future.
'I am not sure that it is so bad for lead, because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive', said Herwig Schmidt, the head of Triland Metals, a metallic company.
If demand for lead falls, it is slow.
This may be the case in around ten years' time.
In the meantime, stricter exhaust gas standards mean that there will be an increase in demand for hybrid cars, which depend on developed lead-based batteries for frequent engine deployment, will be assessed by the international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel, as a lighter car can drive with less electricity.
This explains the additional minimum requirement of 1.6 million tonnes between 2013 and 2016.
This represents 2.7% of the world's total aluminium production.
This trend is likely to grow, says Widmer.
Aluminium has this year risen by 13%, as increasing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Suppliers do not sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce miraculous car light bulbs.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter melting steel to face the minimum.
'An extremely strong steel should be the answer to this development', said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There has been some progress in Europe.
The end of oil exploiting can also lead to suffering on the plate.
Approximately half of this precious metal was used as catalysts for diesel cars, Johnson Matthey, the metal refiner, said.
"Many of the current high demand for raw materials such as oil and plastics may not have high demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, the Natix raw material analyst.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance changes over 15 years.
Plastic manufacturers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
The head of Uncore, Marc Grynberg, said that in 2025 more hybrid cars would continue to be sold.
The great hope of designer manufacturers in the 10-year term is that the hydrogen powered cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos depend on the plastic to generate hydrogen-powered electricity.
So far, however, this technology has not proved commercially justifiable.
'There seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars in the Dialogue', said Exane BNP from Paris to Brunet.
German car manufacturers suffered a major setback in July because the Stuttgart Court banned the use of diesel in the Mercedes-Benz and Porsche cities.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs will not prevent Neymar's world-class transition from being a Spanish football club to the Paris-Saint Germain club in Barcelona.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that dominates the European game and has the power to deny crews the participation of the Presidential Meistrite Union in the tournament, are still waiting for Paris Saint-Geri.
UEFA's Financial Rules for Fair Play (FFFP) of 2011 mean that the PSG will have to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was financed without massive losses.
EUR 222 million (USD 262 million) were paid out to Barcelona for the sole purpose of getting Brazil out of its contract, and Neymar's salary will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of the Neymar transfer to the French club.
The PSG will undoubtedly be able to extract such funding to recruit Neymar and add it to its star rank, given that the team is funded by the family in charge of the Katar energy crossing.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot on recruiting players, but they have to balance this with legal sources of income that allow them to come out with football players.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini following his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs falling into big debt in search of success would actually be fraudulent and at risk of ruin if banks or owners were to give up support.
From 2011, the FFP will focus on monitoring these losses rather than on the debts of clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with the potential and then to spend a lot of money to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs may suffer losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini's shameless defeat from his presidency in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Aleksander Cefer, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules,"
Although PSG paid for the Neymar overdraft clause in the form of a lump sum payment, it is possible for them to divide this amount for the purposes of accounting throughout the period of validity of the agreement.
Neymar entered into a five-year agreement, which makes it possible to demonstrate a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million per year over the next five years.
In the case of the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, together with Manchester City from Abu Dhabi, received the harshest sentences.
The PSG was fined EUR 60 million (currently USD 82 million), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the Club was required to restrict the team of the Meistrite League in the 2014-2015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA searches for clubs that can try to defraud the financial regulatory institutions by challenging their income through club-owned companies.
The Katari company may be sponsored by PSG, but if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be counted as an official income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that Qatar Tourism Authority PSG was worth the money.
It has been said that part of the Neymar PSG service could come from Qatar via payments from the World Cup Management Committee in 2022.
However, the PSG and Katar 2022 deny that Neymaris could become ambassador for the World Cup and claim that UEFA's regulatory authorities could easily expose such a manoeuvre.
The penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in any attempt to disregard the rules.
People will be familiar with the situation on Thursday when they say that UEFA has not discussed the transition of Neymar with the PSG proactively.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PSG.
Recent reports show that the PSG generated profits of more than EUR 10 million in the 2015-2016 season, with a turnover of around EUR 542.4 million.
The figures for the last financial year have not yet been published.
The PSG hopes that the arrival of Neymar will have a positive impact on sponsorship, commercialisation and spacing.
The club is expecting an increase of at least 30% in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
Spain too, clearly irritated by the departure of one of the largest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar's transition by claiming that the PSG was infringing the FFP.
'This is a clear case of 'financial doping' for the club and the country,' said La Liga, President Javier Teba of Spain, to AS, referring to the fact that the PSG is primarily owned by Katari.
Arsenal's player, Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's attitude that the state finances the club.
'This is a consequence of property rights and has changed the entire football team completely over the last 15 years,' said Wenger on Thursday.
'When a club belongs to a state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, because a country can have other ways or other interests to represent such a big player."
Norway's low-cost airline Norwegian has a nice tradition of putting on a plane-belt the images of those who have moved across borders in their own field and have inspired others, says the trip.
Along with the expansion of Norwegian operating geography, the circle of people who have earned a seat on the aeroplane has also expanded.
Among the selected personalities are Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (picture) and Miguel de Cervantes.
In the short term, however, an aeroplane will be embellished by Freddie Mercury's legendary singer Queen.
Today, 50 years ago: a hurricane-meter storm in Estonia that teared down roofs and windows from houses.
A hurricane named after a storm on 6 and 7 August caused severe damage, particularly to the West, Khartoum and Raplamaa.
In Northwest Estonia, the wind speed during these days was over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one potato to another and tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was blind and rude, like the end of the world.
The houses were already flown with roofs, recalling an interview given in the Estonian nature of the magazine 'Linda Kurova Haapska' in 2002.
The town's husband saw his planted gardens collapse.
But what do the trees support with their hands, where do you get the trees against this storm?
The sea came under the window, spraying the windows inside the water', said Mrs Linda, who lived on the streets of Kalda in The Hapsala.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and that the perrose of the railway station had flown 20-30 metres away, the city saw most of the characters in the same way only next morning.
According to local people, the trees behind Paralepa were in the ground, some were completely long, some were half.
Everyone saw the very depressing, the storm ran like a war, from beautiful, old trees to rubbish.
Western Estonia was not particularly badly affected by the August 1967 storm compared to Western Estonia, but was also affected by serious losses, wrote in the Official Journal of Virumaa in 2007.
The Lossipark of Haapsalu and the Padise Park were wiped off the ground, but our wearing parks also suffered greatly.
In Tallinn, the wind was measured at a speed of up to 35 metres per second, or approximately 130 kilometres per hour.
In Tallinn, on the evening of 6 August, there was one tiny drop of pink that had been abandoned: 'Mother, Mother!
The chickens are in the air and can no longer be down!" wrote the Virumaa Teacher.
The building of the St Petersburg garment in the Village Land was destroyed during the storm so that it was later decided to be demolished.
The jury did not accept the foot-and-mouth structures which were not restored later.
The newspaper Punane Start wrote on 12 August 1967 that the clearance of towns and settlements from deflated trees and their branches is progressing slowly, and that the inhabitants could participate in the clean-up operation.
Fruit farms were also severely affected, and the newspaper stated that 'party organisations must be the instigators and the guide for both maintenance work and harvesting'.
Organs can be spoken if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of a clean wind in Estonia dates from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul measured wind speed at 48 m/s.
The Silk Road on the island was broken by measurement, so the radiation of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
Clarity of pure beaches: night cleaning and poor beach
Cold summer seasons also mean a smaller workload on the Tallinn bathing areas.
'If there is no air, people are on the beach, and if not there are no people', says the beach cleaner.
On the Stroom coast in the north of Tallinn, villains are ravaged.
They are offered by a low-key tractor which drives a drink on a plate.
In fact, the last seven centimetres through the sand, picking out the loggerheads and the stranglehold left on people: bottles, cigarette packages and so on.
People still come on the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If there is a beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if there are no people, there are no people, says Aleksandr Usov, the head of the coastal cleaning work at The Habert administrative association.
It is 6.30 p.m. and there is a lot of cleaning going on at the beach, because at 8 p.m. the playground has to be in order for people.
Uzbekistan is already buying at four o'clock.
Apart from Stroom, he is still keeping an eye on the coasts of Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumkhstan and Paljasaare Pikakari.
The amount of rubbish has fallen.
Years ago, it was much more.
People can now appreciate what is being done for them," says Uzbekistan, which has cleared the beach for 15 years.
It used to be that when something new was put in place, it was already broken the next day.
Now, what is on the beach is already being kept.
Price for a clean beach
One of the biggest works on Estonia's shores is the cleaning up of the rubbish that has been flouted to the shore.
For example, 400 000 tonnes must be shipped off the coast of Pirita.
"This is an incredible amount," states Uzbekistan.
The second large category consists of municipal waste, in other words, everything that people leave behind.
The Stroom coastal area, which has a longing of half a metre, has eight large rubbish dumps, which need to be emptied three times a week.
This is how much waste is created.
However, colder summers have meant that the amount of rubbish is one fifth less than otherwise.
The third type is the neglect.
For the most part, these are children's lives.
As a harvest this time, ten mud cars have exploded from the inside of the Uov sand.
They wait for the framework that leads to the beach.
'Normally more of them come, but this is a normal harvest': Uzbekistan already knows that it will soon find them in the sand.
Children come onto the beach and take toys to drown them again.
Landfill is dismantled
Erika Scholler, the representative of the administrative services in Habert, admits that the screening of the tractor is disturbing local people.
The poison, which runs from night to early morning, is interfering with the undoing of people living in the neighbourhood.
On a daily basis, however, this work is impossible.
In one month, you have to walk twice over.
'If we do not do this, we will be fined by the part of the city,' says Scholler.
However, the aim, like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu, is also to get the Stroom beach under the international seal of excellence.
"There is much more work in Estonia than in Europe to maintain the beaches," says Scholler.
We have more adolescents and stones and it is more difficult to get to the sand.
However, there is less rubbish on our beaches than in the rest of Europe.
Listening to the talk of rubbish on the coast, Martin, living near the Stroom coast, is indulging in a tangle of journalists and cleaning workers, highlighting the current bottleneck on the beach.
There is a picture everywhere this morning.
The problem is with birds and bottleneckers who have pulled the wool over their heads," says Martin.
Although it is difficult to expect people to be able to change their behaviour to date, Martin hopes that the urban government will take action on landfill sites and put them, for example, in cages to prevent at least the birds from going on there.
Overall, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of the Stroom coast.
It can be seen that the city is taking care of this.
It has become more appealing with children's clothes, lights and newly asphalt roads.
It used to be the case that only one way was possible in the rush hour," Martin notes.
Breakfast inventions in Stroom: coins only coins
A 40-year-old Dimitri, shutting down the coastline with a metal detector, has had to make use of this morning's snowball period.
He does not believe that something valuable can be found today or in the future.
The sea basins are not generous enough to do this.
'I have been working on this for a year and have not found anything worthwhile so far,' says Dmitry.
In the Dmitry treasure, there are some euro coins, bottles and also dangerous pounds which are then thrown into the dustbin.
There are usually coins.
'There is normally no such thing as gold, knives and so on,' says the treasure.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%.
The Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates will remain at their current level, as weak growth and softening inflation have softened speculation against the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that growth will remain sluggish as the household's windfall income has put interest rates on hold.
The policy makers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep the 6:2 rate to 0.25%, and fewer members are calling for an increase this month because slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its growth forecasts for 2017 by 1.7% and 2018 by 1.6%, and warned that the pressure on household incomes would persist, as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank also signalled that the increase in rates was necessary to contain the inflation caused by Brexist over the next few years and that a higher than expected rise in borrowing costs might be needed in the financial markets.
Members also voted a year ago for the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package that fuelled the economy as a result of Brexit.
In February, the Bank will put an end to the fixed-term financing scheme that offers cheap finance to banks, even though it has said that it is now expecting a GBP 15 billion more in this scheme, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision taken on this subject, the Bank says: 'The MPC average forecasts will leave gross domestic product (GDP) powerless in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household incomes continues to have an impact on consumption'.
Regarding the regulation, it was reiterated that 'some tightening of monetary policy' is necessary to mitigate inflation, to a 'somewhat greater' extent than anticipated by the markets.
The capital is currently forecast to increase first in the third quarter of next year and a second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any leaps were gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are comparable to those for May of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast of a growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
After that news, the pound has fallen on the dollar and the euro.
Nael fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make any changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened growing hopes of a rise  GDP rose by 0.2% in the second quarter of the previous three months to 0.3%.
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will gather some momentum at the end of the year.
The Bank's most recent inflation report gave households suffering from rising inflation and abject wage increases little reason to rejoice, saying that the situation will get a little worse before the recovery takes place.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent income shocks in the next few years, but wages are expected to recover markedly towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also stimulated by the growing demand for British produce, which partly compensates for the lower costs to consumers.
The decision comes one year after the figures last August were 0.25%, following the shocking EU referendum which caused the sudden weakening of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to breathe full life into prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's last decision, there was growing demand for an increase in the rate, because inflation had increased the pressure on hard-pressed households; in July, three policy makers called for the rate to be increased to 0.5%.
Inflation fell last month by 2.6%, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank's addressees said it was on hold and it is set to rise again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess over the 2% target was entirely due to the weakness of the pound.
The Chairman of the Coreco mortgage brokers, Andrew Montlake, said: 'In the light of the recent drop in intermediate resources, the mortgage market seems to be becoming more and more competitive again as lenders indulge in work and hope to end the year positively.
The inventory seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end as refinancing, often at no service fee and at a low rate, has become increasingly popular."
The NHS is writing to 10,000 people about a controversial HIV treatment
Patients will have access to 'transformative' HIV preventive treatment since September, following a battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should finance the medicine.
The NHS of England announced that the public health service is now making available to an estimated 10,000 people through the initial three-year clinical trial pre-exposure prophylactics (PrEP) - a tablet that is pre-positioned and has shown a reduction of about 86% in the risk of infection for high-risk people.
The NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the appeal court supported last year's decision of the Supreme Court that the NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite its own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities.
The Executive Director of the NHS, Simon Stevens, welcomed this announcement on Thursday as 'a major new intervention', while the National Aids ifond (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people, and there will be more clinics in October before the programme is introduced everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-mortem prophylactics (PrEP) is a hot potato of anti-HIV drugs that is taken prior to the incident in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
The pre-positioning of PrEP means that there is a sufficient number of certain drugs in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day, or at the latest two hours before the break.
Suitable candidates for treatment include lesbian or bisexual men, transgender people and people with HIV-infected partners who cannot be treated.
Clinics will identify suitable people willing to take part in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-infectious partner cannot receive anti-retroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their wish to participate in the programme with their local sex health clinic.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and the NHS of England signed the contract to receive the medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The aim of the clinical trial is to assess the true potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on who the medicine is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in large pictures.
Stevens said: 'This new comprehensive intervention should complement and enhance the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV.
This is another milestone in the more than three decades of the struggle against one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity."
Deborah Gold, the Chief Executive Officer of NAT, said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if correctly targeted to those in need and at risk, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at high risk of HIV in England, through this clinical trial funded by the NHS, have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and not dependent on negotiations with a partner, thus improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
The CEO of the Terence Higgins Foundation, Ian Green, said: 'The priority now is to ensure that the clinical trial is switched off quickly and that no HIV risk group is left behind.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial has been carried out, we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who are at risk of HIV.
The deputy minister for public health, Sharon Hodgson, said: 'The start of the clinical trial by PrEP is very welcome and long overdue after months of delay and consolation of the government's feet.
Evidence shows how much change this drug can bring to the prevention of HIV and to ending the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us one step closer to fully understanding the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is rolled out as soon as possible to protect people with HIV exposure and bring us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
Electricity prices rose by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania they fell.
In July, the difference in the price of electricity on the stock exchange between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to €1.94, compared to €7.71 this June, Elering announced.
The main cause of the price difference is the breakdown of the Lithuanian-Swedish community.
In Estonia, the average stock exchange price for electricity in the last month was EUR 34.33 per megabyte per hour, and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price dropped by 5 percentage points to EUR 36.27 per megabyte per hour.
In Finland the price was EUR 34.17, while the price of the Nord Pool electricity exchange system was EUR 26.37 per megawatt hour.
Prices increased by 12 and 7 percent respectively.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Finland by 75% of last month's hour to Estonia and by 16% of the hours Estonia had in Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of the hour between the two countries did not carry out transactions for the following day.
Ninety-nine per cent of the time between Estonia and Latvia was between Estonia and Latvia, while 73 per cent of the hours were used for transmission capacity.
The Nasdaq OMX market, based on transactions over the last trading day of July, could generate an electricity stock exchange price of around 34 euros per MegaByte per hour in August and 37 euros per MegaByte in September.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affects the price of electricity generation, rose last month and transactions were between EUR 5.04 and EUR 5.47 per tonne.
Living at the top - semi-cycle and smart designs have made it a home for the small Earls Court apartment
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate proprietor, replaced his large Knightsbridge home against the Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is on the first line of the Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne has not packed up her bags and sold the flat further is a tribute to the new design.
'Before that, I lived on much larger ground with a former life partner in Knightsbridge,' says Joanne.
'I was looking for something equal to the price I offered.
I was shown this at the Earls Court apartment and had similar high loans.
I loved it and made an offer the same day."
Since its first visit, this 93 square kilometre has been through a complete innovation cycle.
At first it was a sleeping bag and a sophisticated place to walk through the kitchen in order to get to the bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a semi-corridor to take advantage of the high glasses.
'I wanted high lags, big windows, a lot of light.
These were my demands,"
He has employed Duck & Shed, an architectural and designer member of Erfan Azadi Notting Hill, to take advantage of the 3.8 m highs and create a home that is not just a developmental object but a place where Joanne can live.
The law was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-corridor where you could stand.
Erfan had to take a creative approach.
'Beekeeping structures are quite complex,' she explains.
'We had to reorganise the spaces so that they would be in each other's hands without having to bow down.
It was not just about building a platform, but we used the steel team to get the upper and lower places right."
This decree enabled Erfan to produce two full-time tobacco in the room, with many dramatic elements.
From the polar bear, the old-fashioned copy of the Retrouvius window opens up a glacial lifestyle.
The golden furniture, the silver details and the retrograde Serge Mouille light highlight the style of the space.
The use of plastics plays a role in increasing theatre, spaces and lucidity.
There are mirrors on both sides of the short corridor to make it seem longer.
In Copenhagen, the spectacle of the back door gives the appearance of another window of opportunity.
In the case of input, the fine cap provides a storage space for all Joanne feed clothes and glass claims.
To the living room is accompanied by the possibility of closing the kitchen if it is not used, creating an image of a more glamorous space.
Collaborative kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this kitchen, however, is the fact that it is a garden-like door-to-door-to-door door.
'A bit of a design effort into this,' explains Erfan's steelworking of the sprayed MDF.
'It has a counterweight, which is why it slips very easily if it is pushed'.
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage, Joanne now has 16 additional square meters, an additional sleeping bag and a better flat plan.
'After all, the floor is what you sell - or what gives value to property,' says Erfan.
'An incumbent will come to a standstill in an outdated form and make calculations based on the floor'.
Here they have managed to increase the area of flooring, while using high-quality materials that add luxury to space.
"The materials are the ones you touche and thus help to create an emotional bond with your home," says Erfan.
'You don't love the electric cable on the wall.
It is important, but it does not sound like words."
This shows that good design and increased surface can help make something amazing about a fairly common flat.
In fact, they may even cause a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
Dane Jensen, the Chief Operating Officer, is the main fundraising agent in the Chicago Cloud, in competition with her colleague for her official accreditation.
No amount of money is counted other than the amount earned, in addition to which all ethics are forgotten.
She and her three children only see the man in the early morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I find myself thinking that it is the business world version of the 'Master's house' - even the speeches by Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler are similar.
However, what film goes on, the less the cabotage element will be, and the moralising intent of film-makers will increasingly be displayed.
A life-changing experience is when a child dies of cancer.
Now there is a choice to be made between work and family life.
A poet dreaming of a nursing institution makes the father, on his return to the great buildings of Chicago, think of really important things such as faith, goodness, love..., without even touching the catastrophe of the twin towers.
After the third scene in which the boy opens his father's eyes, there is a feeling that the film-makers are determined to get the audience to grips with, because even the most calibre viewer is unable to keep the tears back when he sees the suffering of a lovely cancer boy.
When a boy falls into school and his situation looks almost hopeless, the father will finally understand the immorality of his work and do a favour to an old man seeking work.
Now I am going to make a personal mistake - if a film is happy with itself, then I will reward my vision after a film's coffee, if I am wrong, then the script can be praised for at least one surprise.
There is a suspicion right now that I am losing my coffee - when a husband calls to Dane from a hospital and a man rushes through the corridor to the back of his body.
However, the boy has healed miraculously, and although her father has just lost her job, it is proving to be positive, because now it is time to deal with the family.
I can feel comfortable too - I can already predict the end of the American drama quite well!
In fact, the film is well structured, all the elements are there.
You get the smart, you can laugh, the actors are good and the morals are beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
Perhaps this film will bring it well.
Trump's new Human Resources Board plans to restrict the President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly will be able to do this.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the White House's new Human Resources Board intends to limit the flow of information that President Trumpin is receiving, including news, in the hope that it will keep the upper limit in the water.
Here is a quote from the reporter Josh Dawseylt:
'When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met with high-ranking officials on his first day in office, he pointed out the key problem of President Donald Trumpi in the White House, which he intended to solve  getting bad information into the hands of the President.
Kelly told officials that information had to be passed on to him, whether on paper or in meetings, because the President would make better decisions if he was given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems completely logical, but others have tried it too, and they have failed to monitor Trump's media consumption.
President Trumpi's relationship to television goes back decades and even now that he is in the White House, his TV-set habits have not gone away.
'If the candidate, Mr Trump, was dishonest about the media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also honestly reflected in the influencing publications', said the former campaigner, Sam Nunberg, in February, Politico.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that 'According to six former campaigners, the key to controlling Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that its personal media consumption includes a steady amount of praise'.
Well done.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits have never been 'under control' is ridiculous.
Perhaps those campaigners know something that the rest of us do not know - that the Trump lyrics would have been even more heart-rending without their interventions.
We will probably never find out about the spaces that Trump did not post.
When his assistants managed to save him a few times from trouble, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from constantly causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that, in the White House of competing parties, people are trying to promote their own interests without exception by passing on to Turkey material that supports their worldview but may not always be credible.
The entire story, Politico, was written in May about the advisers' tendency to feed the President with information of dubious strategic value.
One of the examples given by reporter Shane Goldmacher is the following:
'Current and former Trump subjects say that Trump can react to negative press, especially with a damaging effect on leaks, on an explosive basis by observing their source.
This also happened at the end of February, when someone gave a badly-pressed copy to the President of an Internet provocateur, Charles C. A website belonging to Johnson, GotNews.com, accused the deputy chief of staff, Katie Walsh, of being the source of the 'White House' and 'a number of leaks'.
It does not matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter due to mockery, or that he did not provide any concrete evidence, or that he has made false accusations and withdrew them in the past.
Trump read the article and started to inquire about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Director-General of Staff, Reince Priebus, and the Chancellor of the White House, Rob Porter, had 'attempted to introduce a system for the management and documentation of documents reaching Trumpin'.
How did this work?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more efficient manager from Priebus, but Trump is still an impulsive one, and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanged factors make the Kelly mission very difficult.
Street musicians coming from abroad to the capital will not be able to obtain permission to stand up.
There are many foreigners in the centre of Tallinn.
Those with whom the Good News came admitted that they were playing in the old city without the permission of the city administration.
The first time we found three street musicians near the Estonian gates who had taken the same dog with them.
It was clear to see that the musicians with tanks and perfume were comfort travellers, for whom a duš mark would cost.
Despite the outburst, the only woman in her company played a funny game with a cirrhosis, while one man, next to her, called three balls in a zombie and closer to the translators.
The third man was sitting next to them on one side and smoking a wrecked needle in his heart.
Their three dogs did not let themselves be disturbed by the passing public.
Mr Bob, who played the Academy with Noemi and the Palace, said that he was mushrooming in the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the intervention was to collect the ticket money for a ship travelling to Finland on the same day of the night.
On the question of whether they would ask for permission to crucify in the Old City, the head of Noemi and Bob was shaken.
Firstly, we did not know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple, and most of the time permits are granted for a month or something like that.
There is no point paying for it," explains Bob.
When we returned to the Estonian gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women are on musicians and are driving them away.
The team went to the centre of Viru with his back bags and dogs to congratulate him on the crossroads.
There were also three Polish young men in the Estonian street, one with a sign, another with a glass, and a third with an electronic glass.
'We are here to offer people entertainment to spread music and joy and make money for fuel and living,' explained the trio of the piano Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that the permission of the city government has to be in order to be present.
'Of course we do not have it,' he said, laughing.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we go elsewhere, but we have to try," he added.
The Bank of Estonia purchased bonds worth EUR 149 million in July as part of its public asset programme of the central banks of the euro area, while the Bank's bond portfolio increased to EUR 4.36 billion.
The Central Bank does not provide more detailed information on purchases.
Hardo Hansson, the President of the Estonian bank, has previously explained, by answering a questionnaire from the members of the national assembly, that the plan for the asset of the central banks of the Eurosystem covers three different purchasing programmes: bocovered bonds from the financial sector, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public bonds (PSPP).
The ECB buys bonds in the market to encourage investors who sell bonds to invest elsewhere.
The impact of purchases reduces the return on assets with lower risk, and this motivates investors to take greater risks.
As a rule, each central bank buys its own government bonds as part of a public bond programme, while other countries' bonds are not purchased.
As the Estonian state has not issued the bonds, the Bank of Estonia is making so-called replacement purchases within the bonds allocated to it.
Central banks are also making purchases in those countries where the offer of bonds corresponding to the purchase scheme is restricted.
The Bank of Estonia purchases the bonds of the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank, as a general rule, with the confirmation of Hansson.
The Bank of Estonia will purchase bonds in the form of an asset purchase programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering's bonds were also purchased, but from June 2016 the Bank of Estonia will no longer buy Elering bonds.
On behalf of the euro area central banks, both Elering and Estonia will purchase the Finnish central bank's bonds as of June.
Migrants ignore the crash and return to the "millionaire zone"
Some of the wealthiest home owners of the West Midlands have once again been fiercely confronted with determined travellers who have ignored the crash of a council to win back an area far removed from their woods.
The migrants have parked off their 20 lashes to a prosperous 'territory of millions' on the streets of Solihull, who was crowded.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks after they were thrown out of the area only in May, without being confused with the crash covered by the Council to prevent them from entering the area.
The practical group found a weak place at the defensive borders, shifting its vehicles from the unstoppable part that had been left on foot.
The Marxist people are awake to the council of Solihull, saying that the council is 'useless in dealing with the problem'.
An anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday evening after they were evicted from Bentley Heath, where they laid stones at the end of their lives.
The council must be ashamed to take action because it is useless to deal with the problem.
The migrants were there in May, they were expelled and now they are back again.
They came up last night and probably more today."
He added, 'Birmingham County Council knows how to deal with such matters by getting long fences to protect its parks.
I live on the streetsbrook route and I am not happy to have to continue paying the County Tax if the council cannot even stop this kind of thing."
A local resident who also wished to remain anonymous said: 'This is ridiculous; it was only when we saw the last of these migrants leave, and a new offensive is already taking place.
This time the number has increased and the grasshops are even more memorable than the horse."
The representative of Solihull's council said: 'We are aware that the Streetsbrook road in the surrounding country is an unacceptable camp, and we are working with the Solihull police; we are taking the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
It is very helpful to gather evidence if as many local people as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by dialing number 101.
This will help to provide an insight into the situation for the Court when we present the case to them."
Indrek Saar, the Minister for Culture, will visit the Weekend Festival, among others, and will be pleased that it has been possible to bring real world top names to Estonia.
To the question of why it is so important for Estonians at the Weekend festival, the Soldier says that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the festival's three days in full.
But she says that real people in her field have come to Pärnus.
'When you look at the level of artists that you have been able to bring into Estonia, the absolute top names of this musical theatre are brought home - that often does not happen on our premises,' the Minister for Culture says.
Which artists on the festival, however, are speaking the most about Saart himself?
I consider myself to be a relatively old man, and for people like me, surely one of the most experienced artists, Armin van Buuren, who stood up last night.
His record is that all of us have, at some point, got on our own feet," he says.
However, he also brings out a number of other names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian artists too: from NOËP onwards, they can be read in a whole series.
In reality, this well-known concentration of names is very high," he says.

Audi renews up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the midst of criticism of car manufacturers
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW said it was providing software upgrades for more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the Chairman of BMW, the company believes that 'there are smarter options than driving restrictions', referring to European cities, including the home town of BMW in Munich, which has considered banning or limiting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he will renew the 3 million Mercedes in Europe to reduce exhaust emissions from diesel engines.
None of the companies described these actions as a call-back.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment installed to neutralise exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles will increase for automotive companies, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also being accused of harassing powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which kept quiet about the use of so-called fraudulent devices, which allowed the example of exhaust gases to be adapted to the regulations when a car was tested, but then withdrew in normal driving conditions.
A number of Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of a thermometer unit in the Audi motor development department was arrested in Germany.
The former President, Mr Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, the Audi in Germany was drawn into a criminal investigation concerning Volkswagen when the authorities accused the audit system of being installed to circumvent the requirements for European exhaust gases, thereby extending the investigation, which had previously been focused on the United States.
Involving the auditor in the investigation may be a major blow to Volkswagen  a luxury craftsman generating a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
Estonian schools will acquire EU flags for an amount of EUR 20 000.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags for the Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
A total of 105x158 centimetres will be awarded to 570 educational institutions with a European Union flag.
Licences are designed for export in indoor spaces, have to be performed in high-quality printing in indoor spaces with tunnel approval, intermediate the ERR newsletter.
There is a text on the Silk Road: 'King to the Estonian Schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union of Estonia.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education's price, which means that one ticket costs EUR 35.
Journalist murder highlights growing threat in Mexico
The weekend Riodoce workers usually gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Singapore, fuelled by organised crime, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
Today, however, they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They are told that it is important to change their routine.
Two older publishers are discussing which seems safer: either to bring children into an office which was the target of a graphic attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
The security experts have written three words to the front line: 'enemies', 'neutrals', 'allies'.
They ask reporters to provide names for each quarter of the total  evidence is not needed, impressions are enough and feelings are not.
The pay of the government or cartels is suspected of being drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists  a whole list of maligners who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
There is no turning away from violence, and the more dead bodies accumulate across the country, the greater the number of journalists  according to the Journalist Defence Committee, they have been under public protection since the taking office of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012, at least 25.589 journalists have been killed in at least seven countries since the attacks and threats took place.
The latest fatalities include their editor and source of inspiration, the co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
'The greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,' wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence can be felt everywhere  Riodoce House facilitator carries a big picture of a mediocre Valdez with the letter 'Fairness' and two reporters in the 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts with his smiling prillings or character.
Reporters are discussing a common trauma, their nightmares, their dreams, their paranoia.
Although a special public prosecutor's office for journalists' cases was set up in 2010, only two cases have been prosecuted under the auspices of the Committee for the Defence of Journalists.
As in the case of most annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, which amount to thousands, journalists' killers are rarely brought to justice.
Riodoce's edition continues to reflect the violence in Singapore, even though their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without murderers' data and justice, the meeting on security will not be of much use, as Ibarra put it.
'It's very nice to waste your time at this meeting,' she says.
'As long as the cause is unknown, you distrust everyone.'
Valdez left the Riodoce office in the capital of Culiacan on the morning of 15 May.
He managed to drive only a few quarters before the two men stopped the red Toyota Coro; he was forced to leave the car and was shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which translates as 'the twelfth river'.
A gun-picking man walked away in the Valdez car and made an accident in his vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left behind by a woman and two adult children.
The rumours are spreading freely in Culiacan.
However, on the subject of Valdez, there is basically only a silence.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Singapore has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival cliques are fighting to fill the power vacuum.
It makes no difference that in the streets of Singapore, a few people, or even several people, are shot every day, or that the dead bodies are swallowed up by abundantly embellished double-dirty drug-taking tablets, which are larger than the homes of many people living.
Let us forget for a moment that the peace period indicates that only one cartel is operating in a maritime state with precious ports and drug barons entering the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Mr Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work, the co-founder and president of Riodoce, Ismail Bojorquez (60), feels enormously that he was unable to defend his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to the killing.
The first of these was the publication in February of an interview with the clique of a cartel competing with Guzman's shops and at war with Damaso Kordez.
This book book could be hated by the poet  suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they reached the newspapers.
The second mistake was that Mr Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid in another newspaper reporting the same story.
Valdez was legend both in Mexico and abroad and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to exist permanently.
He worked as a veteran reporter at the Noroes in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create a Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said in Singapore that 'it was impossible to deal with the press without tackling the narcotics problem'.
The newspaper ran for time with its brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish strong studies without fear of censorship, and readers read a print in which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its Latin American coverage.
In the same year, Valdez Journalist Defence Committee (AKK) won the International Freedom of the Press Award for its courage to follow the narcotics of Mexico to wherever it leads.
He frankly admitted that he was afraid.
'I want to live on', he said when he received the AKK Prize.
Last October, he told a TV channel Rompeviento TV in an interview that drug trafficking is a way of life in Singapore.
'You have to take on the role of a journalist's office; another way of playing is to play with a fool.
I do not want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I did not talk about what was going on.'
The Riodoce Collective yearns for Valdez, a funny man who robbed like a madrus, a friend who kindly shared emblems and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always carried his candidacy.
He went from office to the El Guayabo bar and always sat on the same table.
Now they are asking whether his routine anxiety has befallen him.
His death has also led them to question how best to do their job and stay alive.
'They do not like rabbits with their women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing platforms used to transport drugs.'
'These things should not have been touched,' said Bojorquez.
The result is strong self-censorship and self-restraint even in the best of times.
Trust in your instincts.
If it breaks out dubiously, keep your distance.
According to Riodoce editor Andres VillarRea, the problem is that 'the explosive branch can be defrauded ... and this is what happened with Javier'.
He and others are saying that the old rules no longer apply in Singapore, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero or in other states that are home to the toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In Romania, where the Riodoce workers came together for security training, suddenly no more mobile phones were allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that only the clothes sold to governments had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
In front of the House, two policemen were looking for a 40-degree heat relief in the shadow of a tree.
The government ordered them to guard the Riodoce Office, which is located in a four-year building in the middle class of Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered, half-heartedly, whether these police officers belong to the 50% of police officers whose Governor himself has deemed unreliable.
Several months have passed since reports have been travelling to mountainous rural areas where control is de facto in the hands of drug addicts.
Riodoce's edition this week covered three main issues.
One of them was the murder of a brother of the former poksilegend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about the spending of government money on the Governor's home town.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter of the public office of the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement as to who was kidnapped or how this happened, so you had to be careful when it came to writing what everyone in the city knows about  the restaurant is a place of attraction both for drug dealers and for the authorities.
The report learnt from public documents that the restaurant was registered as a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for almost the whole of the last century.
In recent times, several IRP Governor has been accused of widespread corruption in the context of court cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, named El Chapo, escaped from the military trip.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have been looking for the Valdez column to get information on kidnappings from the best sources.
'Previously, we would have known what happened,' said Villarreal, a 46-year-old whose body development has earned him the name El Flaco.
'Now all channels of communication with our sources have been cut off'.
The Valdez office has become a depositary for labels and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they could never have expected  activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a couple of notes and went to the local public prosecutor's office next morning for a demonstration for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the death of Valdez.
The burned body has been burnt down and, according to the officials, it belongs to it on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists have become more vocal across the country and, in an organised protest, are crippling the phrase 'SOS press' for pavements and buildings.
On that day, President Bojorquez will be in Washington to try to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death, in meetings with the Governor of Sinaloa, the Ramirez authorities accused the journalists of spying on and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked to be diverted from reflecting the government's actions, worried that hatred had affected its objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were 'restricted' by organised crime, complicit state officials and a half-hearted society.
In his latest book 'The Narcotics' he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug addictions, but also by politicians and security forces who are involved in organised crime.
Last year, the Media Monitoring Group, Articulo 19, attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and state officials.
'You die in Mexico because you want to be silenced,' said Ramirez.
The effects of the murders are obviously verbal.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found together with a letter, probably signed by the cartel Los Zetas: 'I am here for my reports'.
Together with his unlicensed head, he lectured computer clips and side classes.
Some of the publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, following the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breachi in March.
Others are going ahead as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their president in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke to the drug barons in public with the headline 'What do you want us?'.
Some journalists have fled the country or even the country.
This is a nervous decision.
It is hard to find work in distances, and they still have to take to the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they are driven, as probably happened to the photographic graph Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in 2015 in a Mexico apartment three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
Those who remain stuck and continue to work have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that narcotics scare her.
'Mexico is on its way to hell and that is why I started my report,' he said.
A recent Friday midnight, when the latest number had already been snowed, saw the Riodoce editors sitting in front of the office walking and screaming the shoulder when suddenly all the phones started to vibreed.
In the coastal fever in Mazatlani, 19 people were reported to have died in settlements between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as was promised by the many abandoned messages from the cartels found in the region.
On the other side of the wrist, the reporters put news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
Next day's presentation needed to be changed.
The Sireens were blown by  another in the region to come.
The Bojorquez pipe topped the policemen on the alert to see if they are vigilant.
If they were afraid, they did not at least show it.
The founder of the newspaper, under the massive portrayal with its average scream of seeing the whole of Singapore, was handed over by the Riodoce workers in his tracks.
'How can one think of closing down at all,' said Bojorquez, 'when, on the same day as Javier was killed, a trainee asked me to report back to the streets?'
Dinosaurus used a protective colour to avoid enemies
At first sight, it looks like a shape, albeit rather frightening.
Scientists have now unveiled the first findings regarding the existence of an incredible rhinoceramic size discovered by a minefield that has been preserved so well that the experts have described it as 'the Mona Annex to the dinosaurs'.
It has even survived so well that it was even possible to find that the leather covered by his/her favourites was a colour of the red colour and his past had been somewhat 'complicated'.
The report published by Current Biology described life as 'the best preserved thermal market ever found' and as 'one of the best dinosaurs in the world'.
Fossil is a new type of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the critic era, 110-112 million years ago.
Its unbelievably good retention stunned the scientists who describe it as 'truly remarkable'.
This vegetarian mixed with salt is, according to the National Geographic magazine, the best preserved type of fossil that has ever been found.
This was discovered on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mine in the Suncor Millenium mine, Fort McMurray, near northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that did not resemble a surrounding stone and decided to take a closer look.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Palaeontology Museum.
For the next six years, work has been under way to get the animal out of the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kilos).
After all this hard work, the final result is now finally ready for public scrutiny.
'If you scream your eyes, you can almost believe that you sleep,' said Caleb Brown, the leading author, at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where life is being exported.
'This will go down in the scientific footing as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - Mona Annex to the dinosaurs.'
When she searched the skin, scientists found that this plant, although covered with salt and resembling a thriving tank, was likely to be severely threatened by the meat-producing dinosaurs.
This dinosaur, which was full of salt, used the red and white protective colour to hide from predators, and applied the salami-slicing technique known as 'objections', which is also used by many modern animals.
This allowed the dinosaurs to be better absorbed and the enemies to be avoided, according to the experts, because the major dinosaurs probably had a hunt for them.
This life of a 110 million-year-old Slovak family entered the news for the first time in May and is now visiting the Royal Tyrrell Palaeological Museum.
Scientists have now investigated the existence and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory at the Markmitchell Museum in Borealophil, who was part of a team that spent more than 7 000 hours revealing the animal's pain.
Thanks to the amazingly good retention of her staff, Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the wishes on the body.
They found an objection, a form of protection common to the animal state, which meant that the upper side of life was darker than the lower end.
Although the objections are widespread, the mouths come as a surprise, since Borealopius is much larger than the live animals of today.
It implies that the dinosaur market was sufficiently actively hunted by other dinosaurs, that evolution favoured secrecy instead of confrontation as a survival tactic.
But most of the modern-day hostile animals - e.g. horrors, mixers or armies - are much smaller and more vulnerable as harvests, indicating that the ocean itself had to make a real effort to survive.
"The forceful hunting of the dinosaur market, which is so vast and so sparsely covered, shows how dangerous it could have been to rob the dinosaurs of the time of the crisis," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds also revealed that the asparagus leather was a red light.
Scientists will continue to produce research to get insights into this life, including the preserved content of this genius, to find out what we are creating as our last resort.
They believe that the dinosaur crashed into the river, thus entering the sea with a stream where it drove out into the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in the South Floride, and rivers and oceans were probably far further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurant is truly remarkable as it is fully covered by the preserved thermal skin, while remaining three-dimensional, preserving the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
'As a result, nowadays creation looks almost the same as it did in times of crisis.
You do not have to use a great deal of imagination to reconstruct it: you simply have to pull your eyes and you seem to be sleeping."
This was a time when the Earth was buried by the enormous dinosaurs - whole cousins - of meat eaters travelling on two legs.
Although King Tyrannosaurus rex of all of them lived millions of years later than Borealopah, some of his frightening predecessors could hunt for this boosted dinosaur market.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 38 legs (11.5 metres), a long and six-tonne monster.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the Current Biology magazine believe that Borealophate was bravored after death in the sea and this pattern of mum smog.
This was discovered on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mine in the Millenium mine, Fort McMurray, near northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is best preserved in the thermal dinosaur market in the world, including leather and salt, and it is complete coding up to the tree booths.
These lifelines were, on average, 18 legs (five metres) long and weighed up to GBP 3 000 (1300 kg).
Two mouths of 20 customs duties were spilt off its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this wet-covered plant in the adventure of the present Western Canada, until the flooded river flooded with its offshore ratio.
However, the undersea brewing of the dinosaurs helped to preserve its virtues excellently.
The shattered remains of this particular feature are so well preserved that the turkey in the dinosaur market is still covered by mythical plastics.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic: 'This degree of preservation is as rare as a lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The fragmented skin still covers column salt posters.
A better front is lying next to him, and five of the toes are scattered upwards.
I am able to count the appetites on her plate."
How did one activist find an answer to the question 'Whose streets?'
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a complete shock.
Just the day after travelling to New York, it was sitting on a bed, on a Facebook phone, on a temporary bed on a bed, via St. Louis's Airbnb.
He ended up in the post of his former fellow schoolgirl.
There was a letter: 'A young man of 18 has just been murdered by the police and is still on the street'.
He was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on his stream, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The mailbox @TheePharoah's user was repeatedly distributed along his timeline.
A carrot from the region of St Louis delivered a real-time acronym to Michael Brown, for the death of an 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer at Ferguson Missouris.
He posted a picture of Brown's life in a body that was lying on the street for four hours.
'This is crazy,' said Ferrell.
However, death was nothing new for him and his community.
He had his phone taken away, but later this evening he saw the spark again announcing this time people gathered at Canfield Drive.
Pictures were given of people in the police station, of those who are shouting, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept a label saying, 'My unarmed son has just been murdered by the Ferguson police'.
He looked at the real-time stream where a policeman stood in the tomb in front of a group of protestors.
In the second video, another policeman, he said, swept up and shouted: 'I kill you all ... animals'.
Ferrell reminds me of how he perceived himself with the idea that 'this is unusual'.
'This is not the kind of murder we are used to, which we might call typical.'
I felt a sense of fear at the time.
I was angry and I wept.'
He booked a return flight and was travelling home the following day.
Having landed at 23 o'clock, he returned to his father to his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would travel to Ferguson in the next morning for two nights.
What has happened with Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years will be the central theme of the new Whose Streets (Whose Streets?), which will appear in cinemas on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and defeat, of strength and perseverance from the point of view of the people who live in this community and who took to the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell, with a daughter - who had a flower stick on his back and had a crown on it - travelled to Ferguson, they once again talked about a subject that they had repeatedly talked about before this morning - the black experiences and living conditions.
'Remember, when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?' he reminds himself to ask.
'We are now travelling to Ferguson because an 18-year-old boy was killed by the police, and that is not right'.
'I could not take him with me,' said Ferrell later.
'What is happening now is ... the culmination of the past.
It needs to know and see and grow in the middle.
She needs to learn about activism and organisation, but also about the different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we need to do to be free and free.
Even if I succeed in bringing him up in such a way that he does not experience personally crude racism, he is no different from some other black girl.
I feel that I would be doing him a disservice if I defended him from this world.'
The first stopover they made when Ferguson arrived was South Florissant, a police station in a stretch of the road, which had become a kind of camp in which activists were waiting for news about the police officer Darren Wilson, who will not be charged in the end.
There, Ferrel and his daughter joined forces with the local business owner who made the dinner.
They put food products together and helped to distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, new types of activism were slowly taking shape.
'My activism changed completely after 9 August,' he said, noting that when he was a student at Missouri-St. Louis University, he was president of the Minority Students' Union and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
'I had no organisational experience.
It's all just a ragbag."
A week later, Ferrell met one of the film's co-directors, Sabaah Folayan, during the evening's demonstration.
Folayan said that he and the film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was going on.
The issue that arose in Ferrell's case was: 'Are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited?'
Such scepticism was the result of countless cases in which people - often white-skinned people - come into the community and try to benefit from its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: 'We had heard that the voice of the people born and bred in Ferguson would not be heard, and we wanted to do so in a different way.'
Folayan had already shaken hands with a co-director, Damon Davis, an artist in the region known for his activism in relation to prisoners sentenced to death.
His involvement made the project attractive to Ferrell and six other local people who were watched for years by the 'Whose Streets' team after Brown's shooting.
'Nobody is speaking for us or for us in this documentary, but we are speaking for ourselves', said Davis.
'It was important to me how these people were portrayed, because that is how I am presented.'
Although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell, which was to show that the movement was not about a 'redemption instructor but a coming together of the community', as Mrs Folayan said, she became the most open actor in the film.
As a result, the 'Whose Streets' surprisingly document personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as love and marrying one's wife.
'I felt as though I were naked,' said Ferrell, smiling for the first time when he saw a city ready.
'But I understood that to do this work and to humanise the black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability.'
Moreover, the case of Ferrell emphasises and puts the role of the black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement back at the centre.
Two of the three initiators of the movement who thought of the #BlackLivesMatter after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in the social media in 2012 are homosexual.
'In leading roles, black gay women have kept the movement going overall,' said Ferrell, 'and this is precisely because we have to fight on many fronts all the time.
Black homosexual women must bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed to point out that 'black women are indeed keeping their movements alive, and many of them are black gay women'.
At the same time, he argues that 'this is not a matter of any kind of equal opportunities' - Ferrell was not chosen as the focus of the film because of his identity.
'He was a man who gave the right energy,' he said.
'But it is no coincidence that he was right on the front line, because there is much at stake as a black homosexual woman living in such contact points.
His energy can be seen through the screen.'
At the same time, the news cameras from Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police are still fragile.
The conditional sentence imposed on Ferrell for blocking the road during his demonstration will last another 2.5 years.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in the region he calls home simply as 'a pipe dream'.
Nevertheless, he still considers important the mantra he has been eating since he took to the streets of Ferguson no less than three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose other than our chains.'
7 p.m. how to get over the knife of Weekoma
Some of the wealthy male boys find themselves having a chicken-and-egg feast, which they need to help.
Or it is based on the saying 'avoid a melancholy, stay drunk'.
However, this is only an inevitable postponement and a proper cure for health.
What can you do to make sure that, after today and tomorrow, the Weekoma Train - or other festivities - feel better in the morning and get as painfully as possible out of the melting pot?
Seal of water.
Alcohol underneath, after much brakes in the morning ... or, if possible, even alcohol instead.
As the body loses a lot of liquid when drinking alcohol, it must somehow be recovered.
Along with water, minerals are also flouted from the body, and the mixture is good for hair mineral water.
Since the house is often irritated after being smiled, it is particularly good that it is bubbly-free or has only been loosened lightly.
Let us walk away.
Surely it would not be worth going to the grandmother to burn the trees with a dinner melt - that could be a fatal miscarriage of judgement.
But easy walking helps to remind the body of what it is like to be alive.
Sleeping and sleeping dishes on a shipment are a more time-consuming way of getting well.
Give the body a gradual and cautious return of energy.
If you are already in the voyage of overdrinking yesterday, it is certainly not worth trying to load a sweet of high fat.
To begin with, for example, a fresh volcano containing fruit sugar is slowly spreading to the body.
If the health of the South is already suffering, for example, powdered water could be tested.
And a little later on, a bit later.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretics releases the body from the water.
As has already been said, water and volumes are good friends.
Do not contribute to painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent a melon in the evening, the Sun tax will not only have to deal with alcohol but also with parasitic or ibuprofen, and will thus lose its power.
In this way, you have broken your liver even more, and henceforth the pearl is worse.
In addition, painkillers do not last too long in the body.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, you will do it with a blank cheque - it irritates the already ruined houses.
Or, if you do not have a partner, you will get along well with yourself.
It is something like walking, but it is not by walking that you get slavery.
However, too active a speed and an exorbitant poos were avoided: during the mole itself, the physical effort should be moderate.
Do fun.
Speak to your friends and fellow sufferers with a silver thread, make simple fun and smile amicably about yourself and others (suffering).
It may not be the case that the beam and the skin do not pull the wool over the eyes, but they certainly make it easier to tolerate the aftershocks.
Sometimes the tide goes on anyway!
Northwestern professor and staff of Oxford University are being sought after suspects in murder
According to the police, a professor at the University of Northwestern and an employee at the University of Oxford are being sought nationally, having become suspects after having found the bodies of a male population with deadly chestnut wounds in one of the luxury colleges of Chicago.
According to the judicial documents of Cook Cook province, on Monday orders for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were extradited for the murder of the first instance because of their alleged association with the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated pushing.
According to a warning issued to the community by the Chicago Police Office, the body was found on 27 July.
Police officers made a telephone call and, when they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment, found a victim who had several storms on his body.
According to the officers, the Cornell-Duranleau site was declared dead and the investigators treated the match as murder, while the police actively searched for two suspects.
Lathem has been a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwester since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of the University for Public Relations, said in a statement sent by an e-mail that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from work and has been banned from entering the town halls of the University of Northwestern.
'This is now a criminal case being investigated by the competent authorities and the University of Northwestern is working with the investigators,' said Cubbage.
Warren is a parent in the financial department of Oxford University.
A representative of the University and the Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: 'We have been in touch with the British police and ready to assist the US investigation authorities in any way we can'.
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and would like him to give up.
The head of the communications department of the Chicago Police College, Anthony Guglitis, urges the suspects to hand themselves over to the authorities.
'The police have a clue where they are going, but we are looking more and more intensively at the exact location,' said Mr Guglielmi.
According to Guglitis, local, regional and national authorities help to locate the suspects.
Mr Guglielmi said that the police had received a telephone call from the administrator of the Grand Plaza apartment, who had just received a cryptic hint that something had happened in the apartment No 1008.
According to police reports, this was a powerful sight.
It is not clear, according to Mr Guglitis, whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said that the security cameras were confirming the presence of Lathem and Warren in the building.
'We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,' added Guglitis.
The Grand Plaza management wrote to the people: 'The police are currently working to establish the chronology of events and the background of the victim, and are studying various motives, including the possibility of a family dispute'.
Personnel companies that help your company avoid becoming the next Ubers
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees at his e-commerce start-up company, but the questionnaire was unprofitable.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse still, misleading.
And even when he promised to ensure anonymity, some workers did not trust this process.
'This system was simply not consistent and objective,' said Errett, which is the manager of Madison Reed, an e-Commerce company operating in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called for help from outside.
New types of human resources are being developed by start-ups that help companies find out what their employees feel.
Developing and licensing software with the firm aim of measuring employee involvement will enable companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide workers with anonymity and a hot line for complaints and, in some cases, allow language providers to bypass the C-level executives and approach the board directly.
'There are now tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, but where is Fitbit for your company?' Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO Redwood City, asked Glintas, whose software analytical tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
Errett says that he has had a much better picture of what his staff think and feel during the three years he has been using Glinti.
In addition to a sudden survey and questionnaire aimed at specific teams, it provides a hotchpotch of the company, which gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, enabling them to identify the causes.
Companies have begun to realise that they have to stay up-to-date with their work culture in order not to become the next Uberia, which has been in revolt since the former employee published a blog which described a harrowing environment where those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation and compatibility could be worth more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments website for statistics on financial technology.
The founding company Convercent in Denver, Colorado, which helps businesses to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, has seen an increase in interest and activity this year against the background of the dubious reputation of Uberia.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered itself as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent allows companies to send customised impulse tests, gather confidential responses in real time and look at the problem areas of thermal propulsion.
It also provides an anonymous communication line enabling workers to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when the CEO is involved, complaints go directly to the Management Board.
'Public opinion has usurped the regulatory authorities,' said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Mr Quinlan said that if a company found that it was treating its workers badly or was behaving unethically, it could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, the departure of workers and court cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant owner with more than 25 000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercenti for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures and to provide an easy way of communicating with the company headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find a telephone number or a mailbox in the company headquarters, lodge an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a discouraging and uncomfortable process, according to the general adviser of Ruby Tuesday, James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way of monitoring staff complaints.
However, now that the company is using Convercent, there are potential problems, such as discrimination, harassment or dishonest wage practices, which did not previously reach managers who were operating in offices in other cities or states, to identify and deal with them more quickly.
'I have the opportunity to get closer to the holistic 360 degree experience of my staff,' said Vitrano, who chairs Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
'And we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with employees.'
Quinlan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, after the auditor, Arthur Andersen, collapsed due to ethical irregularities in connection with the Enron scandal.
However, it was only when 'social media matured' that companies realised that they could not prevent their black laundry from being publicly laundered on the web.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy,"
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service by charging companies periodically for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supporting both start-ups.
Convercent sponsored $10 million in February for companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising its capital to $47 million.
In November, Glinti invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing its total funding to $60 million.
Such investments come as no surprise, given the interlinkages between companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that today's workers expect more from their jobs than in the past.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, there are high salaries and interesting projects with solely on-board contributions.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they are devoting their time to a company that has a positive mission.
"If people are happy with the company, feel they are being listened to and that the work they are doing is more satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice-President Linkeds Man of the Personnel Section for the General Benefits and Labour Experience, which uses both Convercent and Glinti.
Investors make a profit if their portfolio companies do well; companies do well if employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase the commitment and involvement of workers, it is no wonder that they will be supported.
Data on employee involvement is important, according to work culture experts.
However, this data will be of no use if the company's supervisors do nothing about it.
In fact, when a company asks its employees for feedback, it can create expectations that there will be changes.
And if the changes are not rapid enough or not at all, they can cause frustration and reduce worker involvement.
'When you ask for 4000 proposals, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations,' said Kotter International, President of consultancy and business management, Russell Raath, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too heavily on data collection.
'Because if things don't go to the end, the workers will think, 'Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?'
According to Erretti, Madison Reed, which now conducts six studies among its staff, has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glinti.
And after receiving feedback from frustrated workers on the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, he was able to restructure several teams in the company and offer communication training to address the problems.
However, Ruby Tuesdays will gather new data on workers and it is hoped that in the long term this will lead to a longer term commitment by workers in an industry known for its large labour force.
'If you are not committed to transparency, you lose the people,' said Vitrano.
'And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses."
The Baltic is a shining star for the euro area: incomes are growing fast
Although the 2008 crisis and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic, the three Baltic States are fast approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, according to Mr Bloomberg's reference to the European Central Bank's report.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, total per capita economic output in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Success lies in low debt, rapidly improving institutions and business- and free-market policies.
'The Baltic States, along with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where real GDP per capita has converged significantly from the EU average', the Central Bank stated.
Although the goal is for the economy to equalise its per capita output to the richer Western Europe, in 2015, the aggregate output of the Baltic economies per capita represented only 2/3 of the average country in the European Union prior to the 2004 enlargement.
Low wages have led the Balkan countries to seek better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, the local people are not at all enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of people in Latvia and Lithuania estimate that their economies are doing very well, or rather well.
The Czech Republic and Poland thought this of their national economies a little less than half of those surveyed.
NCAA's decision to cancel the double daily treasures takes place to make Bruinsi days long
It is almost 23:00 if the UCLA football team stops talking at the edge of a new exercise in the team's university city.
Some of them have fled the spark by revealing their trainee's first day efforts to hang on.
For a large part of the team, these migrations offer a midday break.
The players taking part in the Sunday courses will, after a three-hour strike, go back to the joint exhibition to learn, before returning to the Wasserman football meeting next morning at 6.30 a.m.
'The next three days will be a real test for them,' said Jim Mora, Bruinsi teacher, shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The decision by the NCAA to cancel the two-day strikes to reduce the burden on players has, in fact, made their days longer - at least until the final exams get to one side on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA's three first training sessions were scheduled to start at 19.15 in order to fit into an already tight schedule for players.
The shift from two traineeships per day means more days with one trend: the start of the Bruinsi traineeship workshop was almost a week ahead of the previous season and for the first time in the Mora's six Westwood seasons, traineeships take place during the summer months.
They are planning 18 strikes until 20 August, before formally preparing for the opening event in Texas A&M in September.
Mora says he is in favour of a change to the NCAA rules, although it adds another item to the tight schedule of players.
'They have a huge burden on three or four days and this is a serious challenge,' said Mora.
'And they will break through this challenge; they will strive, they will be wonderful young people.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it will be a real celebration.'
Once the camp is closed, UCLA's training will be closed, which will not be an easy task, given the clear view of the parking playground close to these squares and the remote Luskini centre, a higher-class hotel that has already got through the gate-mail protection network with football matches.
From this weekend, the hotel will be hosted by Bruges players, but Mora recognised that there could be problems with free tobacco over the season.
'We are implementing security measures,' said Mora.
"This is a real concern and it is not exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and get training there.
If you have a recording training, it can make quite a good deal.
But we use the security crew there and on the 8th parking space.
Let us do our best by using what we have.
I will try not to be particularly concerned about this.
We have a plan in place.'
The Savisaare-Ivanova electoral alliance, which was born in the Central Party, Kristiina Ojuland, who was expelled from the Reforming Rally, and Maria Kaljuste, who was forced to leave the ECB, will be seen by our Tallinn and by the party-owners, by AM Tallinn, which hopes that the electoral coalition created by the recipients of party politics will at least have the same presence in today's of the local elections.
Tibuses will, however, be counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether they are all divided up by sufficiently disappointed voters.
Who will be left with Savisari?
If the supporters of Edgar Savisaar have become small, one might wonder about the events organised in his election union.
One member of the national assembly, some former and present middle-rankings and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And can the reason why some of Savisari's faithful sympathisers and friends are being deterred from standing in Tallinn be sought to ensure that the 'Savisaar List' of predominantly corrupt and suspected corruption crimes is becoming a reality?
A filmed video on a Russian-language pop, with the participation of a senior from the city of Lasnamä; and a computer game in all senses, in which the chief executive, Jüri Ratas, has to avoid sinking in the towel and squirrels while driving on the bike: is this the way in which the central party is attempting, for the first time, to win the votes of 16-17-year-17 year-plus voters?
We will wait to see what other parties think of the young electoral campaign.
If a viewer from Kanal 2 or TV3 faces black spaces instead of entertainment programmes from the beginning of August, two options remain: to accept that henceforth only the EIT, the ETV2, the ETV+, Tallinn TV and English-language France24 channels will be available for free, or to surrender ten or ten television operators each month.
There are probably also those who openly rejoice in the television experience at the outset, but at the end of the day - albeit reluctantly - they pay for television images and advertisements.
The uplifting music, the cowardly people and the rubbish left in the streets are the unpleasant side-effects of almost every major music festival.
If you do not want to get a share of the noise yourself, it is worth going to your home country instead of paint at home - and leaving the risk of sleep to festivals for a large amount of money.
Washington revises Green Card rules
Media publishers quote President Donald Trump, saying that a new US immigration plan is planned which will change the rules of the Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, stricter rules on temporary work, and restrictions on family orientation regarding visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers' money, as it will change the way the US hands out green cards to other citizens.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump, according to media reports in the United States.
The young people of the Siberian Sejm are moving the town, the pensioners back to the country.
Anatolia of Yevseyev continues the tradition of the famous serfs of gold on the outskirts of the ancient Earth River.
He works as a driver at a gold plate, 140 kilometres from his home, along the side of the River Earth's Added River.
It is hard work: two months without rest for 12 hours of work, and then only 10 days at home and again.
In the three years of its work, Anatoly has only seen the gold once.
'There is a great deal of order there: there is thorough checking in to ensure that the wine is not brought in, and going out that the gold is not taken in', Anatoly says.
Mare Piho spoke to Haida in the village of the local lady Jaan, who has told her a great deal about the memories of her family in Siberia.
The architectural culture that is still preserved in the Siberian settlements will also have an impact on the domestic set-ups, because it is just that shocking, says Piho Mare, who has studied the most remote areas.
His first trip to Siberia will be 30 years later this year.
During that time, he has been there fourteen times and has lived there for a year.
After all, how many pigs left for Siberia at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century to get land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I say 8 000.
I took it out of Siberian knot, according to the men who have been thinking about it.
It is difficult to say exactly because up to 30 people could come in one group at the time, but the passport was given only to the man.
The passport was given to only one person, but he was accompanied by children, sisters and female relatives.
Look at how big the territory was here!
It was several times larger than the historic Setomato.
It needed to be educated, it needed to be managed in some way.
It came here as peasants, but their lives changed because here they ended up in areas that were not only agricultural, but also river (forfeiture), gold mining, industry.
For example, in New Petser, many pigs later went to work in the mysterious city of Krasnojarsk-45 (where Soviet power built the uranium enrichment factory - J. P.), when it was formed.
Did the cafés constitute the majority of the population in this region at the time?
Yes, they lived comfortably.
In addition, the tradition of married and multi-parenthood was retained for a long time.
Seven to eight children were in a normal family.
How much did the culture of Siberian cupboards differ and differ from that of the native eggs?
They are different, even though what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought in a huge amount of popular strikes.
They made their own distinctions (popular strikes) but they always made a distinction between what had been brought in and what had been done here.
Climate change has had a strong impact on the traditional hardware of flats, because it is colder here.
Changes have been made.
For example, there was a salt of Setomato meat, but here it was simply frozen.

The Muslim mother country was spiritually strong; it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now it is going to give it back there, it is going to affect them.
These girls who have lived here in their families have listened to astonishing stories.
I am thinking of the people of the Estonian Azo delegation who came to Haida on the day of the King of Seto and lived in their homes for four days - J. P - at the beginning of July.
What is still there is shocking.
'It is extremely easy to come and also to go to the road, because the city has a wonderful location: at the railway crossing point and at the crossroads of the roads', says Reigo Tamm, an opera from Tapsa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, a lot of sports and a lot of culture, and the pizza will be everywhere.
Kill is a top-down city!
There is a small island along the Valger River passing through the city, where the killers tend to hold January.
'This beautiful place does not appear on the train ladder,' says Reigo.
Anyone who is not afraid of cold water can swim in this river, because the river is full of sources.
I have been to the swimming there, I can do it!
On the banks of the river, a pipe can be held and a romance can be made - you can observe the flow of the river and think about life and the past.
I have also been going there with my bridges.
Tamm, an ocean, has, apart from anything else, travelled to the river on three bridges to get to his arches: 'As this place is on the side of the city, no one will come if their stories are circulating'.
'A wonderful look at Tape opens on the hills, but there are also health roads where you can drink, drink the winter and now, for example, play the discgolf - golfirada has been done, ketjua can be borrowed from the sports centre,' says Reigo.
The old profiles go there, of course, with their kettles, but I have not reached that stage yet.
Mr Rasmus Kull will probably have to be called to kill because he has experienced a discgolf fan and he has chains.
Left he lends to me!
The trip and the mountainous were inseparable from the present opium age of childhood.
At least during ski runs.
There are a lot of tears, frustrations and you can find in my sports life in this mountain.
Not to mention the broken cupboards and skins.
"The entire city is now full of construction works, all this becomes unknown," says Reigo.
However, an old and tired slaughterhouse is a very attractive place to play for a summer holiday.
I am pleased that my idea was taken up by Märt Meos, the leader of R.A.A.A.M in 2012, and that, with her theatre, she had to take a summer course.
Although this year's theatre season with Alexey Karen has just passed, on 11 August, the railway station 'Realisation' will be at a time when the old Vaccination building will be moving around in the 1980s.
'Between 11 and 13 August, the City of Tapa is the day on which an open café has set fire to the Vaccination House and cultural events are taking place, including the People's Rally', says Reigo, who is advising you to visit a town just those days from 91.
In the long yellow house of 1 May, the wooden bar has a museum since 1994.
'The house is small, but there are so many exports and so much information,' says Reigo, which is full of the history of the City of Tapa, most of which focuses on the railways and military operations.
The journey will feel that, if all the recommended sites go through at Tapal, the hesitation will be wasted for a long time, but fortunately the small town will be full of cafés.
'We have such good places to eat, and when you sit in cafes you sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad', he says.
Educated and young soldiers who have come to kill spend a lot of time in pubs cafés, so it is a strange feeling, sitting there, that you are in Estonia and in your home town, but that this international community is together.
I believe it would be very interesting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Friends, yes, we are moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for unlawful detention
Telechannel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tenancy.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people who had been illegally axed, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by the police on the island of Sithonia.
They were released on the same day, but an investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the TV channel 'Broadcasters were later released'.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tenancy and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone who misses a place of rest that is not intended for this.
The inspections will continue throughout the whole season.
According to the Ministry, the court can impose a fine.
Misleading wolves are crushing sheep.
Himalayan farmers, after a pause of years, are once again having to give the junta 'learning materials' from their herds - the wolves, probably scholarly, have already broken a lot of sheep.
This year, the wolves in Hiiu county have broken the sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep have been injured and eight have been injured, according to Hiiu Leht.
The figure was only three, a year earlier than 124.
In addition, the Environment Agency reports that the womb in Hiiumaa was not born and the Hiiumaa hunting council reports that two hunting sites have been fixed on the island this year.
On Monday, in the village of Kabuna, wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Emmaste and injured half of the 18 surviving sheep.
On the early morning of Wednesday, the wolves broke a sheep in the village of Reheselja on the pasture land and seriously injured another one who had to be killed in distress.
Clear rules for the management of genetically modified crops
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the transfer of genetically modified organisms to the environment (GMOs) and on the modification of the plant protection law.
The change to the law will do away with the creation of a separate database for both GM crop locations and operators, which will be used from now on in the plant health register.
In addition, the obligation for GM crop operators to have a prior agreement with a designated person dealing with beekeeping in a given radius will be amended.
Although no GM crops are currently cultivated in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for coexistence between GM and non-GM crops.
At least until Estonia has decided to GM-free," Sigmar Suu, Head of the Ministry of Plant Health, said.
'At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures being developed must be targeted and proportionate, take into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors,' added Ms Suu.
The draft law repeals the provisions on the repository of GM crop locations and handling training in the GMO VS and lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and the commencement of economic activities.
With regard to beekeeping, the current obligation for GM crop growers to inform beekeepers about the start of growing GM crops will be replaced by a commitment to reach an appropriate agreement with beekeepers before starting cultivation.
The draft law has been sent for coordination to the ministries.
All interested parties will have the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the draft information system and, if they so wish, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The changes planned will affect in particular those working in the field of crop production, beekeepers and the Agriculture Agency.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize MON 810 - is allowed to be grown.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has taken an interest in growing GM crops.
The reason for this is that there is no maize manager in Estonia, a European corn borer, which is resistant to MON 810 maize.
This maize is also being seized on to the southern regions, and this is not appropriate for our climate conditions in May.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Affairs commissioned studies to detect potential GM contamination in seeds of various species of summer turbine, maize and soya grown in Estonia.
Analysis of the tests carried out showed that seeds did not contain any foreign genes and the study concluded that seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
It can be deduced from the past that no GM crops are deliberately grown in Estonia, and it has also been confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Maticu as "genius"
Mr Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited 'geniuses' in the form of Nemanja Maticu after the average player against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening held his debate.
The 40 million pound-up player bought from Chelsea in Dublin in the last game of United before the Uefa Super Cupi Real against Madrid on Tuesday won a 2-1 win in the baseline, impressing a defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on aggressors.
But, aside from Blues' pre-season Asian tuna, Maticul was left in desperately needed matching form and he only held for 45 minutes, which Mourinho said had to be corrected well before the start of the Premier League season.
'He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant way of thinking - he has a spirit of football,' said Mourinho.
'Let us help him reach the format as soon as possible'.
Like Matic, other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Ronoise Lukaku started out in the opening stadium and Mourinho quietly installed his own starting man for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed that the club has already done an 'excellent job' by concluding contracts with three of its four priority options.
"I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four,"
'I am even happier if they can make four out of four, but they have worked hard for me.'
Another favourite toy was received on 1 August by the GSM sender and this time in Muhus.
According to the warring bird observer Mati Martinson, the first competitor in the air conditioned by an embassy, and the dishwasher is already flying around, has left the nesting yard and joined the large room of accommodation in Mullutu-Suurlah.
This is because there are no fields in the war, according to the Voice of the Solomon Islands.
On that Tuesday, relatively late in the day for rolling the cucumbers, the accompanying person received another competition, and that was on the island of Muhu.
According to Mr Martinson, the installation of the senders is, in fact, an international project carried out by Mr Leito and Mr Ojaste.
A competitor called Mati GSM magazine in the Friends of Turku was fitted to the soil.
'His actions are on the internet all watch: how he went to Spain to winter, returning for a long time to the German-Polish border and then came to Saaremaa,' Martinson said.
A British inventor could install a microchip in his own body to get a handle on his house and his car.
A British inventor became the first person in a country to have a microchip installed so that he could just open his front door, get into the office and even start a car.
Steven Northam, aged 33, had the right to install a tiny chip between his finger and his finger crossing, and is now also offering this service, through his company BioTeq, to businesses and private individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, consultant-anesthesiologist for the Royal Hospital of the Province of Hampshire in Winchester Hants, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip fitted to cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company is also exchanging locks for houses and cars to be combined with a chip, asking for GBP 300 per lock.
This father of a child in marriage has now installed the technology both at home and in his car, BMW Z4, which starts when his or her hand is on the wheel.
Value Maja's exports cost taxpayers thousands
According to the military documents published by the journalist TIME, the decision by the White House to fly a naval helicopter last month for an event to celebrate American production cost the taxpayers of the southern apple as much as USD 24 000.
The green and white colour Sikorsky VH-3D, termed Marine One during the President's visit, was the central attraction of the event presenting the American construction programme in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and Senior Officials of the Valge Maja all toured industrial products from all 50 states.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exported along with a champagne from Maine, a fire-fighting car from Wiscons and a shuttle tower made in Mississips.
According to documents of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the military cabinet of the White House demanded a helicopter presence, or FARGO, of a mile of 36 hours before the helicopter landed for the 'extraordinary' event in the south-east.
'I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an event which is unusually prominent,' said HMX-1 Commander the day before the event in e-mail to his superior, deputy chief naval officer in the field of aviation.
The message was that the helicopter would arrive at lunch on the morning of 17 July, around 7 o'clock in the morning for an event starting at 15:00 and would remain there until the evening between 18:00 and 21:00 on the same evening.
Included was the fact that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second coup would be needed due to working time restrictions.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, and the escort security team remained near the aircraft throughout the time of its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to find out from the documents given in the journal TIME whether or not a second rabbit was needed in the end.
The Hatch law prohibits federalist workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event might breach this provision.
'We asked whether this was in breach of the Hatch law and we were told that it would not breach,' the commander wrote.
'You do not seem to have a choice,' replied the deputy chief victim.
The White House declared the 'made in America' official event and Hatch law would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The President supported the efforts of health reform discussed at the time in the Senate and praised efforts to contain government regulations.
The use of an aircraft known as the Marine One or Air Force One for political gain is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for photography is unusual.
Trump caught the eye in February when, at his first campaign event in Melbourne in Florida, he froze a background president's plane, and he grows up in the Twitter account with messages complaining about how his predecessor's plane was being used.
'Valgel Maja is very pleased with the presentation of 'made in America', where products from all 50 states produced by American workers from American materials were represented,' said Lindsay Walters, acting counsel for the White House of Representatives.
The HMX-1 teams often try out flights around Washington and in the south in order to get to the US President, the White House, with a load of centimetres.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 Summit in early July, the HMX-1 White House underwent 58 trials.
According to the official, the flight to the event 'Made in America' was included as the norm for the study flights during that month.
The helicopters of the ambassador flew for an additional 11 hours on that day for 'support missions not linked to the President'.
According to the White House, none of the other exporters of this event were burdened with taxpayers' money.
The Sikorsky representative said that the company had nothing to do with organising the operation of the helicopter in the South.
HMX-1 does not retain the budgetary documents of the President's flights and it is difficult to identify the exact costs arising from the event.
But, according to the Ministry of Defence's prices for the financial year 2017, the VH-3D payout is USD 24 380 per hour.
The ambulance documented 30 minutes' flight time from the Quantico naval airport in Virginia, on both sides, to the flight's main base.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is well below that amount.
'Calculating the costs of taxpayers on the basis of estimated compensatory amounts is highly misleading,' said Walters.
'These estimated compensation amounts include personnel, maintenance and many other irrevocable costs which are taken into account for the annual appropriations.'
According to the RAND survey in 2015, the Ministry of Defence's reimbursements do not include personnel costs, but they cover costs related to fuel, maintenance and contracts.
The former spokesman of Valge Maja, Sean Spicer, defended the use of a helicopter during the event.
'The point is to show what has been done in America this week,' said Spicer.
'And I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are presumably hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment on which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
So, of course, it is right to highlight this."
It is not clear whether Trump was touched by a helicopter during a tour in the south as part of the event, but he was behind the fire-fighting car.
In the White House, Trump Sikorsky appealed to the media by publishing a joke about the company's products in its own aircraft business.
'I know Sikorsky very well,' the President said, 'I have three of their products.'
Grit Šadeiko: tears for peace and joy
During the 2011 World Cup in Daegus, Šadeyc hit the last area, 800 m ran into a stadium and was taken off with a roll-off.
Shortly before that he had received a zero score from a universe held in China.
In 2012, Helsinki EM was the beneficiary of a low-cost injury, but during a debate in London, it won its 23rd seat at 6013 points.
However, the misfortune has continued.
The Moscow MM 2013 received a corpse injury as a prestigious driver on the Estonian Record's graph after the opening day.
Two years later, he won the 15th venue at the Beijing World Cup and met the Olympic standard, but this, too, was disappointing for an athlete.
The most difficult environmentalist through Šadeiko has only begun to fade if he did not first receive a letter from the Amsterdam EM in a remote jump.
I would just like to put together, if only once, a proper multiplier competition.
One time', said Šadeiko.
The worst was still to come: one month later, his Olympic competition was already interrupted by a runaway in Rio.
Time had to be taken - did seven competitions ever have to be continued?
Is the effort of two days worth all this?
They were thought for a long time but found peace.
I had the good fortune to think about it!
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal ourselves and to think again.
'I knew I would not put my bag in the bag,' says Šadeiko.
I had a clean slap on the hat and I was able to keep up the momentum.
Treener Anne Mägi said that it was very difficult to see the pain of the caretaker, but he understood that, above all, the athlete himself had to get to the bottom of things.
After all, he was so desecrated by everyone.
It was difficult to tolerate.
'But Grit said he would not give up and he wanted to prove what he was worth,' says Mägi.
He is now at some sort of peace.
He will do so to his delight.
The competition came back in May, when Šadeiko set up a new Estonian record of 6280 items in the Götz Multi-Annual Competition.
In a high-level competition, she improved her personal top march by nearly one metre (13.89) and ran a record-breaking time.
At the time, the multiplier felt that it was not a hole of ability at all, but that it was eradicated from the first competition stage.
Ms Mägi, who guided her for years, says that Šadeiko is a gypsy student.
She is a ready-made sportsman and a good trainer.
If something is going wrong or is going wrong, he will say so immediately.
He knows his own body and trusts in his feelings.
That is what we have to build on.
I cannot say exactly what needs to be done and we will follow it.
A new approach has also been found in Šadeiko.
'I am not the one who makes the bar to the maximum', he says, and he says that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also guarantees a good result.
Happy New Year
Good emotions have also offered proximity.
Both his former training companion, Maris Mägi, and the nursery Grete, have recently become parents, and the contestant has received support from new weather citizens.
'There has been a great deal of interest,' says Šadeiko.
One alcohol whose consumption equals the brain's 'training'.
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that he believes - wine can teach the brain better than anything else in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
What he said was not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about 'very active' tasting of wine.
By sticking to a glass, by stirring up the wine, by enjoying it and by tasting it, we are putting our brain to work to create a taste for the wine.
According to a shepherd, wines do not actually taste, but taste comes from the way wine stimulates the brain.
It is a comparison of how the brain 'sees' colour.
'Map is not in wine, taste creates taste in wine', says Sheperd.
The things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender and even the amount of hearts that man produces.
Sheperd, of course, tells us that wine is not there to drink itself full.
'There must be more in action', he says.
If you take too much logo, the system is overloaded.
Excessive wine-making can harm the brain instead of benefiting it: according to a study from 2004, people who drink more than three classes with wine, memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity.
10% of workers in the Estonian ICT sector earn less than their colleagues
Figures by staff firm Fontes reveal that 10% of workers in the ICT sector in Estonia earn less than their colleagues.
The 10% pay gap is between men and women, writes the portal in Geneva.
59 IT and telecom companies participated in the pay survey for the ICT sector.
In total, 8 577 posts were examined.
63% of positions were occupied by men.
"Although only 3 companies have stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and the rest of the companies believe that there is no pay gap, in reality the average monthly salary for men is 10% higher than that of women, and the total annual salary for men is 8% higher than that of women on average," said Mr. Fontes's analyst, Mr. Nordic.
"Narcose" 3-season advertisement: Now that Pablo Escobar has gone, Netflix's cartel will take centre stage in Cali cartel
Despite the fact that in the second season of Narcos, Pablo Escobar's killer was exposed, the saga of Netflix is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the fluctuation system, and the first has already been completed by a promotional clip which will crack down on a series of new malignants.
In the third season, DEA is turning its attention to the world's richest drug organisation, the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful crusaders, 'like Fortune 500 companies', simply with more bribes to the government and more violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the cartel leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is leading relations with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) is based in New York.
The newly released advertisement consists of Pedro Pascal returning to Javier Penana, a figure recruiting for American and Colombian law enforcement in the war against drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of 'Narcos' will open on 1 September.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
The head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, Nicholas Haysom, said that hundreds of women were standing for local council elections, three women were standing for Vice-President and more than 30% of recently registered voters were women.
'It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of the role of women,' she said in the statement made on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women are fully involved and involved at all stages of the electoral process.
The local council elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have, for their part, threatened the electoral process, which coincides with a transition period when the role of international military operations becomes advisable.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is being transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
"The strong role of women will contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the independent Afghan Electoral Commission, 1.2 million women out of 3.6 million registered voters are registered.
The joy of distribution makes every thing more heated, both large and small.
The time is always too short, but with the strikes, it is a good opportunity to combine coexistence, games, proximity and load.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you are in the summer, living goodbyes will always be with you and will impatiently remind you of your peer-reviewed foam: 'Let's make a leap now'.
Starting with warming, it is very good to have a normal gold plate or a shore strip.
Is there a basis for stacking in the shape of footwear and ash - who would then like to take the form of a sand that has been washed from the waves during the summer?
It is fashionable to have children instead of chickens!
Firstly, it is safe and comfortable, and the difficulties are gradually increasing at the same pace as the forces of the trainer.
Successful ones can also do with quite large children.
A child develops a balance, counts repetitions and misses the opportunity to be tall and important.
Larger children can, at the same time, make up their own backyard.
The extent of the movement is determined by land grabbing and hands being wrapped.
Hang your fingers straight, ask the miniature to stick properly.
A child can read repetitions and feel trained.
The planet is extremely useful, but it is a hopelessly boring exercise for the child.
But it is easy to relax!
A toy plank: take a long plastic bag that you have to jump through one by one.
In fact, it is more difficult than normal, but much easier to do than giving a friend a hand in the meantime.
In order to add weight to the weight, it is possible to stay in the form of a plastic, a small piece of paper, and to walk around in this position.
An additional difficulty may be to sit down in a baby's cages, but this exercise offers a free ride for all children.
While crabs in the sand are targeted, tricks, ash and diarrhoea strains such as the infection.
A child goes to his feet in such a way that his or her body is equally distributed in advance and behind.
You can hold your hands tied to security.
Hit your feet and walk right up.
You can fly, relax, train the balance and be difficult.
The life of a small trainer is an extravagant when he gets a little bit of muscle at every turn.
An extra burden is placed on foot-and-mouth.
I will make sure that the back stays in a neutral position.
Children themselves have a lot of fun to do with diarrhoea in a couple and in a plaque.
Taste and powder.
Follow the child's safety, the substitution of the generation, and keep your back in a neutral position.
All children's favourite and great fun!
At the same time, the parent will be truly effective throughout the body's treasure.
The sports equipment was Ott (10), Säde (8), St. Petersburg (4).
From the Philippines to the heart of the wider world, the apple sailed to the hearts of the Moldovans
Butter bags buried in the holes are a summer class that has in recent years become home to home-grown tears, which one of the right summer-makers has had to hang at your fingertips and which, despite its modest origin, traders have been able to fix an appropriate price tag for their bars.
A puppet bag burdened with holes is probably one of those things that have existed in the life of an eternal order and which have not aroused much emotion.
It simply exists, and if it does not exist, then there is nothing wrong.
Now, however, straw-jackets are making a real race, and fashion fans have switched their fine designer cartridges for summer months against rather simple, hard-pressed bags.
This is not only a coastal bag, but today it is also just as popular as a street bag, with more courageous women even walking into the office.
However, it is worth making it clear, before the Supreme Court, whether this summer's look will still be sitting or whether it will still be worthwhile to push the wedding and laptop to a slightly more official level.
However, the exchange rate has made beer bags a real summer resort for women.
For example, when reading foreign moeblologists, the first thing that stands out is that mosques drive local markets as the first thing to do when they go on holiday, and acquire a few shoes that are then the trump card of the whole holiday season and which go along with the beach, the market and also with friends in the village.
Some bloggers are even so generous as to buy a bigger jacket on the market and sell or give it to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so high that women (and men!) in the countries of origin would probably hold dear each other in order to be able to take some of their bags as happy owners.
In a way, this madness is also understandable, as it is rare for it to be possible to buy one of the things that have gone up in the field of development for a mere EUR 10.
True, cumbersome traders have also discovered a simple way of making money here, and so the finest luxury brands are selling beer bears for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Obviously, in order that wealthier customers should not feel like ordinary customers promoting themselves with some low-cost bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana an oil box worth over EUR 1 000.
For Chanel's interpretation of the case, a sum of EUR 6 000 may be displayed.
However, unlike most mosques, petroleum bags do not come from some large molluscs, but their history originated far from them.
Specifically, these tar bags allegedly originate far from the Philippines, where they have been spread without any coverage.
Sleeping bags are primarily exporters there, and local rounds with them are very often not seen.
It is claimed that the brewing technique dates back to the 14th century and is quite a surreptitious drop in the usual pattern.
However, since the beer bag does not have to bury as much as the ear, it is inundated with gypsies and other materials that make the bag more personalised and, by extension, more responsive.
Recently, for example, there are particularly trend-rich bags containing dyed-in-coloured bags or leather bags.
This letter of thanks can be sent in particular to the actress Jane Birkin, the biggest ticked beetle of whom had never been seen before.
Namely, he fitted the minnow bag to all sorts of clothing packs and did not even consider it a great deal to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
However, the popularity of homes nowadays does not have a lesser role to play, either, because caring for them is a boom age and, unlike any other type of jungle, they do not have to be cared for by special means, but also by water and wet junk.
As in the case of trendy robberies, over and above the classic appearance, brands have come out with all sorts of interpretations.
For example, if you want to, you can have a bundled powder of shoulders or a tiny bouquet of shoulders.
It is worth remembering, however, that the classic beetle never goes from mo to beer.
But what is the classic beer?
For centuries now, this bundled bag of beer, which resembles a moon in its style, has been classed as open and short, as well as beer, sandy.
Five healthy glaciers that are miraculously easy to prepare at home
Mr Lifehack.org pointed out ways of producing different types of icebreakers at home, containing fewer calories than debris.
Birthday and predators - throwing a large amount of rubbish with sugar, adding a con and a bolt, and mixing everything into a homogenous mass, put the fuse into the cold.
Shock and nuts - trouble the Greek yoghurt, frozen bananas, cocoa powder and thread to the same weight.
Then you add a little bit of rubbish to the mix and then you have a couple of seconds of mixing.
The ice is ready for immediate meals.
Swine fever - a mixture of skimmed milk, sugar substitute, egg, frozen or normal peaches and continental textiles into a homogeneous mass and put the mixture into the cold.
Poacound ice - a problem of coconut, cocaine browser, vanilla extract, watertight and frozen bananas, and put the resulting mixture in the fridge.
Banana ice - why on earth frozen banana pieces with low-fat milk as a homogeneous mass, served with Greek nuts and consumed immediately.
They were pet homes on the property market in July - stylish, expensive and luxurious!
Summer is a great time to build, search and repair a home.
What were the most attractive experiences of visiting the City24.ee property portal in July?
The interest was provided by houses or houses in the most expensive price class.
It is probably the hunt and the wet weather that makes the summer more to dream of washing its hair and salt.

The missing man was found on the island three days ago
Aare left his home at Kärla, in an unknown direction, on Wednesday evening.
The last contact by telephone was yesterday evening on Friday evening, and the position position of the telephone assigned the man to the west of Saare, the village of some, where he was searched with a helicopter to the depths of the night and with his dog to the early morning.
His phone subsequently ran aground and his whereabouts were therefore no longer verifiable.
The police continued their search this morning.
The police thank everyone who contributed to finding the Aare.
GMB is concerned about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The company expects confirmation from the managers of the mature manufacturer McVitie of long-term production plans at the Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company has remained silent on the future of the Tollcross site.
More than 500 people are employed in a factory that produces cooked milk from Hobnobs and Rich Tea and other products.
The McVitie owner, Pladis, said that they have invested over GBP 5 million in the object over the last few years.
It employed more workers and the trade union chairmen 'are the first to hear' when something changes in the plant's operation.
In a letter to the head of the company, the GMB Scotland company McVitie addressed a request to 'address concerns that the funding will not be used to modernise production lines'.
The GMB Chief Operator Drew Duffy said: 'The fact that we are not getting clarity from the head of the object on Tollcross' business needs and the future investment plan is a cause of deep concern to our members.
Families of several generations have been working here, and the workforce largely consists of the local community and the people around Glasgow, being an essential pillar for ensuring proper employment in a region of high unemployment and social exclusion.
So, against the backdrop of jobs, wages and welfare in the East of Glasgow, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rise in living costs and the chronic shrinking of production, a thriving and growing company in McVitie urgently needs Glasgow."
The representative of the company said: 'The head of the Tollcross site received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will reply directly to him because we value active communication with workers and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between workers and GMB representatives in Tollcross where a number of issues were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we would be reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all of our businesses and to all our objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: 'In recent years, we have invested over GBP 5 million in the Tollcross site, most of it going into production lines and improving operations.
We fully understand Tollcross as a legacy of an object of production, and if there should be any change in the object's operation, the workers and the trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it.'
Has the PSG warned Barcelona three years ago about drawing closer to Neymar?
La Liga regrets his interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain is not giving up on trying to lure Neymar into its ranks by making an offer of GBP 189 million to buy him, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record voyage of conquest?
This bumpy approach has opened up as a transitional club for the summer and the Ligue 1 club is ready to crack more than twice the current world record of overbuying, which was erected during the last season with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for GBP 89 million.
Once the changeover is completed, Neymaris will become the world's most expensive player and also the most highly paid professional player in the world, who will earn over GBP 500 000 a week after payment from the PSG.
Barcelona is, of course, angry, both for the way in which it approached it and for breaking free of Neymar, although the source close to the Catalans governing board confirms that the club has always cared for the best of its football since its arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the President of the PSG warn the football world about this possibility three years ago?
While Manchester City showed interest in concluding the Blaise Matuid contract in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif strongly warned all clubs thinking about recruiting some of the best PSG players.
'I am not worried because they know that when they concern some of our players, we will meet them and contact their players,' said Al-Khelaif.
'We respect all clubs.
But when they try to contract with some of our players, they have to face the consequences.'
Barcelona seems to have surpassed that limit, as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in the central player of the PSG, Marco Verratt.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow an Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer a setback as a result of this interest, losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
'Brex is seriously threatened with a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland', warned Mr Varadkar on his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June.
'I cannot imagine who would benefit from this,' he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods, says Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders," she underlined.
According to an early bear, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and, as it is not, to remain part of the common European market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish Prime Minister explained.
Marking that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: 'Certainly we could have this with Britain'.
The alternative would be to return to the customs points, which would herald historic division and political failure.
'Get serious about trade, prosperity and peace', the Irish Prime Minister said.
He called Brexit 'our generation's challenge' and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of daily life in Northern Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when he visited Belfast.
Nart Avand, who passed her first-and-a-half-long triangle: Ironman can be passed by anyone.
Today, in the winter capital, Otepää, the biggest tri-festival in the Baltic States was held, with around one thousand triangles from over thirty countries at the contest for a half-long Ironman.
The 70.3-mile distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of bicycle and 21.1 km of bicycle riding.
Among others, Nart Avand ended his life victoriously in the first triangle.
'I thought it would be difficult and eventually it was difficult' said Avand in finishing.
In spite of the complexity, Avandi stated that the trinity is actually a fitting head for everyone.
'Not distance kills, but speed kills', he said, insinuating that at a given pace everyone ends up in the final stage.
Except for Ott Sepp: 'All's well with Oti physics, but unfortunately he can't swim'.
Avandi had already been on a large scale since February.
Between 4 and 5 hours a week, and 10 hours a week later.
At 5:34:12 he reached 270 on the overall score.
Although Avandi lost both Raio Piirojale (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligile (time 05:06:37), she won other competitions in the so-called "promotion class."
Tanel Padar, who was last year's 'good example person', lost to Avand in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about one hour (time from 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
The overall winner of the Otepää stage for the calculation of the men in Ironman series was chronically German, Johannes Moldan, by 3:58:27; the best of the Estonians was Ivo the Great Time 04:14:09.
Among women, the Dane, Helle Frederitung, won 04:24:01, but the Estonians, Maria Jänese, who lost almost half an hour to Frederist and won 04:58.
Avandi went through a swimming distance of 1.9 km in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
She came out of the water at 410.
