In Estonia and Spain, four members of the Kemerovo group were detained
According to Postimees, the police in Spain were arrested by Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo grouping in Estonia, who is known as Slava Kemerovsky in a criminal world.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with permission from the court.
Yesterday, the court seized three suspects arrested in Estonia.
According to suspicion, they are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal association aged 27-57, who mainly deal with drug crimes.
An alleged leader of a criminal organization was detained in Mijas in the province of Malaga, Spain.
In Estonia, three men were detained as suspects, one of them according to the collected data, is the leader of a criminal organization, and two are members of a criminal association.
The data collected indicates that there was a clear division of tasks and roles in the criminal organization.
The activities of the criminal association were aimed at committing drug crimes and thereby earning a criminal proceeding, "commented the head of the pre-trial proceedings in the criminal matter, the public prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out that the number of suspects in this criminal case will increase," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the forefront of law enforcement agencies, and some have been punished for drug offenses.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues played an important role throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," commented Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Department, said that pre-trial detention was preceded by a year and a half pre-trial investigation.
"During the first half of the week, long-term work was realized, and we both simultaneously suspected that they were suspected of having committed crime in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that the officers of the Central Criminal Police were in detention in Spain.
For years, we have good contacts and understanding with the Spanish police and civilian card patrol.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can get them from another European end, "said Leis.
The information gathered so far unambiguously indicates that, in the time of freedom, suspected men may continue to commit new crimes, the Prosecutor's Office requested the arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia.
Real estate, vehicles and cash are seized in order to secure confiscation in this criminal case.
Pre-trial proceedings in criminal cases are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Office of Organized Crime and headed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In the Tallinn City Court, Slava Gulevichi was convicted of extortion in 2005 and sentenced him to five years' imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevichi was considered to be the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world, after the then underworld Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevit≈°, who came from Kemerovo, rose in the underworld of Estonia in the early 1990's when he started racking up in Tallinn.
She allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes at various hotels and demanded a monthly rooftop payment from businessmen.
International joint operations, seizures of criminal proceeds and enforceable judgments confirm that the fight against organized crime is effective.
For example, the latest judgments, the eight defendants detained in the Dikajev Criminal Community, from which the proceeds of confiscation were seized at EUR 80,000, or a judgment against nine people, alleging that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association in 2006 to commit illegal smuggling and trafficking in illicit cigarettes in Ida-Viru County and Southern Estonia.
The amount of confiscated criminal proceeds is about EUR 71,500.
The success of these criminal cases is that policemen exchange information with foreign colleagues and prosecutors on a daily basis and, if necessary, carry out operations in any of the countries of the European Union.
The Citizens' Rights Group warns Missouri about traveling
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri for discriminatory State policies and racist attacks.
The group statement states: "The NAACP Travel Memorandum issued by the State of Missouri, valid until August 28, 2017, invites all African-American travelers, visitors, and missouri to be particularly vigilant and extremely cautious when traveling around the state, taking into account all sorts of suspicious racial events that have recently occurred and are outlined here."
According to the NAACP, the group urged the travel warnings to be issued by the recent Missouri law, which makes it harder to win discrimination cases, as well as the fact that the targets of state law enforcers are unequally largely minorities.
"Citizens' rights are violated.
They are pulled on the teeth edge due to their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said President of the NAACP Missouri branch, Rod Chapel, to The Kansas City Star.
"We have never received such complaints in the past."
This is the first such alert issued by the organization for the United States.
The group referred to events such as racist assassinations of black students at Missouri University and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black woman from Tennessee.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year in suspicious circumstances after he was fired by gas from the state and Missouri police arrested him without being charged with a criminal offense.
In addition, the reference points to a recent report by the Attorney General's office in Missouri, which shows that the state of the Black Sea motor car fleet is being stopped by 75% more likely than the white-collar ones.
"The note is intended to make people aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be ready, it means either taking a bailout or informing relatives that they are going through the state."
Based on the latest FBI hacking program information, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, placing the number of similar offenses in the state at 16th place across the state.
A travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it harder for businesses to sue for discrimination in housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU had previously issued travel notes for Texas and Arizona after these states adopted immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration offenses, according to the ACLU, according to ACLU, increasing racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but interest groups have recently started to use this measure as a response to certain US laws and trends.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about the various forms of this serious illness?
Hepatitis or inflammation of the liver can be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All these viruses cause liver tissue acute inflammation.
Neurological costs, however, are chronic hepatitis B and C, which may develop into liver cirrhosis, or liver wrinkle and liver counts.
Audiologist Epidemiology Advisor Kuulo Kutsar says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gray stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last symptom of the disease is the popular name of the inflamed liver, jaundice.
In children, hepatitis can develop without any disease.
Various types of inflammation of the liver can be determined only on the basis of laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can go over chronic hepatitis and develop for decades without illness, which means that a person may not know anything about his dangerous liver-damaging illness.
Listening Kutsar brings out different hepatitis forms and describes their course more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person to humans and infect us when we eat contaminated food or drink water, sex, infected human stools from the hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, mouth and drug use.
Hazardous or hepatitis A infections are those at risk for family members and carers of a sick person, people with chronic liver disease, sexually transmitted infections, men who have sex with men, drug users, travelers visiting Hepatitis A countries.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, and in particular, vaccination is recommended for people who travel heavily and hepatitis A to a large number of people.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before eating.
Hepatitis B virus spreads when exposed to a patient's blood, injections of drugs, tattooing, harboring, using bloody contaminated household dentifrices (toothbrushes, shaving facilities), donor blood, sexually transmitted hepatitis, and hepatitis, from mother to fetus / newborn.
Hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug users, sexually transmitted infections, male sex workers, infected mother's newborn, sick family members and caregivers, healthcare, rescue workers and police officers and blood-borne hepatitis B high-risk travelers.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people, in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk and in addition to people with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and people with diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of strangers' hygiene and manicures, other sharps and needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of a condom for sexually transmitted infections or the prevention of sexual risk behaviors.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunization program in Estonia and free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses spread by contacting the sick with human blood, by injecting drugs, tattooing, harboring, using bloody contaminated household doses, donor blood, sexually transmitted hepatitis, and hepatitis-related illness from mother to fetus / neonate.
Hepatitis C infection at risk includes injecting drug users, sexually transmitted infections, male sex workers, newborn infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, healthcare, rescue and police officers, HIV-infected people and people with high-incidence of hepatitis C infection.
Hepatitis C prevention measures include: avoiding the use of strangers' hygiene and manicures, other sharps and needles, tattooing and piercing, and using a condom for sexually transmitted infections.
Hepatitis C does not have a vaccine.
Hepatitis D causes hepatitis D virus, which is multiplied in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
Consequently, hepatitis D infection is associated with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
Hepatitis D viruses spread in contact with blood and other body fluids, contaminated syringes with needles, sexually transmitted and infrequently infected from mother to fetus.
Hazardous hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who are not immune to hepatitis B virus.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with a hepatitis B vaccine that protects people from infection with hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses spread through drinking water and food on a fecal-oral route, including little cooked beef, fish and shellfish eating, donor blood, syringes, and infected mother-fetuses.
Passengers may be infected with hepatitis E in high-risk countries.
E hepatitis prevention measures are filling hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after care of the patient.
Fruit and vegetables should be washed before consumption, avoid eating fewer cooked beef, fish and seafood, drinking only safe drinking water and avoiding drug use.
Although on the last round the competitors tried to squander the four-time Olympic winner on the track, the 34-year-old Farah came to power at the end and won 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long, pulling after her finish with her husband Tania and children.
It was a special moment for me.
I am very happy with my family.
It was wonderful to have them on the track, "Farah told reporters.
Farah targets the fifth title race in London for a row of 5,000 and 10,000 meters running golden dungeons.
Everything is possible if you believe in this religion.
In spite of the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Lady of the Glove", an extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the Adele Bloch-Bauer portrait, dives into a much deeper cultural history of the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.
But even more in the history.
An awesome infusion of the inflorescence, or a harder crop, would be worse, with the narrower subject falling into the caption of the captured portrait on an extraordinary occasion to gain more influence.
At the moment there would be two books between two covers: Gustav Klimt and Adele Bloch-Bauer's painting "The Lady of Gold", and a much larger and more extensive history story of the esteemed Jewish families and the German occupation, with its aftermaths in Austria.
The first third of the book leads in the midst of the vibrant Vienna cultural life, and who has fallen into the Austrian capital itself, can easily imagine how more than a hundred years ago lived around Ringstrasse, or how all the heads of the Central Caf√© turned when Klimt came in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities of Europe, and when you saw the familiar name in the book, you feel like a grammar more cultured.
However, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where there was an incurable syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe makes it seem like nothing to do with development.
Perhaps, however, every pair of chisel brushes add colors to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
A dream trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the Jewish population in Vienna has exploded dramatically, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
During the turn of the century, almost every ten residents of Vienna were Jews.
Adele's parents were newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele had married a double queen to the Czech sugar agate Ferdinand Bloch and Klimt was pestered for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adlelet did not pull the whole glamorous life into which he belonged.
When you look at "Lady of Gold", it's hard to believe that this gorgeous lady of socialism was infected by the end of life and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order the portrait of his husband from Klimti, he was the last hot spot painter in Vienna.
Klimt's order paid 4000 kroons at that time, a quarter of the cost of a good house in the country.
The fact that some of the portraits suspected the master of love as a model did not deceive the sugar agate.
As for Adelse, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and artist that came up with the work continued until the end of life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Lady of Gold.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer portrait of an extraordinary story, "Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before Adele's work, Klimt went to the Ravennas San Vitale Basilica, and the researchers believe that the glorious mosaics from the Emperor Theodoras, which were there, gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adela's painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Lady of Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and about the same time (1907-1908), another "golden kiss" was born in the golden country.
Art historians did not miss the similarity of the two women.
How is Hitler related to the story?
Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote to the director of the Belvedere Museum a couple of years after leaving the artist (Klimt died in February 1918), and wished that their family's Klimt collection would go to the museum, "I think that I owe him credit for his friend Klimt.
Six years before his death, Adelest's other portrait was made in Klimt.
Also in his will (Adele left in February 1925), she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscapes to the Austrian Gallery.
Her jewelry was inherited by her nieces Mariale and Luis.
One year after Klimt had graduated from the Austrian Mona Lisa, he was attempting to enter Adolf Hitler's 17-year-old admission to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, but failed to draw a drawing.
Although the reason for Hitler's subsequent anti-Semitism is sometimes that the Jewish professors did not accept him at the academy, none of his examiners was actually a Jew.
In any case, the mission of the Austrian Gallery referred to in the will of Maria was considerably changed by 1939 - it was important to find the desirable works of the Nazi brethren from the rich Jewish collections of art in Vienna.
Some of Adele's homework, but not Klimt's, were suitable for Hitler's personal art work.
Sixty years after the Nazi armed robbery, a ten-year litigation between the Austrian government and the heirs of Bloch-Bauer began.
In this regard, it is only noted that if "Kiss" is seen at the Belvedere Castle in Vienna, then Adele Bloch-Bauer's "Lady of Gold" will have to go to New York's Neue Gallery to visit New York.
And before the Vienna ride, read the book above.
Even when you do not plan on going to Klimt's work, at least my emotions revolved around the closure of the book after the Nazi and Jewish theme, with around $ 135 million worth of paintings and the Adele Bloch-Bauer model.
So not so much a portrait as a family story rather a fate - and a very moving story.
Significantly, orienteering was facilitated by the Bauer family tree, which was originally introduced.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to Estonia's record in Canada
In the prediction, Gold was very close to the 2.16.62 pace for a 200 m spin on its own record.
Tippmark comes from a 17-year-old one week ago, when the Canadian Junior Championship was 2.16.58, Priit Aaviku's Swim blog.
Gold escaped the last, or the tenth, A-finals.
At the finals, he traveled with a distance of 2.15.76 and got a good seventh place with a new powerful tip.
Alina Kendzior's Estonian record (2.15.13) dropped to Goldi just over half a second.
In Estonia's all-time high, Gold rose third, and its fresh personal highlight is the fifth result of Estonia's all-time history.
The future of the young is still in the Canadian Adult Championships 100m, 200m and 400m long, and 200m and 400m in combination.
Last week, Toronto hosted the Canadian Junior Championship, and Gold made some successful starts there.
He won the silver medal at a rate of 2.03.22 in 200 m.
So quickly, this distance was flooded by Estonians last year in 2008.
Gold is faster than ever in Estonia, but Estonia's record-breaking Elina Part√µka has flown this distance.
A resident of Canada, the winner of the bronze medal in a 100m win with an excellent personal record and 56.66 in the new season of Estonia won.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, the older one, swam at this distance by only one hundredth of a second faster.
At the personal peak, he reached another 100 m on his back when he got a message in the opening conversation with the time of the letter 1.03,69.
For a long distance, he reached only seventh place when he scored 2,17,31 in the final.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season's chart on four different distances.
President Trump is on vacation, critics sharpen their teeth
There is a time of holidays - that is, relaxation for US President Donald Trump.
Since Trump has, however, hitherto been one of the most recruited presidents, critics sharpen their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president plans to have a 17-day holiday in a family-run golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president's holiday began yesterday, short-term opponents of the holiday have already spoken for weeks.
They give too much rest to Trump.
Namely, the president has the habit of spending weekend vacations in his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
Incidentally, Trump has not rested the president for 196 days in the most.
George W. Bush, for example, had 67 days off on vacation, Barack Obama, half less than Trump, only 21 days.
However, Trump quickly tends to forget about things.
Reading days after becoming president, Trump said on "60 minutes" that he will not miss the time spent on his long-term holidays, as much needs to be done.
He also resented Barack Obama's holidays three years ago.
The current president wrote in Twitter: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending festivities and jazz concerts, the ISIS journalists are missing out on their heads."
According to White House officials, a visit to the 17-day golf club is not a kind of relaxation.
It's officially referred to as a work holiday, during which Trump has no time for reading or other fun activities.
In addition, there was a second reason for holidays.
In fact, the White House's western air conditioner system is being replaced and therefore all the staff had to leave.
In the western part there is also the Oval Chamber and other presidential offices.
"I do not think that anyone would want to be in the west in August if it is 38 degrees and does not have air conditioning," said Lindsay Walters, White House spokeswoman, who stressed that the president will continue to work during the holidays.
From where President Trump will spend 17 days, you will get an idea of the video.
Blocking Critics from Facebook Do not apply to the state office if you can not stand the criticism of voters.
The father of our country knew so much about unfavorable media coverage.
Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers did not go long enough to begin to smack him for everything from internal politics to politics.
The criticism naturally irritated him.
But he did not force his critics to silence.
Because in 1783 Washington said that "freedom of speech can be taken away from us, and in silence and silence, we may be led by the sheep as heads of worship".
It brings me to Larry Hogan, the Governor of Maryland, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan subordinates have blocked and deleted at least 450 posts posted on their official Facebook page for their opinions.
And at the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) complained about him.
The governor's office stammered the claim null and the web commented on the responses in the style of "Who cares?".
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But it counts.
And this is especially true when it comes to a man like Hogan.
He is an incredibly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His approval percentage is ranked second among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan does not have a dazzling reaction.
He has steered the state firmly and remains rigorous in its principles.
In addition, he has used the Facebook media as the main tool for communicating with his voters, for example, after giving chewing gum for the first time since chemotherapy.
Thus, the Governor's Page, which is an officially-tagged public forum managed by the blocking of visiting people visiting taxpayers' dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
The Hogan spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended The Washington Post's interview with governor's behavior, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of web crawling internet vendors, spammers, or hate-filled people.
The Post spoke to several real people whose Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they are, really, people who interact with their chosen leaders. Teacher, business owner and pastor, not Internet controllers.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and hardly anything.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing the Hogan Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, a lawyer from Maryland's Bowie, did not provoke hatred, but about hate crimes.
"I commented courtesy that I was disappointed that he had not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in The Post News Feed's commentary.
"I also do not like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same subject, they call it immediately indifferent to a collective effort, rather than to admit that it is a great deal of concern for the citizens."
What the governor's office called "targeted spam attacks" would probably call others "public support".
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor messages by simply blocking criticism or deleting a negative comment.
The thing is much cleaner than in the old days when, for the same reason, they had to send out the staff to collect newspapers with critical journals and burn them up or arrest protesters and force them to silence.
But exactly what is happening right now, just digital.
Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter.
One of the first indications of this issue was made last week in Virginia.
James C. Cacher, US District Judge, decided in Alexandria that chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first amendment to the Constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
Kentucky also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) to use ACLU for Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be so difficult.
In Washington, affordable postal charges had a similar effect on the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous writers tore down on its management.
And even then, Washington had to thrash the anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers based on such pseudonyms as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington's decisions on earth.
According to historic documents gathered in the context of a web-based George Washington letter collection project, he cemented the cabinet's petitions criticizing his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he did not force them to silence.
Freedom of speech, dissent and debate are fundamental to our country.
And the right leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of the Home Territory in the Renaissance Club
The former European title, Ronan Rafferty, hopes for the comfort of the home territory in the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the golf courses of the East Lothian Renaissance Club.
The North Rider, who was leading the neighboring Archerfield Links race last year before leading Paul Eales to the last round, is fond of the new venue and serves as a tournament ambassador instead of the club's founder and chief executive Jerry Sarvad.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we see how the club will glow at this event in full glory," Rafferty said.
"Players see the track in its best shape, it's in a brilliant state.
Jerry has done an excellent job at building this place.
He is an eager supporter of the golf game and feels proud of what has been achieved here.
This will allow the track to be displayed perfectly. "
Angela Eales expects her to be the first to defend the championship, although the man has won both his European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It sends a very special feeling," said Nazionale in Southporti.
"I could not defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken one year after my victory in the fixture list.
The magician has been returned to it.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, and for my and my wife Sharon, the victory of last year was special.
It was a very special time that we will always wear in our hearts. "
On the homeland, Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Fellowship earlier this year, when he was 50, will return to the competition.
This is his first event in Scotland after 2013 to participate in Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"It's always a little more meaningful to play at home," said Orr, a Helensburger man.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel extra strain.
I've enjoyed the game immensely and played a rather decent golf game.
I am pleased with the progress of things so far. "
The former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and the senior tourists champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty join the Trio.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the competition, with the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free and car parking costs ¬£ 5 for a single passenger and ¬£ 10 for car with two or more passengers.

Poverty and death in Indonesia's golden-haired country
When Bardina Degei prepares dinner, she does not use the stove.
He even rarely uses the pot.
In a wooden lumber house located in Enarotal, in the capital of Panay, in the province of Papua in the province of Papua, a housewife places a potato called nota as a local language directly into the fire.
After half an hour, take the charred tub from the fire and wash your skin with ease with your hands.
Degey does not have furniture on the floor on mud, and in that same place he does his daily housework, for example, washing his lingerie with muddy water from the nearby sex.
The role of a towel is filled with a bucket in a rooftop room.
Since she is the youngest of her four women, she is not assigned to take care of any field.
Polygamy is normal here.
However, working in the late may be dangerous. Most of the village men are unemployed and many are drinking hard, and there are also soldiers here.
"No one dare walk around the village after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
This is a rare glimpse of the Papua New Guinea, a former Dutch colony that was joined by Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum that forced only 1026 elderly people to cast their votes under the arms of the occupying forces.
The drive for liberation from Dutch domination has quickly fueled its rage against the Jakarta government, which still holds the region under its strong control, keeping away from foreign journalists and human rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua New Guinea and Papua New Guinea, eastern Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is a remote and abandoned place altogether. To reach this destination, you must fly to Jabalpur, the capital of the province, for 90 minutes to Nabir, and then go on a five-hour ride with a hire car.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covering wavy iron roofs, with rust-colored shades of yellow tones.
Very few Indo-Americans have taken the route here, let alone journalists, and there are almost no aliens here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago worshiped the god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not accustomed to wearing such clothes," says Degei, referring to her colorful hand-woven turban, dark blouse and vivid skirt.
"Before that, we only loaded the plants on the body."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's golden land.
Just 100 km from Paniaist, about 153,000 people in the mountainous province of New Jersey, Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, is located in Freeport McMoran, Phoenix.
In 2015 Freeport mines about $ 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from Freeport.
In addition, Papua can be proud of consumer supplies estimated at $ 78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering for the Sinai, as they are due to the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by the The New York Times newspaper showed that Freeport paid approximately $ 20 million to local troops and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $ 150,000 per officer.
The aspirations of Paapa to ensure greater autonomy are threatening this golden meadow and they are moving around abusively.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 baboons have been slaughtered since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by Indonesian armed forces.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the Massacre massacre in the highlands of Papua New Guinea in the 1970s was a genocidal one.
Last year alone, over 3900 peaceful protesters arrested Indonesian police.
The 2016 Report of the Bishopric of Birsbane, "We're Losing Everything," contains testimony to the atrocities committed in the past year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to another report, rapes and electric shocks are particularly common) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to read the number of victims, because such incidents occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screws are even more tight, as the natural resources of Papua New Guinea have caused the influx of New Zealand from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are Christians, but demographics are changing, as Indonesian populations of Jawa, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes are the Muslim emigrants.
Jaavaanded family baths sell gado-gado crisps and mixed vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Locals can not compete with them.
"Migrants began to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local cotton budgets," explains Abeth You, 24, born in Panios, who moved to Jayapur, the capital of the province, for work.
"The males of the Piraeus, the Papa's mama-mama [women], are losing their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widod, known among the people as Jokowi, promised in his 2014 campaign to address the inequalities and human rights abuses in Papua New Guinea.
The former carpenter won 27 of his 29 constituencies in Panama, including Panay, on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua there has been very little change, and the local people feel tired of it.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted in favor of Jokow in the hope that he will fulfill our hopes in restoring justice," says You.
In fact, Panie was in trouble just two months after Jokow's deployment in October.
On December 7th, 2014, 11 children at the Enarotalis sang a Christmas party when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on the motorcycle on darkness.
Fascinated children told them that they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers broke into their tone and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the drunken soldiers were kidnapped by children and beat them with their gun handles.
Then one of the soldiers fired among the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, was beaten so brutally that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby electoral committee building was burned and the next day things escalated even further.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered for a fair trial at the local police station and the military control center in front of the football field.
They wore ceremonial gulls and presented a waita-dance of Pago tribe in Paupua, where they drank around and bird songs were dug up.
Some protesters began to throw stones at the police and the military.
In the excitement of sorrow, a command was sent to the soldiers via the internal radio. "If the popular masses give more than three resistances, let them down," according to an official document that the magazine TIME has seen but not issued to local media outlets.
Senior Yeremias Kayame (56), a senior at the Kego Koto district of the city of Enarot, felt a threat and called for peace, asking the crowd to go home.
Nobody wanted to listen.
"Turning around, I shot abruptly into my left arm," he told TIME in his vivid colors on the wooden house veranda.
Kayame still does not know who was the shooter, but says that the ball came from accumulated soldiers' ranks.
"There was a lot of people, you got a lot of costumes," he adds.
The local man, Alfius Youw, said three times that he had shot his shotgun.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was with him," said YOHANE, the dark TIME magazine, who uses only one name for many Indo-Indians.
"I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him."
The General Inspector General of the Papua New Guinea, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his subordinates only provided security to their own department, as it was attacked.
"We must protect ourselves when we are threatened with death," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, Commissioner of the Pao Polo spokeswoman in 2015.
"This is the question of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the killings reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapoor held a passionate speech, expressing his sympathy with the families of the victims and allowing him to deal with mistreatment in Papua New Guinea.
"I want to resolve this incident immediately so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
Security Secretary Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would set up an out-of-court mechanism to deal with crimes against humanity.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
"Most of the crimes happened long ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes, "he said.
Speaking at TIME on June 5 in Jakarta, Wiranto took her words back, saying she had no intention of setting up a mechanism to deal with complaints in Papua New Guinea.
Instead, he said that "everything is settled by law".
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against humanity in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during a 1999 bloody referendum on independence, said that 11 delinquent human rights abuses have already been resolved in Papua, including Panyu.
The families of the victims of Panay took such arguments with grim confusion.
"I have been listened to four times over the past three years, but no progress has been made," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
She says she's still scared for years to come.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army arrests me, I'm afraid I'm shot."
His brother Yacobus affirmed that Paniai people were afraid of this incident.
He said he was beaten up by the military after he had helped kill four of the victims.
"After the burial of dead bodies, the army had to look for me," he says.
Shooting has not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers at Panyi neighborhood in Deiyais.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when he broke off between the villagers and the head of the construction company who refused to transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, drowned in the nearby river near the river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angered villagers protested at the building site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, villagers caught policemen with stones, on top of which the latter responded with warning signs.
But locally, the mobile brigade (the Indonesian militia police) started firing people killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, we're afraid of revenge," TIME told 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, living near a hospital and seeing injured people on the scene.
"I hid for two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police involved and the removal of the police mobile brigade from the region.
Panji has always been a problem spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the tribes of honey, monk, dani and damali living in the calm Middle Axis of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Popular Free Movement of Papal Movement (VPL) rebels army, which, according to them, is protecting the rights of the Pawi by organizing attacks and kidnapping in Indonesian soldiers.
Some leaders of the VPL are from Panja, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of protecting the sovereignty of the country, the army has arrested Panyev in recent years and detained thousands of people arbitrarily.
Some of them never come out again.
Panay people are known as "tragic forgotten places" among the people of Papua.
Poverty provokes dissatisfaction.
Lack of rice sold by Enarotal is too expensive for local people to buy.
Bread is just as unavailable.
People are growing their own food mainly with potatoes, in addition to a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Crop production is the work of women, each of whom can maintain four or five batadia fields.
They usually hold most of the harvest to the family, the rest sells on the local market.
Ten potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous peoples and new migrants who have come a long way since opening new routes to Nabire Airport.
These few jobs that exist are better for educated and wealthier migrants.
Raptors themselves often lack the capital or the necessary skills to compete for business.
"Young people are not interested in staying out because there are not jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Panay tribal council.
Separation keeps the eyes of the world away from Paapul.
In addition, there are severe restrictions on the foreign media.
At the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were sent out of Papua New Guinea, because they "did not follow the relevant practices", although they were given a rare film license.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Chief of Human Rights Watch's Asia Department, the Jokow Electoral Proclamations have not implemented the restrictions imposed on reports to promote transparency and development.
"The new threats to journalists trying to report Papua to the eastern troubled provinces of Papua and Papua New Guinea in Indonesia are rejection of the visa and the blacklist," he said in a statement.
The lack of a cyber-bullying journalism means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to neighboring Papua neighbors.
In March, the six Pacific States, Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands, spurred the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "various widespread crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Panies.
Historically, the needy countries have also supported the VPL.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Arrmanatha Nasir blamed the group's accusations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has a democratic regime and freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to blame evidence of human rights abuses."
Local people want more foreign governments to notice.
When Jayapurat visited the official delegation of Holland, headed by country's Ambassador for Human Rights, Kees Van Bar, on May 4, local people interrupted their silence in a meeting with an anonymous source, urging her, "We want freedom."
In Indonesia, new presidential elections take place in 2019, but the Shiites do not believe they will vote again for Jokow.
"Jokov is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of Pany," says Hobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants to convey to Jokow that, in addition to the fact that people in Panay constantly live under the threat of a rabid military, they are suffering from poor educational and health services in poverty.
According to Goba, people like Panius, like other peoples, will have to pay their voice to Jokow, which they have to pay.
"They do not need money, they want justice," he says.
In spite of threats and intimidation, the victims of the shooting victims, Panius, managed to cope with the last symbolic reprisal they buried in the opposing square of the victim's body of the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice can never be ruled out, at least they will not be responsible for forgetting their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus, with his head.
"What else can we do?"
The torch sank for the second time in the Dubai Torchi skyscraper
The light broke through Friday through one of the world's tallest residential dormitories in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to escape from this 337-meter-high and 79-story building.
This is another fire that has only devastated the high hole in just two years, called Torch or T√µrviktororn.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up on the fire gun and the shouting of people.
We were running down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down to the 50th floor, "said a resident of Reuters who called himself George.
According to the Dubai Civil Protection Officers, the firemen erased the flame at around 4am local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to protect the victims of shelter.
This incident can once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
According to the torch board's 2015 fire survey, it was found that the most damage was faced with fa√ßades - external decorative panels and insulation.
The British police have said they believe that the London Grenfell Tower insulation and facade panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the June fire that killed about 80 people.
Look: these phones will probably get sales in the fall
Spring and autumn are a great time for tech fans, because then the phone manufacturers will disclose their new top models.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came in sale, and in the fall, new hit-phones will be available on the stores.
According to Kristjan Seem, Marketing and Sales Director of Tele2, flagship design, flip chart scanner, edge-to-edge 4K resolution display and ultra-high speed processor featured this year's flagship.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the front of the Estonian smartphone sales network, has brought a lot of excitement.
Autumn will allow even more vibrant fast-loading, more durable batteries, better quality cameras and greater water and dust resistance for connoisseurs.
He added that based on the rumors, it is already possible to make assumptions and predict the four top models that are likely to conquer sales figures this year.
These four top-of-the-line top-of-the-line smartphones will go to the store this autumn this autumn.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach their stores in mid-September.
There are a lot of rumors about what the new Apple model looks like and what it can do.
If the iPhone 7 did not significantly increase the difference with the iPhone 6s, Apple's 10th birthday is expected to be completely different from the previous one.
There are four colors: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One element of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire front of the phone, the home button is lost, and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple's design manager JonyIve demands that the new iPhone model looks like a smooth glass.
This has also been the case with the iPhone's ceramic version.
In addition to the eyeglass scanner, wireless charging and even higher-quality camera, the faster A11 processor can be expected.
This is definitely the one of the most anticipated smartphones this year.
The pre-order of the new Galaxy Note 8 will begin on August 23rd.
There's been a lot of rumors about what new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It's said to be even more for business users, and S Pen offers even more functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wide angle and the other with a narrow-angle telephoto lens.
At the moment, nobody knows which two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test, which is definitely comparable to that of iPhone 8 with quality.
However, we are looking forward to August 23rd.
Although Nokia has brought three smartphones to the market this year with Nokia 6, there is still a lack of their flagship Nokia 8, which is already on display on August 16th.
We expect Nokialt to display a 5.3-inch edge-to-edge display and high-speed Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also an aluminum body and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like the Samsung, the new Nokia model has two rear cameras, optics manufactured by Zeiss.
With Sony's dedicated flagship to date with XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future there will be at least two smartphones with even more innovative features.
We look forward to a smartphone, which is somewhat more modest than the XZ Premium, but with the same or better camera.
Sony's new model has been speculated that its screen is at least sixth in size.
What the reality brings, we can see right now, since traditionally Sony has revealed its autumn flagship at the International Technology Week, IFA, which will take place from September 1-6.
According to leaked transcripts of telephone calls, Trump pressed for payment of a border wall for Mexico
The Washington Post disclosed transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and the Mexican and Australian leaders.
On January 27th, Trump spoke to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, calling on the latter to stop announcing that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president prayed for a public condemnation of the wall, saying, "You must not say that to the press."
Trump set his presidential campaign to promise to build along the south wall of the United States and swore to make Mexico pay for this project.
Transcripts of his first speech to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees to Australia would be "ridiculous," "silly" and "stupid." He argued that the agreement made during the Obama administration would leave him a "driver" impression because he has offered refugee relocation to the United States.
Shortly finished the call, telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant call of the day".
The Supreme Court did not discuss O√ú MRP Linna Liinid's complaint in a case where the city of Tartu rejected its tender for the procurement of bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a directive that rejected the offer of O√ú MRP Linna Liinid to Tartu bus, as the tender did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, the head of Tartu City Government Service.
This is the procurement of a public bus line service within the city of Tartu from 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP City Lines complained to the Supreme Court of the Tartu Circuit Court.
The Supreme Court did not handle this.
Although many complain in social media that the noise from the Weekend Festival disturbs their night and the whole city is full of drinkers, there are also many who have no bad sayings about the festival on the beach.
I am even amazed at the fact that the festivities were so polite in the shop!
I did not see any blurring or rudeness.
I even saw kindness, "says Laine, the lurking figure.
"It's great that people come in, bee and have fun with P√§rnu, which is asleep in the winter," he adds cheerfully.
The waves do not disturb the beach from the tufts.
While living in the center he still heard that playing music on the beach, now the music has not yet reached his home wall.
"But I hope I hear," he says cheerfully.
Also, Agnes, who spoke to √ïhtulehe, says that the big festival is rather good for P√§rnu - it will greatly contribute to the sales of local merchants.
In addition, he is pleased that so many outskirts have come to visit the capital of the summer.
The ladies do not mess with the woman.
Even though I'm not sunbathing at the beach, but it's nice that the beach has come to life.
And it's nice that the people are moving, and this has already been three times already, "says the woman.
It was a bit worse for the first time.
"There may have been complaints," he ponders.
However, the lie on the beach is commonplace for the summer peasants, according to her.
"This weekend is a very good promo for our small city," says Harri, who sits in the park.
Melo and M√∂ll have not struck him in the vibration of his life.
But what about it ?!
We should keep everything together.
Think about how this intercultural communication would be better.
The loud music of the man does not catch up.
It does not interrupt, even though I live near the place.
"Good people are able to save and there is no mistake," he says.
According to him, the guests who came to P√§rnu are polite.
"Of course, they are too exaggerated with bottles, but young people are young and God is goddamned, let's go, but be human and we can handle it!" He says.
Coastal residents have traveled somewhere away, whether they are relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival is positively influenced by life - people like this lie," says Tiina, who was walking around with children in P√§rnu.
His family and festival music are not disturbed, even though last year it even went further than this year.
Last summer, the stage was the other way around, then we heard more.
We live outside ourselves out of the city, which actually sounds far enough along P√§rnu River, "he says.
Pearson will cut another 3000 jobs and reduce dividends to revive the business
British education firm Pearson said on Friday that it will cut another 3,000 jobs and reduce its interim dividend by 72 percent, triggering another restructured program to tackle the impending shortage.
The lost jobs, which, according to CEO John Fallon, are highly likely at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will add 4,000 jobs lost during the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced plans to cut costs by another ¬£ 300 million (US $ 394 million) under the third cost reduction program to try and revitalize a business that has been hit by a swift transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House last month to its Bertelsmann affiliate, said their expectations for the year remained unchanged after a one-percent increase in sales revenue of 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.

Convict attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
According to officials, the suicide bomber attacked the military capitals in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
NATO's statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local allegations, three civilians were killed in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the latest incident of violence that hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people died in a Herat mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, two people near the embassy in Iraq killed a suicide bomber in Kabul.
The NATO statement said Thursday's explosion occurred when a joint patrol of the Afghan army was attacked "a man-made self-made explosive".
According to the statement, everyone is injured in a stable condition and is being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to correspondents, the growing power of the Taliban and the group, known as the Islamic State (ISIS), is a source of serious concern for the forces in Bagram, Qarabagh.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, at least 1662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan, about 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people in Shi'ites.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, a major bomb attack in the center killed more than 150 people - this has been the worst death in the country since the US-led forces overthrew the Taliban in 2001.
This violence emphasizes the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops contributing to the military and the police.
According to correspondents, suicide attacks in Kabul over the past few weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis in the government, its policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA canceled the decision to postpone the fine after the actions
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has lifted the decision to delay the introduction of a Obama regulation imposing an obligation on states to limit emissions of smog, one day after the 15 states complained to the court due to the move by the agency.
EPA announced its decision to continue with the 2015 ozone depletion activities on Wednesday, saying it reflects the agency's commitment to cooperating with states.
"We believe we need to engage with and dialogue with our partner states," said Scott Pruit, head of the EPA, in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June EPA's intention to postpone the ozone-depleting estimates, which measure the pollution of different parts of the country in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 for a stricter air quality standard.
The 15 mainly democratic states jointly filed a lawsuit with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, saying that the decision is illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has been trying to pull back several environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama. In short, this is part of a broader plan for economic growth.
But these attempts have triggered retaliatory reactions among Democrats and Nature Conservatives, who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhaling airborne ozone "can reduce lung function and increase the risk of developing respiratory disease," for example asthma.
German pigs may have a party.
German pigs and cattle may have a party because of heavy rains threatening the second largest European Union producer of wheat, writes Bloomberg.
This year, this may mean that weeks of lunch before harvesting may mean that the bread intended for the bread industry is only suitable for bait to animals.
"The quality of wheat is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said analyst Bernhard Chilla of Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can be used for animal feed, which is twice as much as normal, Agra predicted.
German farmers, as well as their European colleagues, have come across all kinds of weather this year.
First of all winter was too dry.
Then came a cold spring, which replaced the heat wave in June.
In July, Germany hit the sands, which continued in August.
Many eyes are turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five percent of wheat has been harvested.
The majority of the region has not yet started harvesting, local purchaser Ceravis announced.
"There are quite sophisticated days," said Ceravise Senior Factor Frank Deckert of Rendsburg.
Consistency in all things, or the Finns' interior decoration
The beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of trade fairs, because the large windows offer unsurpassed views of the Saimaa Peninsula in many (living) rooms.
At every turn, our Nordic neighbors are trying to create both high-quality and energy-efficient homes.
Admiration and adherence also deserve Finnish woodworking skills in building and finishing materials, furniture and beauty products.
Extreme techniques and clever solutions can be found in the showrooms by both the builder and the (home) designer.
It must be clearly prominent that black, white and gray shaded communities, when supplemented by woody tuna and garden plants, can be very entertaining.
Good ideas can be picked up for a week, because the show will last until August 13.
Accessories and herb packs suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
At night, today, Weekend Festival Balticule was drawn to this day, and Martin Garrix gave everything to keep her on the list as the last speaker.
The people were really turning around during the performance of Garrix - they sang, danced, danced with self-explanation.
When Garrix finished, it was spread as a common mass on the beach from P√§rnu.
We bring you a gallery with all the pictures our photographer has been trying for the weekend for three days.
Certainly you are in some of them, look yourself up!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to go face-to-face in the most attractive boxing suit of up to 66.7 kg in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN office in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the incredible World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked the other end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenkot, World Boxing Organization Closing Championship.
After Garcia's unanimous decision to win the former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday in Showtime, both fighters belong to the lead figure of the weight chart.
Garcia reached out on her right arm and said, "How are you doing, Champion?"
I wish you success. "
Lomachenko defends his belly with Miguel Marria on Saturday evening at ESPN 19.
When a few pose for the photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas said that a possible match between the fighters would be "perfect measurements".
"I am a former limb," reminded Garcia.
"I got to Broner up to 63.5 kg, but I'm not that big.
I'm small at 63.5 kg.
I want to move down the light weight.
And it must move upwards to light weight [61.2 kg], and then we can fight.
Fans have liked it.
Let us give them that. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"The world of boxing needs this fight."
Klima raised the question of whether it should be paid for. This is part of his strategy of letting Lomachenkol debut at 61.2 kg in the classroom this year to make an appointment with Garcia (37-0, 30 slaughterings) next summer, who is also interested in fighting Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbell's winner after their lightweight title race on September 23rd.
"Fighting this fight could be rewarding because fans have been opposed to it," said Garcia, later saying he was open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We are the key players.
No other name can attract so much attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said she considers Lomachenkot "a mighty fighter" and may go to see her Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia, saying that she thought she saw the three division's Riverside champions out of "very slow, excuse me, Mikey ... you wanted to kill him."
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the impact strength and then to wrestle.
Both confirmed that they felt how tense their pursuit of power would grow.
"This is a fight that is awaiting realization.
No other confrontation creates so much attention and buzz.
I'm more than willing to work on this, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I have been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is just that.
It will be a good fight. "
Which worlds are you moving to Estonia?
Last year, police and border guard (PPA) issued a record-breaking record of more than 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have mostly traveled to Estonia to work, study or have a family.
For example, when it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit for 6702 foreigners last year, the number was 4928.
The authorities do not know how many migrants will eventually stay in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared at the Ministry of the Interior.
When ten years ago, nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia, in 2000, the number of people in 2000 has already begun to reach.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased sharply during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014, 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, 675 people a year earlier.
According to the data of the Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is the highest in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived last year more than left.
"The Ukrainian community has always been great in Estonia, and because of the difficult circumstances, it is natural for the country to find work and study opportunities in a country where the community and many of the family are already in front," said the spokeswoman for the Ministry of the Interior, Kristin Rammus.
Last year, the number of Ukrainians with a temporary residence permit was even higher than even the number of Russian citizens, although in the last ten years the highest number of temporary residence permits has been issued to the latter.
If the Ukrainians come here predominantly to work, then Russian citizens for the sake of family migration.
"Given the historical Russian community here, they are more likely to have the largest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, a migration scientist at the Public Health Academy.
"If you look at where the citizens of Russia who have obtained residence permits in Estonia have moved, then Ida-Viru County is coming to Harjumaa immediately," he added, and pointed out that about 40 percent of them married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens were granted a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wished to renew their residence permit decreased.
"The jump is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for permanently to settle in Estonia," explained the spokeswoman for the Ministry of the Interior Rammus, who said that Russian citizens' interest in Estonian residence permits has remained stable for many years.
For a new residence permit to permanently resettle to Estonia, foreigners who have resided for at least three years can apply for the previous year.
Its purpose is to encourage the admission of people to leave.
However, a residence permit for a long-term resident requires, for example, five years.
Due to the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit has also probably decreased.
For example, last year, such a residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians can change their work, and the state of Estonia will no longer be a step forward if the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit was popularly popular - the owners of the gray passport (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36) last year became applicants.
A total of 1968 people were living in Estonia for the purpose of settling for their residence, among them, for example, 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants has already reached 1269.
Over a decade, surprisingly, Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for residence permits in Estonia.
In 2007, three residence permits were issued to the Nigerians, then 200 years later.
From Nigeria come to study in these universities.
Still, Estonian universities are popular, for example, among the Georgians, the Chinese and the Turks.
The number of people from India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen predominantly due to study migration.
Also, they are subject to the rule that where a community has been formed, it will be easier for others to get there, "added Rammus.
In ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, the same number from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6000 third-country nationals per year receive residence permits, this is about 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even considering citizens of the European Union, migration is about a percentage, Maasing commented that the figures are actually small.
According to the data of the Statistical Office, 14 822 people were living in Estonia last year, 13 792 from this.
This means that immigration has exceeded the emigration for the second year.
Most of the outsiders and fugitives are Estonian citizens, but more are those who leave.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was minus last year with 2000 people.
Estonians migrate primarily between Finland and Estonia.
Mom's Couture's princess smash with satsie, embroidery and tulle
However, the tiniest idea lady has a history of Maria Tammeor - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream about somewhere in the museum sometime and admire ancient cloths and sleeves.
If you do something with passion, then you will study and learn about it every day.
This is a discovery pleasure!
The glamorous world of Mommu Couture can seem somewhat unlucky, but the designer does not think so.
You decide how much shine your life is!
I have a girlfriend who has a healthy sauna full of haute couture dresses I created.
Because it's not his fault that he does not live in Hollywood and does not go on a red carpet every day, he also wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and bears!
You can live your own life special!
The fashion designer does not recognize the split between brilliant events and a gray daily life.
It was this thought that laid the groundwork for bringing the high school to the countryside in Estonia, between the forests and fields, people who often do not get the mood.
For example, in V√µru, J√µhvi and P√§rnu fashion cell, mum collection was presented, where a 45-model royal defile filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, they often take a pose, dance with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - they call a brave bracelet, they stand up, they want to thank you handwritingly.
A large part of the audience had to be honored, but now they are Mammu Couture fans.
If you overcome the expectations of people, they are appalled!
And I like the feeling that I'm in my fashion model as if on a summer tour.
In P√§rnu, we had a 50-meter-long red carpet, beautiful streets full of streets, it seemed that they would not come to an end!
Maria also does not admire the imagination that the superstar supermodel must present the work, she is happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
Often, I call my customers on stage - they've always been happy.
This is a ghastly experience, you can shine on a stage in a gorgeous dress!
I'm so sorry that I have never seen my performance, I always stand behind the stage to give the hopeless perfectionist the last dirt on things.
My nerves would not allow me to look calmly from the hall.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who does not only want to play a role of representation, but to be in every way.
I have a sewing machine in my studio, I carry out most of my collections.
I like the whole process where you play with details you discover.
I'm never far from my work and I'm not afraid of work.
Design is not only limited to stylistics, logistics, organization, organization - everything needs to fit into the days of a temperamental woman.
These hours of work are still enormous in fanatics.
I can not tell when my day ends, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an unbeatable luck: I'm doing something beautiful, a person can be something beautiful and, in turn, compliments.
Many times it has been said that my dresses are magic - they make themselves feel princess.
Mummy Couture has remained the signature of the whimsical series that made Maria talent famous overnight.
Martin M√º√ºrsepp from U18 boys: The Estonians' subgroup gun was now turned against us
Sorry, the fairy tale was running out.
The first thing to notice was that we did not get to our desk.
And if there's such a big difference in the table, nothing is to be done, "commented Martin Uisrepp, assistant coach of BC Kalev / Cramo, on the loss to Estonia of U18 basketball shoes 61:75 to our UK's only basketball player.
The opponents took 28 balls out of the attack and received so many more attacks.
We were not ready for their aggressive defense or attack, it did.
Many angelic attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build a defense.
However, they managed to keep their hands everywhere, but we could not combine them.
It kicked the team down.
The opposing homework was better done.
According to M√§nsepp, Estonia should have done more tactical mistakes to thwart the opponents.
In the last quarter - we had a zero mistake, but the opponents already received several quick cash.
Attempts and intense assimilation, which was our weapon in the subgroup tournament, now turned against all of us.
Today, we had no strength against their aggressiveness.
The mason was restored to his house in Kalev, Matthias Tass.
In general, the tournament can say good words about the whole team, to date there has been a single hit.
Unfortunately, the bellies of this aggressive opponent have already been met.
The cup has always been confident and has played out today, but it seemed that he was tired - he has suffered a pretty big burden.
But he did some pretty good moves that I've seen before in training, "added the tutor.
Horrendous numbers: in a basketball team of girls, the EM-Tournament dropped by three quarters to less than 10 points ...
In the U18 age class, only the EM B-Division Basketball Tournament in Tallinn, the young men started in Dublin, do not attend.
And the Estonian game with Poland, unfortunately, is an ancestor field.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter it was 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took the foot from the accelerator, and that time was 16:16.
In the first and second quarters of Estonia, 4 were cast, the third was 1 point ...
At the same time, the Estonians first hit two pieces of the first four whistles in the first two minutes, and then passed the game 25 pieces, then one in three and then another 21 beats ...
For almost half an hour, 47 whiskers were caught one.
In addition, 2 points out of 4 free hands.
There were a reasonable number of bumps in that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had the highest score of 33 and Estonia 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, on the day off had to admit Portugal's 83:56 advantage.
NATO vessels came to stock upgrades to Tallinn
Today, the 1st NATO Standing Missile Defense Control Group arrived on a weekly tour to Tallinn for a scheduled port visit to supplement ships' supplies and prepare for upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships will make preparations for the return to the sea and provide crew members with the opportunity to have a couple of days rest.
After the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters in order to carry out a number of exercises and be prepared for future historical exploration operations.
"Participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and their joint training in local waters is well illustrating our integration with Allied forces," said Arto Reinmaa, commander of the Operations and Planning Division at the command of the Navy's fleet commander.
From June 29th, NATO's first permanent missile defense group, Gvido Laudups, Lieutenant Commander of the Latvian Navy, will head the Lieutenant Commander of the Latvian Marine Corps, who at the ceremony held in Riga, the task of the group leader from the Estonian Navy Commander Lieutenant Commander Johan-Elias from Seljamaa.
The flagship of the group is the Latvian Navy support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, which also operates as the leader of the group.
In this half-year, the international unit also includes the Estonian Naval Mining Officer Sakala.
One of the four naval submarines under NATO naval command is NATO's 1st Standing Missile Defender Group, which is one of the first ready-to-deployed early response teams that the Alliance can send to different parts of the world within five days.
From 4th to 13th August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita Monastery will once again be the place where the Birgitta Festival, celebrated 13 years ago by maestro Eri Klas, is being held.
This year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unparalleled, according to the artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonicist Risto Joost (36).
Risto Joost: The opera world classics include Traviata and Tosca, ballet performances from the enchanting "Boleros" amusing "Karlsson", as well as self-production, which includes the production of Joseph Haydn's oratorio "Seasons" by the same international crew, who in 2015 brought "Creation" to Haydn's second masterpiece on Pirita stage.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatrical productions.
It's bigger than any musical theater in its usual form.
It's a festival with a charm of power and never let go of it anymore.
For the experience that the listener receives in this enormous and mysterious environment makes the human soul ring and touches human beings in a way that can not be described.
Risto, you are the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first time.
Did the maestro Eri Klas's shoes look a bit big?
Of course, since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it has been a lot of help.
He directed me through my entire student career and also supported the beginning of a career in conducting.
Maybe that's why it's easier for me to continue my work.
Eri Klas has inflicted so much kindness on the Birgitta Festival team and, naturally, it all goes over to me.
It was great to join a team who knows exactly how things are going.
The great heart of Eri Klas also gave me strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in the Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am now and I can handle it!
What could excite the audience at the festival this year, what special offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, surprise, the presentation is supposed to be the first ballet written for Astrid Lindgren's story.
For this, "Karlsson is flying".
And one notable nuance is that the ballet is composed by the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons who himself expressed his desire to write this work.
Obviously, Karlson's character has already lived in the soul as a child.
Risto, how are you doing all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner for sure.
This kind of work requires a support system and lots of love, and I am fortunate to have a lot of it.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions are not as dependent on other people as me, so how can I go against each new day.
And keeping such an awareness of tone, maintaining a positive and, in fact, smiling to myself in the morning mirror, greatly increased my luck.
Especially this week, when the most important samples are taken, I have practiced this very aggressively and it works.
Smiling for yourself will activate the brain and lift the tone.
It's not just a word of mouth.
I think people still do not know half the things of their body, which the universe offers them, but everyone will discover it gradually.
Immediately, an instant moment is right now.
Do you have any rituals before taking the conductor's assault?
Still, clothes have to be replaced for more comfortable.
This is a little moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I do not have the opportunity to rest before spending a big break or to have a little nap.
In fact, I even like to actively interact with people, even before the conductor's party.
But come to Birgitta Festival, here's what to discover for a not-so-great opera and ballet friend!
Watch an entertaining video with Risto Joost!
The results of the Swedish aging test applicants' aging tests were published
In Sweden, a test was carried out among asylum seekers, assessing their age with a novel approach to medicine. The latest test results show that more than 80 percent of the tests were rated older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Science (R√§ttsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to more accurately assess the age when applying for asylum after the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to correctly determine the age of many allegedly minor refugees.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases for testing, and the Institute of the Institute of Public Health has delivered a total of 2481 tests between mid-March 2017 and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) was judged to be 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the CHA estimated that the test "may be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases it was concluded that a person is "probably younger than 18".
The tests are only used if the age of the person is in question.
According to Johan G√∂ransson, a member of the Institute of Judicial Medicine, the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
"We do not see a big difference compared to the previous months statistics, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The fact that most of the cases were judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been lying about their age.
The institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and said that in 442 cases, "there are indications that the person being examined is 18 years of age or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of their 581 test, it turned out that in 243 cases, a person had directly stated that he would be 18 this year.
This method of medical evaluation of the age at which wisdomineal X-rays and knee-joint MRTs are performed, after which they are allowed to be examined by dentists and radiologists, have been criticized in some districts.
One of the skeptics is the Endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, Claude Marcus, whose duties include assessing the biological maturity of humans to determine whether they had undergone puberty before or sooner.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the current measurement method should be used.
The determination of the biological age in this way is very precarious.
If we can not say with certainty, then we should not face that we can, "he told the newspaper Metro.
But Johan G√∂ransson from the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "Generally, it is possible to say that the risk of inaccurate adult admittance is low.
The highest, or about 10%, is the risk if the person is a bit below 18. "

Anna Maria Orel, 20 year old, made a beautiful debut at the London Olympics, earning a good place at the 67.37s.
Orl was the youngest female freaks in MM, and a cheerful woman confirmed she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and got a good experience.
With the first attempt (64.80) I made my average score right away, the second (62.80) risked too much and the third (67.37) managed to keep it clear, "said Orel after the race.
I was looking for my emissions and I am very glad that I found it.
Anna Maria Oreli MM's debut ended in a good 18th place.
Rain did not break Orel, because he trained him to winter through the TUT stadium.
"I'm hardened," he said with a little smile.
At the London Olympics, almost all the houses in the neighborhood were crowded, did Orel perceive people around them, or was able to turn them off?
I thought, but in a positive way.
Everyone says that it gives - that's it!
If you compete yourself, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will stay in peace with the debut of the MM, and he still has a lot of good competitions: "I came here this season 32, or the last result, I finished 18th place.
This is a very decent result.
I am 20 years old and MM is the only one that reads.
I have a good experience and in some days I want to compete in the name of medals.
Governor of West Virginia announced a change of party
Governor of West Virginia, Governor Jim Justice, announced on Thursday night, with President Trump, that he would replace the parties.
"Like it or not, Democrats walked from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today, I say to you, having prayed and prayed abundantly ... today I tell you, in the western provinces, that I can not help you as a democratic governor any longer."
At the gathering, the joyous festivities were triggered.
"So, tomorrow, I will be a Republican," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you that it's time to play another game."
Trump had promised a major announcement earlier in the West Virginia gathering.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and the coal business is actually from his father.
Its value is about $ 1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement on Thursday night announcing that "Governor Justice is another blow to the democratic party, which would rather prevent a country from becoming better again than working for it".
"Of all the 15 governorates and the control of the fewest states in history, Governor Justice is just the most recent denial for the party that is completely out of the box and can not find a positive and connecting message," said RNC chief Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News.

Coe praised the Russians for an honest apology for the doping test
The international ninum of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised Russia for a doping test on Thursday's Thursday, but reiterated that now is not the time to reinstate sports.
Nominated by Russia's athletics, Dmitry Shylakhtin, at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championship, said that his country's backtrack is right and has a clear goal to fight against doping.
He apologized for "all athletes who have been crocheted gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to put an end to the ban on banning in November 2015, after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"In my opinion, today it was a very honest answer, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole council and the whole congress were pleased that the Russian alliance itself acknowledged that they had quite difficult times and they were doing everything possible to restructure the alliance."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for reinstatement.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but the Congress supports the working group's suggestion that now is not the right time to withdraw Russia," said Coe.
"We have to make every effort in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want pure athletes to be separated from the corrupted system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the IAAF's stringent criteria will compete at neutral Athletes World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF working group, said on Monday that Russia has not yet met several criteria for resettlement.
Following a report from the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that doping controls are still inadequate and that traffickers who are banning are still free to do so.
The revolution in electric vehicles will greatly alter the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
The fact that the electric vehicle revolution significantly transforms everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure will also create new winners and losers on the metal market.
Although mining giants such as Glencore can say that they win and lose from one place, smaller miners will not help.
Glencore is currently serving coal and oil, but in the era of electric cars, cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel demand grow.
This year, the UK, French and Norwegian governments have taken a decisive step forward in the spread of electric cars, which will allow the sale of new cars that use fossil fuels to be banned in the next few years.
That's why Volvo has already announced that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine and that Tesla will bring a cheaper Model 3 electric car to the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that electric cars will be sold over two decades more than cars using petroleum fuels.
"With regard to some metals, this will change everything," said Capital Economics raw material analyst Simona Gambranini to Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has grown over the years.
Electric vehicles have about three times more copper than a conventional car, Glencore reported.
More copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that by 2025 demand for copper will increase by about five percent.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore receives a boost from the rising trend of electric cars and the fact that it is the world's largest cobalt producer, Jefferies Group predicted.
According to the brokerage firm, the winners of other winners of electric cars are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is responding to the changing trend.
Cobalt has risen 70 percent on the London Metal Exchange this year.
Last year's price increase was 37 percent.
Copper has also risen by 14 percent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's stock rose 20 percent in London, rising to the rivals of the Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo Americas.
On the losers side, there are lead companies like Recyclex and Campine who have to adapt to a new era.
The main end uses of lead are gasoline and diesel-powered car starter batteries.
Electric cars use lithium ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to the demand for electricity unless it is used for other purposes to overcome the decline in demand," said Michael Widmer, Market Research Manager at Merrill Lynch, Bank of America.
In the form of a price movement, the lead is not yet noticeable in the midst of a trend.
Lead has risen by 17 percent this year, the highest metal price in the world for major industrial metals in London.
Investors will see problems with the metal in the distant future.
"I'm not sure that lead is so bad because cheap petroleum keeps cars in competition," said Herwig Schmidt, Sales Manager at Triland Metals, a metal trading company.
When lead demand falls, it will slowly take place.
It may happen in about ten years.
For the time being, however, tougher exhaust emission standards mean that hybrid car demand is increasing, which depends on the frequent start-up of engines with advanced lead-based batteries, is estimated by the international lead and zinc research organization.
Light metals, such as aluminum, replace the steel, as a lighter car can travel with less electricity.
This explains already from 2013 to 2016 an additional 1.6 million tons of aluminum demand.
It accounts for 2.7 percent of aluminum in world total production.
This trend is likely to worsen, Widmer said.
Aluminum has risen by 13 percent this year, as the growing demand by car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers do not sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of SMC trucks.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a light alloy of steel to withstand aluminum.
"Superficial steel should be a response to this development," said Exana BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of the oil season can also lead to suffering from platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal diesel engine was used as car catalysts, according to metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"Many of today's high-demand raw materials like oil and platinum may not be in high demand in the future," said Nathis's raw material analyst Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that the raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance changes over the next 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, head of Uncore, said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold from full electric vehicles.
The great hope of platinum manufacturers in the 10-year perspective is based on the hydrogen engine developed by Toyota Motors and Hyundai Motors, which depend on platinum to produce hydrogen from electricity.
So far, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser to electric cars," said Exane BNP Paribas Brunet.
In Germany, German car manufacturers came to a big rebound in July, as the Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in the Mercedes-Benz and Porsche hometown.
How football fiscal rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unrestrained spending of European football clubs will not prevent the transition from the Spanish football club to the Paris-Saint Germain Barcelona Club in France.
Any consequences for UEFA, the governing body that dominates the European game and the ability to ban teams from participating in a prestigious Champions League tournament, are still waiting for Paris Saint-Germain.
The Fair Play Financial Rules (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at some time prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid ‚Ç¨ 222 million ($ 262 million) solely for the Brazilian to buy out of its contract, and Neymar's salary will start to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of going to the French club of Neymar.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to withdraw money to recruit Neymar and add to their long-running rivalry, given that the team is funded by the ruling family in Qatar's energy franchise.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that will allow them to get out of their soccer field.
FFP laid the foundations for Michel Platini after she was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that succeed in looking at large debts are actually cheating and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners were to abandon support.
Since 2011, FFP focuses on tracking their losses instead of club debt.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a potential club and then spend a lot of money on making the team better and creating a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
Clubs may incur losses of up to EUR 30 million for FFP's current three-year assessment period, which runs until 2018.
And despite the fact that Platini was disgraced by the Presidency in 2015, his successor, UEFA Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"FFP is definitely not dead, and we will undoubtedly continue to further strengthen these rules," said last week to The Associated Press Andrea Traverso, who is supervisor of UEFA's FFP.
Although PSG paid a single premium for the Neymar overpayment clause, they can distribute this amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so it's possible to show a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG received the hardest penalties for Manchester City, which belongs to Abu Dhabi.
The PSG was fined 60 million euro (at that time, 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and the club was required to restrict the Champions League team to 21 players instead of the usual 25 for the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to outsmart regulators, blow up their earnings through club-owned companies.
Qatar's company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of sponsorship is considered to be higher than standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority PSG grant was bloated.
It has been said that a certain part of the Neymar PSG service may come from Qatar from the 2022 World Cup Compromise Management Committee.
However, PSG and Qatar in 2022 deny that Neymar could become a World Champion and claim that UEFA's regulatory agencies could easily reveal this maneuver.
Penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant about any attempts to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not proactively discussed the transfer of Neymar to PSG.
They talked to The Associated Press, provided that they are anonymous because they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
Recent reports show that PSG earned more than EUR 10 million in sales in the 2015-2016 season with sales of around EUR 542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year has not yet been published.
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neymar will be good for sponsorship transactions, trade and shoe sales.
The club expects to increase the turnover by at least 30% in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
Spain too, being clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to prevent the transfer of Neymar, arguing that PSG would violate the FFP.
"This is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said Javier Tebas, president of La Liga, to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG belongs mainly to Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is a member of the American sports academy, shares La Liga's attitude that the state is financing the club.
"It's the result of property rights and it has completely changed the entire football field in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, because there may be other ways or other interests of the state to represent such a large player in the country. "
The Norwegian Low Cost Norwegian has a nice tradition to put their pictures on the flying stick, who have shifted their boundaries and inspired others, writes trip.ee.
Together with the expansion of Norwegian geography, the circle of people who have earned a place on the fly is also expanding.
Among the selected people are, for example, Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (pictured) and Miguel de Cervantes.
In the near future, however, one plane will be decorated with a portrait of Queen's legendary singer, Freddie Mercury.
Today 50 years ago: a hurricane storm in Estonia, which teased houses and roofs and windows.
The storm of the century, the hurricane that rocked on August 6 and 7, caused major damage to L√§√§nemaa, Harjumaa and Rapla County.
During these days, Northwest Estonia had a wind speed of over 30 m / s.
My old man ran in the garden from one tree to another and tried to support them with their hands.
Everything was dark and ragged, like the end of the world.
In the meantime, the roofs of the houses were already flying, reminded in 2002 of the story of Linda Kurova Haapsalu to the magazine Eesti Loodus.
Linda's husband saw how the garden he planted collapsed.
But what do you support the trees with your hands, where do you get such a storm?
The sea came under the window, water was flooded with windows, "said Mrs. Linda, who lived in Kalda Street in Haapsalu.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station pier was 20-30 meters away, Linda saw most of the Haapsalu people just like the next morning.
According to local sources, the trees in Paralepa were behind the trees, some completely lying, some half.
Everyone looked very frustrating, the storm ran out of beautiful old trees calling and cracking like a war.
L√§√§ne-Virumaa did not suffer severely in August 1967 compared to West Estonia, but losses were high there, Virumaa Teataja wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were swept from the ground, but the parks of our lake also suffered greatly.
In Tallinn, the wind speed was measured up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
On the evening of August 6, a little tattooed cloakroom was shouting at the Meriv√§lja in Tallinn: "Mother, mother!
The chickens are in the air and can not be down! ", Wrote the Virumaa Teataja.
The P√µlli manor house in Viljandi County was destroyed during the storm to the point where it was decided to demolish later.
T√µri ski resorts were not touched upon Augusti Storm, which were later restored.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star issued a newspaper that the harvesting of cities and settlements from fallen trees and their branches was slowly moving, and the inhabitants would be able to capture the harvest.
Cornfields suffered greatly in Tormis, and the newspaper reported that "party organizations must be encouragers and directors in both tidying up and harvesting."
Horses can be talked about if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m / s.
The wind record in Estonia lasts from November 2, 1969, when Ruhnu was measured at a speed of 48 m / s.
On the island of Vaindloo, the instrument fell apart, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean beaches: nightly christening and the poor coastal world
Cold summer nights also mean a lesser harvest in Tallinn's beaches.
"If there is no, then there are people on the beach, and if not, then there are no people," says the beach cleaner.
Streets on the north-eastern shore of Stroomi cayers.
They are offered a melodic competition at low speeds, an electric tractor that slips down on the track.
In fact, the last sifted seven centimeters from the sand, picking up the seaweed and the debris left by people: bottle caps, cigarette tapes and more.
People are still on the beach, regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If there are beautiful weather then there are people on the beach, and if not, then there are no people ", says Aleksandr Usov, Head of the Harvesting of the private beach Haabersti Haldus.
The clock is 6.30 and there is a bitter harvest on the beach, because the clock at eight should be wide enough for humans.
Usov has been at work since four o'clock.
Besides Stroomi, he keeps his eyes on the beach of Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakum√§e and Paljasaar Pikakari.
The quantities of garbage have decreased.
Many years ago it was much more.
People are now able to evaluate what is being done for them, "says Usov, who has been cleaning up the beach for 15 years.
Before, it was as if something new was upright, it was already broken the next day.
Now what is on the beach is being kept.
Clean beach price
One of the largest works on Estonian beaches is the shore-cleared sea garbage or adru.
For example, in the Pirita beach, it is necessary to transport 400,000 tons this beach season.
"This is an incredible amount," says Usov.
The second big category is the household waste, all that people leave behind.
The Stumbes Beachfront, half a mile, has eight large containers that need to be drained three times a week.
So much rubbish gets.
However, the colder summer months have meant that the rubbish is a fifth less than otherwise.
The third species are abandoned things.
Most often these are babies.
This time, Usov has shoved ten dozen cars out of the sand.
They are left to wait for the wooden road leading to the beach.
"Usually they get out more, but this is a normal catch." Usov already knows that he will soon find them again from the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to dip them again into the sand.
The garbage is scattered
Erika Scholler, a Haabersti administrative service representative, admits that tractor screening practices are disturbing locals.
The noise, which runs from early hours to midnight, disturbs people in the neighborhood.
However, this work is impossible on a day-by-day basis.
In one month the beach must be screened twice.
"If we do not, then the district will penalize us," Scholler points out.
But, like Pirita, Pikakari and P√§rnu, the goal is to get the Stroomi beach under the international blue flag label.
"Compared to Europe, much more work is done in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are maintained," says Scholler.
We have more plow and stones and more difficult to screen sand.
However, there is less waste on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
When he heard that the beach was being talked about, the Martin living close to the Stroomi stretches across the journalists 'and cleaners' discussions, highlighting the current bottlenecks in the beach.
In the mornings there is a picture of everywhere.
The problem is with the birds and bottle carriers who have gripped the garbage bags with ease, "Martin says.
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behavioral patterns, Martin hopes that the municipality will take something with bins and put them, for example, on the covers, to prevent, at least, the birds in the rummage.
In general, Martin is still pleased with the development of Stroomi.
It can be seen that the city takes care of it.
It has become more pleasant with children's playgrounds, lighted and freshly paved roads.
It was once that roller skates could only ride on one path, "notes Martin.
The findings of a barley cake in Stroomis: coins, only coins
The 40-year-old Dimitri, who combed the coastline with a metal detector as a cocktail of fire, has come to use the morning tide.
He does not believe that today or in the future will find anything precious.
The seabirds are not sufficiently generous enough.
"I have been engaged in this year and have not found anything valuable until now," Dmitry says.
As a hobbyist, there are some euro coins, bottlenecks and also dangerous nails in Dmitri's diary, which will be thrown at a trash can.
Usually there are still coins.
"Gold, rings, and the like are usually not there," says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to receive interest rates at an earlier level, as impoverished economic growth and the weakening of inflation have softened speculation over the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth remains sluggish, as households' tightening incomes have put interest rates on hold.
Policy makers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6% to hold the rates at 0.25%, and fewer members will demand this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank downgraded its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7%, and its 2018 inflation rate of 1.6%, and warned that household income pressures remain, as inflation is expected to remain close to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank also signaled that the growth in rates would be necessary in the next couple of years to curb inflation as a result of Brexit, and financial markets may require higher borrowing costs than expected.
Members also voted in favor of a partial withdrawal of the mammoth package that has hit the economy in Brecket a year ago.
The bank finishes in February with a timely funding scheme offering low-cost financing to banks, although it said it would expect a GBP 15 billion pledge of GBP 115 billion under this scheme.
In the minutes of the decision on the decision, the bank says: "In the mid-year forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain intact in the near future, as the difficult household income situation will continue to have an impact on consumption."
The rates were reiterated in order to "mitigate inflation" by "tightening monetary policy" and "somewhat larger" than expected markets.
The stock exchange is currently predicting a first rise in the third quarter of next year and a second rise in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that all kinds of jumps are gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth assumptions for this and next year are comparable to the May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The 1.8% growth forecast for 2018 remained unchanged.
After this news, the pound depreciated against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell to 0.5% to $ 1.31 and to 0.4% to ‚Ç¨ 1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators, which has suppressed rising expectations due to the rise in GDP in the second quarter increased by 0,2% from the previous three months.
The bank says growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will begin to gather momentum.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little reason for reaping rising inflation and worsening wage rises to households suffering from suffering, saying that the situation is still a bit worse before the recovery.
It was added that monetary policy can not be offset by income streams over the next couple of years, but a significant recovery in wages is anticipated towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak pound, the economy also boosts the growing demand for British output, which partly compensates for lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after rates were passed in August last year at 0.25% after the shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden weakening of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully inflate prices and economy.
Before the last decision of the bank, there was a growing demand for rising rates, as inflation had increased pressure on hard-to-hit households; in July, three policymakers demanded an increase of 0.5%.
Last month, inflation dropped to 2.6%, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was anticipated, and in the coming months it will face a rise again.
The bank said that the excess increase compared to the 2% target was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Coreco's mortgage brokerage director, said: "Given the recent fall in exchange rates, the mortgage market is once again becoming more competitive as lenders are eager to work and hope to end the year positively.
The exchange seems particularly favorable to those whose current deals are about to come to a halt as refinancing, often at no service and low rates, has become increasingly popular. "
The NHS has been writing controversial HIV drugs for 10,000 people
Since September, patients have been given access to "transformative" HIV for preventative treatment after a trial at the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should finance the drug.
NHS England has announced that national healthcare will now make an estimated Pre-Exacal Prophylaxis (PrEP) of up to an average of approximately 86% in high-risk individuals during the initial three-year clinical trial, estimated at 10,000.
The NHS agreed to fund a clinical trial after the Court of Appeals upheld the decision of the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS is able to pay PrEP, despite its own claims that the drug should be financed by local governments instead.
Simon Stevens, NHS Chief Executive Officer, Edinburgh, welcomed the announcement on Thursday as "a new broad intervention," while the National Aid Fund (NAT) described it as "a turning point".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October, more clinics will be added before the program is introduced in England in April 2018 everywhere.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a form of HIV medication taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of infection with HIV.
The results of clinical trials indicate that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there is a sufficient amount of certain medicines in the human body that prevent HIV from becoming infected.
Such medications can be taken daily or at least two hours before the intercourse.
Suitable candidates for treatment include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and can not receive treatment.
Clinics identify suitable people who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transsexual people and those with HIV-negative partners who do not receive antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there, will also be able to register their wish to participate in the local Sexual Health Clinic participating in the program.
The program costs ¬£ 10 million and NHS England signed an agreement to receive medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the true potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of who is intended to be and how it is consumed and applied in a large image.
Steven said, "This new, large-scale intervention should complement and leverage a widespread and increasingly successful fight against HIV transmission.
This is another milestone in more than three decades in the struggle for one of the greatest health problems for humankind. "
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT, said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted properly for those who need it and who belongs to a risk group, offers the opportunity to change England's HIV epidemic.
Since September, large HIV-infected people in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and independent of negotiating with a partner in a NHS-sponsored clinical trial, thus improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, Managing Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "It is now crucial to ensure that a clinical trial across the country is quickly delayed and that no single member of the HIV risk group is left out.
Now that the PrEP Clinical Trials Medication has been procured, we are on their way to protect the more than 10,000 people at risk of becoming infected with HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, Deputy Chief of Public Health, said: "The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and very delayed after months of delays and the dragging of government legs.
Evidence shows how great a change this drug can bring to the HIV prevention work and the cessation of the spread of its living infection.
This clinical trial takes us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that a clinical trial be taken over as quickly as possible to protect people who have HIV exposure and take us a step closer to halting the spread of HIV in society. "
Electricity prices rose 12% in Estonia, but fell in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference between the price of electricity on the next day in the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian price areas decreased by 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering announced.
The main reason for the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia, the average exchange rate of electricity was EUR 34.33 per megawatt hour last month and the price rose 12 percent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price dropped by five percentage points to EUR 36.27 per megawatt hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the Nord Pool system price was EUR 26.37 per megawatt hour.
Prices increased by 12 and seven percent, respectively.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Finland at 75 percent of the previous month's hours in Estonia and 16 percent of the hours in Estonia from Finland.
The remaining 9% of the hours between the two countries did not take place next day.
Electricity flowed between Estonia and Latvia 99 percent of the time between Estonia and Latvia, and 73 percent of the hours used the total transmission capacity.
According to transactions on the last trading day of July, Nasdaq OMX market could have an electricity exchange rate of about 34 in August and 37 euros per megawatt hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affects the production cost of electricity, rose last month, and deals were priced at ‚Ç¨ 5.04-5.47 per tonne.
High-rise living - half-timbered and smart design skirts have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate developer, changed his big Knightsbridge home in 2014 to Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace and the fact that Joanne has not packed his bags and sold the apartment is a recipe for a new design.
"Before that, I lived with a former life partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made a bid on the same day. "
From the first visit, this 93-square meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
At first it was an apartment with one bedroom and a complex layout - it was necessary to walk through the kitchen to reach the bedroom, Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a half floor to use the high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, a lot of light.
These were my demands, "he said.
He hired Duck & Shed, an architectural design studio based in Notting Hill, to use the 3.8m high ceilings and create a home that would not be just a development site, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-parquet floor where one could stand up.
Erfan had to approach things creatively.
"Metal construction is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to restructure the rooms so that they would lie on top of each other without worship.
It was not simply a platform, but we used a steel structure to make sure the height of both the upper and lower rooms was correct. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two rooms in full height in the room, with a lot of dramatic elements.
The half-story opens to the glamorous living space of the old-fashioned copper light from the Retro-window.
Gold furniture with a mirror surface, silver details and retro-light Serge Mouille luminaire emphasize the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, space, and lightness.
Mirrors are attached to both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror will leave the back door of the window opening to another room.
At the entrance, the mirror box serves a storage space for all Joanne cutlery and glassware.
The living room adds the charm of closing the kitchen unit if it is not used, creating an imaginative glamorous space.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, this kitchen is unique because it is a garage-type doorway.
"There was a bit of design blunder in it," Erfan explains the door with a veneered MDF of steel.
"It has a counterweight, so it slips very easily when pushed forward."
Due to the clever use of the space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 additional square meters, an extra bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"After all, the floor space is what you are selling - or one that gives value to the real estate," says Erfan.
"The realtor takes an outdated form in the room and makes calculations based on the floor area."
Here they have been able to increase the floor space, using high quality materials that add luxuries to the room.
"The materials are the ones you touch and that help you create an emotional bond with your home," says Erfan.
"You do not love the electrical cable in the wall.
This is important, but it does not make the heart speak sounds. "
This shows that good design and increased surface area help to make something rather stunning from a rather ordinary apartment.
In fact, they can even create a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
The protagonist, Dane Jensen, is the boss of a Chicago skyscraper who is competing with colleague for promotion.
It does not count anything other than the amount of money earned, which goes beyond all ethics.
His wife and three children look man only early in the morning and late at night.
In the first half of the film, I'm struck by the idea that this is the version of the "Business" world of the "Card House" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech assistant is similar.
What the film goes on, the less the element of the scramble, remains, and the moralizing intention of the filmmakers begins to stand out more and more.
A life-changing experience can lead to cancer of the boy's main character.
Now a choice must be made between work and family life.
A dreaming son at the architect's office makes her father think about Chicago's large buildings on really important things like faith, goodness, love ... without even touching the twin tower disaster.
After the third scene in which the son opens his father's eyes, it seems that the cinematographers are determined to cry about the target audience, because even the most cunning heart-packed viewer can not keep back tears when they see the suffering of a lovely cancer patient.
When a son falls into a coma and his condition seems hopeless, the father will finally understand his work of immorality and make an old man looking for a job.
Now I'm betting myself with my thoughts - if the film is happy, then I reward my exploration after the film's coffee, but if I'm wrong, then the scriptwriter can praise at least one surprise.
For a moment, there is a suspicion that there is no coffee left - when his wife calls Dane to the hospital and the man rushes along the corridor ward in a slow motion.
However, the son is beautifully healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I also feel good about myself - I can already pretty well predict the end of American drama!
Truly honored, the film is well-designed, all the elements necessary for it are available.
You can cry, you can laugh, actresses are good and morals are beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
This film will probably turn up well.
A short new chief of staff plans to curtail presidential media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do the same with that.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trumpin, including news, in the hope that he will keep his superiors in even-tier water.
Here's a snippet of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met his high officials on his first working day, he identified the key issue in the President's Donald Trump White House, which he planned to address to the president's poor information.
Kelly told officials that the information should go through him, either on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis seems completely logical, but others have tried it and Trump's tact has failed to track his media consumption.
President The short relationship with television dates back decades, and even now, when he is in the White House, his TV viewing habits have nowhere disappeared.
"When candidate Trump was angry with dishonest media coverage, she was rewarded to show that she was honestly seen in influential publications," said Sam Nunberg, Campaign Advisor for Politics in February.
Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that, "According to six former campaigners, the key to managing short Twitter habits is to ensure that their personal media consumption also has a steady boon."
All right.
But the idea that the habits of Short Twitter use have never been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that the rest of us do not know are that Trump's tweaks were even more intense without these interventions.
We probably never know the tweets that Trump did not post.
When his helpers managed to save him, even a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But nobody has been able to prevent Trump from continuing to controversy.
Part of the problem lies in the fact that in the White House, which consists of racing clicks, people try to promote their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be trusted.
Politico, reflecting the whole story, wrote in May about the propensity of advisers to feed strategically questionable information to the president.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Present and past Trump subordinates say Trump can respond bluntly to negative press, especially with information harmful to the press, with an obscure view of identifying their source.
This also happened at the end of February, when someone gave a pestilential copy to the president of the internet proxy Charles C. Johnson's website GotNews.com article, accusing Katie Walsh, Deputy Chief of Staff, of being White House's "source of various newsletters."
It does not matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked by Twitter because of mockery or that he did not provide any concrete evidence, or that he has also falsely charged and taken back in the past.
I read the article briefly and began to question Walsh's subordinates. "
Goldmacher added that Reese Priebus, then Chief of Staff, and Rob Porter, Head of the White House, "have tried to set up a system for managing and documenting Trumpini documents".
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager for Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians coming from the capital to the capital do not have the permission to run for bitter appearances.
There are many aliens in the center of Tallinn playing musicians.
Those with whom the storyteller received the story acknowledged that they were playing in the old city without the permission of the municipality.
First we found three street music artists near the Viru gates, who took the same number of dogs.
It was clearly seen that the musicians with rattled shoes and blizzards were backpackers who would take one shower for berries.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the accordion had a funny rhythmic story, while one man juggled with three balls next to him and called for the passers-by closer.
The third man was seated next to one of their rucksacks and smoked a heartbroken sting in his heart.
Their three dogs did not let themselves be disturbed by the passing people.
Bob juggled with Noemi and balls for the accordion said they were playing on the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the band was to collect a ticket for the vessel flying to Soom on the same day.
Asked whether they asked the city for permission to play in the Old Town for music, the heads of Noam and Bob shook.
First of all, we did not know.
Secondly, we will never stay in a city for more than a day or a couple, and most often permits for a month or so.
It does not make sense to pay for it, "Bob explained.
When we arrived at Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were at the musicians and were leaving them.
The group moved with the backpacks and dogs to the junction of the Viru Center to congratulate you.
Viru Street also featured three Polish young men, one of whom played violins, the second clarinet, and the third one was accompanied by an electronic piano.
"We are here to offer entertainment to people to spread music and joy and make money for fuel and living," explained the trio of pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivosh, they are aware of the fact that the city government must have permission to attend.
"Of course we do not have that," he said with joy.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, then there's no problem.
Of course, when the police arrive, we will go elsewhere, but we must try, "he added.
In July, Eesti Pank bought bonds in the euro area central bank's public sector purchasing program for EUR 149 million, while the central bank's bond portfolio increased to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank will not disclose details of purchases.
Estonian Bank President Hardo Hansson has previously explained in an interview with the members of the Riigikogu that the Eurosystem central bank asset management plan includes three different buying programs: covered bonds, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
As a result of purchases, the yield on lower risk assets decreases and it motivates investors to take greater risks.
As a general rule, each central bank purchases its government bonds in the framework of a public bond offering program, and no other government bonds are purchased.
Since the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called "replacement" shares within the allocated amount.
Replacements are also made by central banks in countries where bids matching the purchase plan are limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank generally buys bonds of European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Facility and European Investment Bank bonds.
Eesti Pank buys bonds in the framework of the property purchase program from March 2015.
Meanwhile, Elering bonds were acquired, but in June 2018, Eesti Pank no longer buys Elering bonds.
Since June, the bonds of Elering and Eesti Energia have been bought by the Finnish central bank on behalf of the euro area central banks.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to the "millionaire district"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again in a fierce confrontation with resolute travelers who have ignored the ditch drilled in the council to defeat the field outside their villages.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in the field for the prosperous "millionaire district" near baptized Solihulli Street.
They have returned with the army of horses, children and trucks after they were shot down in May, without letting them mix with the ditch that was plowed to prevent the invasion of the council.
The tactical group found a weak spot on the guards, squeezing their vehicles through an untapped part that was left on foot.
The inhabitants of the Maruvians have been attacked by the council of Solihulli, saying that the council is "useless in dealing with the problem".
One anonymous citizen said: "They moved there on Monday night after they were driven out of Bentley Heath, where they stumbled upon the strangers.
The council must be shameful in order to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were sent away and now they are back again.
They came last night, and probably more. "
He added: "The Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long seals for the protection of its parks.
I live in Streetsbrook, and I'm not happy that I have to continue paying the council fee if the council can not even prevent such a thing. "
One local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said: "It's ridiculous. We just saw how the last of these travelers left, and a new uprising is taking place.
This time, the number has grown and grassland has even been seen in the rice horses. "
A representative of the Solidarity Council said: "We are aware that the land near the Streetsbrook Road has an unacceptable camp site and we will work with the Police of Solihullah. We will take the necessary legal measures to move as quickly as possible.
Evidence gathering is very helpful if as many local residents report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police by dialing 101.
It will help create a picture of the situation for the court if we present them to the case. "
Indrek Saar, Minister of Culture, is also visiting the Weekend Festival, who is glad that Estonia has been able to bring real world titles to the world.
Asked why the Weekend Festival is so important for Estonians, Saar answers that it should be asked by anyone who has enjoyed the full story of the festival for three days.
However, he acknowledges that true masters of his area have come to P√§rnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute top names of this genre of music are brought home - this is often the case in our bat," says the Minister of Culture.
What kind of artists are there on the festival, but Saart is the most talked about?
I find myself relatively old-fashioned and, of course, one of the most experienced artist Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night, is definitely one of the oldest people of mine.
According to his plate, all of us have been twisting ourselves at some point, "he says.
However, he still names a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own makers in Estonia: starting with NO√ãP, and they can be read in whole series.
In fact, this well-known name concentration is very high, "he says.

Audi refreshes the criticism of car manufacturers in the midst of up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it will provide software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to BMW, the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities, including BMW's home town of Munich, which has been considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it will renew three million Merced vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engine emissions.
No business described these steps as recall.
European car manufacturers have been keen to promote the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide released from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment to be used to neutralize exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles in the automotive industry is increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car makers are thoroughly investigated, Chancellor Angela Merkel's administration is also accused of luring powerful car manufacturers and ignoring signs of a problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes that were silent on the use of so-called tactile devices, which allowed adjusting the exhaust emission for compliance with the regulations while testing the car, but retreated in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the department of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former chairman Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and can go to trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was pulled into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when the authorities blamed the installation of the Audit system to circumvent the European emissions requirements, expanding the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Involving Audi in research may be a big deal for Volkswagen, a luxury car manufacturer generating a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen's profits.
Estonian schools purchase 20,000 euros for European Union flags.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy Estonian schools by September 1 to buy European Union flags for the presidency.
In total, there are 570 educational establishments in the European Union with a size of 105x158 centimeters.
The flags are intended for indoor exhibition, they must also be carried out in high-quality printing indoors with tunnel fixation, the ERR news portal mediates.
The logo of the flagpole has the text: "Gift for Estonian schools to mark the first presidency of the Council of the European Union.
Estimated cost of 570 flags is estimated at EUR 20 000 by the Ministry of Education, or one flag will cost EUR 35.
The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
Employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review plans for the most recent chaos in Sinaloa, sown by organized crime, corrupt officials, and untold drug trafficking.
But today they have accumulated their personal security in the shadow of personal tragedy.
They are told that it's important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists are discussing which one feels safer: either bring the kids to their office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words to the board at the front of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They ask the reporters not to give names in each column, there is no need for evidence, enough for inspiration and insight.
In government or cartel revenues, drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of having a full list of bullies, which are dangerous to reflecting chaos in Mexico.
According to the Journalists' Protection Committee, since the capture of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012, at least 25. 589 journalists have been subjected to national security since the attacks and threats, and at least seven journalists in seven states have been killed so far this year.
The last deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, co-founder of Riodoce Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in his book on drug abuse.
His absence makes him feel deeply, although his presence can be perceived across the facade of the Riodoce building, a large picture hangs on a middle finger flashing Valdez with the letter "Justice," and two of the 30th reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts featuring his smiling face or panamac shirt.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death. Reporters are discussing a common trauma, their horror moments, insomnia, and paranoia.
Although a separate State Prosecutor's Office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, only two cases have been taken from the JKC.
As for most of the annual drug-related and organized crime murders of thousands, journalists killers are rarely prosecuted.
Riodoce continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, there is no security meeting without the data of the murderers and the lack of justice.
"It's very hard to waste your time at this meeting," he says.
"Until the cause is known, do not trust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital, Culiacan, on May 15th.
He managed to drive only a couple of quarters before two men stopped him at the red Toyota Corolla, he was forced to leave the car and was shot 12 times. This is supposed to be due to the name of the newspaper, which means translated "the twelfth river".
The armed man went to Valdez's car and made an accident nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left with a woman and two adult children.
Rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's theme is mainly silent.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the release to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the worst battlefields in the country since rival clashes are fighting for power outage.
It's no different that on the streets of Sinaloa, a person is shot down or even several times a day, or that the cemetery is cluttered with abundantly decorated two-dimensional drug kings' manor houses that are larger than many living houses.
Let's forget for a moment that the time of the world refers to the fact that only one cartel leads to valuable ports and US maritime routes to the seaside state.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work, co-founder and chairman of Riodoce, Ismail Bojorquez (60), saw immense guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first of these was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the ninth-year-old cartel on Guzman's sons, competing and war-torn cartels in February.
This item could have hurt the sons of the suspected gang members, bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they arrived in newsstands.
Another mistake was the fact that Valdezi was not forced to leave the country after leaving for his own security after a raid took place in another newspaper article that mentioned the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in the crackdown on journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to exist forever.
He worked as a veteran reporter at Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce by selling $ 50 units.
Bojorquez said that it was impossible for Sinaloas to deal with the press without touching the drug problem.
The newspaper, over time, gained recognition with its courageous and honest reflections, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish vigorous research without fear of censorship and readers in the lyrical edition of which they were able to read stories that nobody else dare to reflect.
Eighteen years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot's prize for its Latin American celebrations.
In the same year, the Valdez Prize for International Journalist Freedom of the Journalists' Protection Committee (AKC) won its courage to follow Mexican drug dealers everywhere it leads.
She frankly admitted that she was afraid.
"I want to live," he said, accepting the AKK Prize.
Last October, she told the TV channel Rompeviento TV in an interview that drug trafficking is a Sinaloa lifestyle.
"You have to embrace the task that the Journalist Office brings with it another way of playing football.
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I did not talk about what was happening. "
The Riodoce collective longs for Valdez, a fool who rode like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared his arms and tips, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always hat his hat.
He went to the El Guayabo Bar on the road and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his routine fiction was fatal to him.
His death has also made them wonder how to do their best and stay alive.
"They do not like being beaten up by women, their children, their legitimate business, their secret landing sites, used for drug trafficking."
"These things should not be touched," Bojorquez said.
As a result, even in the best of times, a strong self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your instincts.
If it smells suspiciously, stay away.
According to Andrew Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, the problem is that "the smell can be deceived ... and that's what happened to Javier".
He and others say that Sinaloa is no longer subject to the old rules, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, or in other states that are home to toxic communities of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt civil servants.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce's staff gathered for security training, mobile phones were not suddenly allowed, some days before it was revealed that only spyware sold to governments was used to track journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two policemen were looking for relief from the tree in the shade of 40 degrees.
The government appointed them to guard Riodoce's office, located in a four-story building in the middle class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters pondered on whether these policemen belonged to the 50 percent of the police, whose governor had stamped himself unreliable.
How many months has passed since reporters have traveled to mountainous areas where de facto control of drug traffickers is in place.
This week's edition of Riodoce covered three main topics.
One of them was the murder of a former boxing lieutenant, Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story of spending government money on the governor's home town.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one quarter from the cabinet of the prosecutor.
There was no official announcement about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write what all the city knows about the restaurant is a favorite place for both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered as a politician, who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
More recently, several IRP Governors have been blamed for corruption cases under widespread lawsuits.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about the incidents in the same place, including how Guzman's son, nicknamed El Chapo, escaped from the military.
Just a few months ago, readers would have been looking for Waldez Column to get information on kidnappings from the best sources.
"In the past, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, whose elastic body building has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all channels of communication have broken off with our sources."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers that protest against the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they never could expect from activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of signs and headed for another journalist to the local prosecutor's office the following morning.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the slaughter of Valdez.
The dead body was found to burn and, according to officials, it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists have become more louder throughout the country, and the phrase "SOS press" is shaken by organized protest on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, Bojorquez is headed off in Washington, attempting to win international support in order to bring justice to justice in the Valdez case.
The day after meeting Valdez with the Governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of knocking down the truth and telling journalists about their killing.
After that, he asked that he be diverted from the reflection of the government's activities, worrying that his anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are "restricted to" organized crime, cowardly civil servants and indifferent societies.
In his latest book, "Drug Reporting," he wrote that reporters would not be killed only by drug users, but also by politicians and security forces who are involved in organized crime.
More than half of the journalists' attacks on the police and government officials last year were attributed to the Articulo 19 Media Monitoring Group.
"In Mexico you die because you want to silence," said Ramirez.
Murder obviously affects blood pressure.
No one will forget about the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border region of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found along with a letter allegedly signed by the Los Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my reports."
Next to his scarred head, computer keyboard and headphones were leaked.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, for example, in the newspaper in the northern border of El Norte in Chihuahua after the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others will continue to do the same as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of their leader in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez talked to drug dealers with a publicly-placed cover page entitled "What do you want us about?".
Some journalists have disappeared from home countries or even from the country.
It's a nerve-cutting decision.
It's hard to find work in exile and they still have to hide the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they are being shot behind, as was probably the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in 2015 in an apartment in Mexico, three months after the Veracruz trip.
Those who stay in place and continue to work must daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who ever wanted to become a poet, acknowledges that scaring a drug dealer scare him.
"Mexico is on the way to hell, and that's why I started to report," he said.
On the last Friday night at midnight, when the latest number was already locked, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and sipped beer whenever the phones started to vibrate suddenly.
At the beach-resort resort in Mazatlan, 19 people were killed in incidents involving riot gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised a number of messages from cartels found in the region.
From the edge of the pavement, reporters put the Riodoce website on the news mobile phone.
Next day the front cover needed to be changed.
The sirens flew along another flare in the area.
Bojorquez peered at the police officers in the watch to see if they were alert.
When they feared, they did not show it at least.
Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, where his middle finger is seen all over Sinaloa, the Riodoce workers were edited in his footsteps.
"How could one think about closing down," Bojorquez said, "when the trainee asked the same day that Javier was killed to send him a report on the streets?"
Dinosaurs used protective coating to prevent enemies
At first glance it looks like a shape, though quite scary.
Researchers have now revealed the first findings regarding the existence of an incredible rhinoceros size discovered by the Canadian miner, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as "Monas Lisat dinosaurs."
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to find that the skin covered with his scaly was reddish-brown and his past was somewhat "complex".
The report, published by The Current Biology, described the existence as "the best preserved fossil nose that has ever been found" and "one of the best dinosaur enthusiasts around the world."
Fossil is a new species of nodosaur, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous, 110-112 million years ago.
The incredibly good survival of the scholars caught the researchers who describe it as "truly significant".
This physically-grown vegetarian, according to National Geographic, is best preserved for this type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was found on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined Suncor Millennium at Fort McMurray near North Alberta in Canada.
He hit something that did not remind the surrounding stone, and decided to investigate further.
The fossil discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
For the next six years, it was developed to plant an outbreak of 2500 pounds (1,100 pounds) of land.
After all this hard work, the end result is finally ready for the public to come.
"If one casts a little eyes, one can almost believe that he is sleeping," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the beings are exposed.
"It's going to be one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur enthusiasts, the dinosaur mona Lisa."
Researchers have found that, in studying the skin, researchers who found that a herbalist who was covered with scales and resembles a walking tank was likely to be significantly threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
This dinosaur with plenty of scales used red and white protective shades to hide from predators, and applied a shadow technique called a counter-shield, which is also used by many modern animals.
According to experts, this allowed the dinosaur to merge better with the surrounding area and prevent enemies, as larger dinosaurs thought it was likely to hunt.
This 110-million-year-old nodosaur family came to the news for the first time in May and is now visited by the Royal Tyrrell Palaeontological Museum.
Researchers have now studied the name and named it Mark Mitchell, Labor Marketchell Museum in Borealopelt, a famous crew that spent more than 7,000 hours on the animal's demanding exposures.
Thanks to the amazingly good survival of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the scars in the animal's body.
They discovered a backlash - a protective method common in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper half of the being was darker than the bottom.
Although the fallback is widespread, the findings come as a surprise, since Borealopelt is much larger than the animals that are laced live today.
It suggests that the other dinosaurs of meat-eating dinosaurs were actively hunted from the dinosaur, that evolution favored escape as opposed to confrontation as survival tactics.
But most of the modern-day animals that do not stand up - such as deer, pigs, or gladiators - are much smaller and more vulnerable to harvest, which suggests that nodosaurs really had to struggle to survive.
"The robust hunting of dinosaurs covered with tremendously large and abundant scales shows how dangerous predators could have been dinosaur in the Cretaceous," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds from Finns also revealed that the dinosaur skin was reddish brown.
Scientists will continue to explore the animal to get clues about this life, including the contents of the intestine, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river in the deaths, reaching the sea, where it leaned back into the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as hot as it was today in South Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely to go far beyond the inland as it is now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved acuminate skin, while remaining three-dimensional, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal nowadays looks almost the same as in the chalk period.
You do not have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it - just enough to cough your eyes and feel like he's asleep. "
The Credited Age was the time when huge dinosaurs of meat-eating dice-rabbits, teropods, roamed on the Earth.
Although all of them, the Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelt, some of its frightening predecessors could hunt down this armored dinosaur.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5-meter) long, six-tonne monster.
Scientists, whose recent findings are published in The Current Biology, believe that Borealopelt was flooded after being dying in the sea and mummified in mud.
Olevus discovered Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 when he mined Millennium at Fort McMurray near North Alberta in Canada.
According to the museum, it is best preserved in the Finno-Ugric world, including the skin and scales, and it is a comprehensive cone to the hips.
These creatures were average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Two 20-inch-long sunshine struck from his shoulders.
Scientists believe that this shrewd plant trapped through the present West of Canada, until the flooded river flooded its open sea.
But the dinosaur's immersion burial place helped to maintain its scales in detail in detail.
The hardened remnants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that skinny curves continue to cover the voluminous armchairs along the dinosaur skulls.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine: "This degree of survival is as rare as a lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it sounds.
The hardened skin tones still cover the voluptuous armchairs in the animal's skull.
The right forehead lies next to him and the five toes are upright.
I can count the scales on his back. "
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Whats the streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell became a complete shock.
Just a day after New York City, she sat on the bed in a room leased through Airbnb in St. Louis, scrolling through Facebook.
He got into the post of his former schoolmate.
It read: "The 18-year-old boy was killed by the police and he still lags on the street."
He was confused as to why nobody else had posted this information to his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Posts tagged with @TheePharoah were repeatedly shared in his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis district spoke in real time about Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who died in Missouri, Ferguson, a white police officer.
He posted a picture of Brown's life from a body that lay on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
She dropped her phone, but later again she saw the tune that was announced this time about people gathering at Canfield Drive.
Shared photos of police guys and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept the letter with the letter "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son!".
He watched a stream in real time, where the policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman rammed up a gun and shouted, "I'll kill you all ... animals."
Ferrell recalls how he was struggling: "It's unusual."
"" This is not a murder of the kind we are used to and what we might call typical. "
I felt terrible at that moment.
I was angry and cried. "
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After landing at 23, he went to his dad next to his six year old daughter and decided that they would fly Ferguson the next morning.
What's going on with Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is a central issue in the new documentary "Whose Streets?", Which premieres in cinemas on August 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness from the point of view of the people who live in this community and who responded to the demands of the streets.
When Ferrell and her daughter, wearing a flower dress and wearing a suitable crown on her head, traveled to Ferguson, they talked again about the topic of what they had talked about earlier this morning - the experiences and living conditions of the Black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community was to fight for his rights?" He remembers himself.
"We're driving Ferguson right now, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I could not take her," Ferrell said later.
"What is happening right now is ... the culmination of the past.
He needs to know and see this and grow up in the middle.
He must learn about activism and organization, while also recognizing the different layers of experiences and living conditions of the Black people, and what we need to do to get free and to free ourselves.
Even if I succeed in cultivating him so that he does not personally experience blatant racism, he does not differ from another black-haired girl.
I feel that I would have fun with him if I defended him for this world. "
The first stop they made when they reached Ferguson was South Florianso, a roadside crossing from the police station, which had become a kind of campsite where activists were waiting for news about police officer Darren Wilson, who was ultimately not indicted.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who was preparing lunch.
They put together food bags and helped them share the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism began to slowly take shape.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he said, noting that while he was a student at Missouri University in Louise, he was president of the Minority Student Union and focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
"I did not have any organizational experience.
It's all just over. "
A week later Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, co-director of the film, during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and the film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to simply document the incident.
Ferrell's question arose: "Are you trying to document what's happening or find a story that can be exploited?"
Such skepticism was due to the countless number of cases where people - often human beings - come to the community and try to profit from it's pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson was not heard, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already clashed with co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the region, who was known for activism in connection with the death sentences.
His involvement made the project fascinating for Ferrell and for the other six other local people whom the team "Whose Streets?" Has been monitoring for a number of years since Brown's shot.
"In this documentary, nobody speaks for us or us, but we speak for ourselves," said Davis.
"It was important for me how these people are portrayed, since they are also depicting me."
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was intended to show that the movement was not a "redemption guide, but a meeting of the community," as Folayan said, making him the most open party to the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" Documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as love and marriage with his wife.
"I felt as if I were naked," said Ferrell, laughing for the first time when he was ready to see the film.
"But I realized that the humanization of this work and the blackmail of people must be accompanied by some vulnerability."
What's more, Ferrell's story emphasizes and redresses the role of the black-haired homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two movers from three initiators who thought social media in the aftermath of the murder of Black Blues teenager Trayvon Mart in 2012 was the topic #BlackLivesMatter, is homosexual.
"In the leading role, black-haired homosexuals have kept moving around in general," said Ferrell, "and that is precisely because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black-blooded homosexual women must bear all this burden. "
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed held by black women in the lives of many, and many are homosexual black-women".
He argues, however, that "it is not a matter of creating a sort of equal opportunity" - Ferrell was not chosen as the center of the film for his identity.
"He was a person from whom the right energy flowed," he said.
"But it's not coincidence that he was right on the front line because of the fact that a black homeless female in such nodes lives a lot at stake.
His energy can be perceived through the screen. "
At the same time, news cameras from Ferguson have long been lost, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
Convicted sentences for road blocking during Ferrell's demonstration last 2,5 years.
He describes the socio-political climate in the area he calls home just as "great freedom".
Nevertheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra that he has etched in memory since he walked to Ferguson all three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We do not have to lose anything beyond our chains. "
7 dash how to overcome the night after the weekend party
Some of the hardest guys find that after a nasty party feast, that's what's left of it, help.
Or, they are based on the saying "do not be afraid, stay drunk".
But this is just an inevitable postponement and a good thrill for health.
What can you do to make your morning and future weekend's trolling or other party feel better in the morning and get as painless as possible over the bumpy?
Drink water
Alcohol under and over, after a big party in the morning ... or possibly even in the place of alcohol.
As the body loses a lot of fluid through the use of alcohol, it must be recovered in some way.
Mineral substances are also flushed with water, and so it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after coughing, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or just slightly aerated.
Go walk
Certainly, with a bombardment, no one would go to the granny to break down the trees - it could prove fatal to make a false decision.
But a light stroll can help you remember what it feels like to be alive.
Tenting and trowelling is a more time-consuming way of healing.
Give your body energy back slowly and carefully.
If you are already running out of the last night, you should not try to load a large fat oven on the stomach.
For example, start with a fresh juice that contains fruit sugars to keep your body quiet.
If lunch is already a health problem, you might try, for example, a broth.
And somewhat later on back.
Avoid Coffee.
This diuretic releases your body from the last of the water.
As already said: water and juice are your friends.
Do not bet on analgesics.
If you take a pain reliever in the evening to prevent bloating, then your liver should also treat paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol, and then lose that capacity.
So the damage to your liver is even greater, and in the future, the worst is worse.
In addition, the analgesic does not persist for a long time in the body.
If you take an analgesic in the morning, do not take it on an empty stomach - it will irritate your already stomached stomach.
Or if you do not have a partner, you will be well with yourself.
Affects roughly the same way as walking, but walking can not be an orgasm.
However, avoid over-active pace and rough posture - during exercise, physical exertion should be moderate.
Make fun
Talk with friends and fellow humans, make simple bumps and laugh kindly about yourself and others (suffering).
Laugh and laugh may not blow away, but it's surely possible to endure the aftermath with them.
Once the bump goes over anyway!
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University staff are being searched for suspects in a murder
Police say the Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University staff are searched all over the country, who have been suspected of finding a dead man's deathbed in a Chicago luxury apartment after a deadly snap.
According to Cook's county court documents, on Monday, arrest warrants for a 42-year-old Wyndham Latham and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were arrested on charges of arrest for first-degree murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, the 26-year-old died of Cornell-Duranleau after repeated biting.
According to a warning issued to the community by the Chicago Police Station, the body was discovered on July 27th.
The police received a phone call and at the arrival of the Grand Plaza apartment they found a victim whose body had several stabbing holes.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene and investigators are considering biting as a murder, while the police are actively seeking two suspects.
Lathem has been working as a co-professor of microbiology and immunology since 2007 at Northwestern University.
The university's public affairs vice president, Alan K. Cubbage, said in an e-mail message that Lathem is now temporarily removed from work and has been banned from entering Northwestern University's city streets.
"It is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is working with investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior assistant at the Oxford University Finance Department.
A university spokeswoman for the University of Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to help US research institutions in every possible way."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted to give up.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief of Communications, Chicago Police Department, strongly recommends that the suspects be brought to power.
"Police have a sense of where they are staying, but we are increasingly addressing the definition of precise location," said Guglielmi.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities can help locate suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police had received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment house, who had just received a cryptogon that there was something in the apartment no. 1008.
According to the police, it was a poor sight.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on July 27th.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's stay in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," added Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza management wrote to the residents: "The police are currently working on the chronology of the events and the background of the victim, and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that it was a family affair."
Identities that help your business avoid getting to the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees in her e-commerce company, but the polls were profitable.
The responses were often vague, useless, or even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company that sells baby care products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called on outside persons to help.
Emerging startups are new types of human resources that help companies find out what their employees are feeling.
Developing and licensing software with a specific purpose to measure employee engagement allows them to make sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide anonymity and hotline complaints to employees, and in some cases allow libraries to go beyond C-level managers and apply directly to the board.
"There are now tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" Asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City's parent company Glint, whose software analytics tools companies use to measure employee engagement.
According to Errett, during the three years that he has used Glyn, he has received a much better insight into what his employees are thinking and feeling.
In addition to surveys targeted at abrupt investigations and specific teams, this company's thermal card provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which leaders have the lowest support, allowing them to find out the reasons.
Businesses are beginning to realize that they need to stay up to date with their work culture in order not to become the next Uber, which has been entangled in scandals since the former employee posted a blog post describing a harassing environment that punished those who dared to speak.
For start-ups such as Glint, an insight into the desire to have a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation and compliance can be estimated at more than $ 118.7 billion by 2020, according to the data provided by the financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convergent, a home based company in Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw interest and activity grow in the background to Uber's dubious reputation.
Convercentil has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered itself as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send custom impulse polls, collect real-time confidential responses, and view heat maps from troubled areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
And, as the CEO approached, complaints go straight to the board.
"Public opinion has been handed down by regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, Founder and CEO of Convercenti.
Quinlan said that if one finds that the company is treating its employees badly or behaving unethically, then the company may face severe consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee departure and lawsuits, even if regulatory authorities do not interfere.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 sites, has used Converts for more than a year to ensure staff awareness of policies and practices and provide an easy way to communicate with corporate headquarters.
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the corporation's headquarters phone number or e-mail address, file a formal complaint, and hope that it will be taken seriously.
This was often a frustrating and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday, general counsel for James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to monitor employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convertible, there are potential problems, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices, which have not previously been able to identify and deal with managers who have operated in other cities or state-owned offices.
"I can get closer to employee 360-degree 360 degree experience," said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"And we will protect our partners in litigation with employees."
Quinlan said companies began to take ethical behavior, values and employee involvement more seriously in 2002, after auditing firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations of the Enron scandal.
But only when "social media became mature," the companies realized that they could not prevent their black laundry from being publicly washed on the web.
"Before using technology to track ethical behavior, people used the strategy as a source of hope," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking companies a periodic fee for using their products.
It is a business model and an option that has the approval of venture capital investors who have been supporting both of these start-up companies.
In February, the convertible funded companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised $ 47 million in capital.
Glint invested $ 10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing the company's total funding to $ 60 million.
Such investments do not come as a surprise, given the interconnectedness of business, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that today's employees are more likely to wait for jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy at the company, they feel they are listening and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, vice president of corporate profits and employee experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convertent and Glynn.
Investors earn revenue when their portfolio companies do well, businesses are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If the third-party analytics tools allow you to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder that they will find support.
Ownership of data on employee involvement is important for professional culture.
However, these data are useless if the company's supervisors do not do anything about them.
In fact, if the company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that changes are expected.
And if the changes do not happen quickly enough or not at all, it can lead to frustration and reduce employee involvement.
"When you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be ready for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of the consulting and business management firm Kotter International, who has seen how companies make a mistake in relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things are not finished, employees will think:" Did you actually hear me?
Do you care
And if you do not care, why should I care? ""
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now arranges monthly surveys among employees, was able to implement measures on the same day as the problem was reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from disgruntled staff after deciding on the speed and quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and provide communication training for dealing with problems.
However, Ruby Tuesdays are gathering new data on employees and it is expected that in the long run, it will lead to a longer-term employee engagement in the industry, known for its high turnover volatility.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, then you lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses. "
The brightest star in the euro area is the Baltics: incomes are growing fast
Although the 2008 crisis and trade issues with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic, the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the rich countries of Western Europe, reports Bloomberg referring to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, gross domestic product per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
The success is due to low debt burden, fast-paced institutions, and business and free market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic countries with Slovakia are among the few euro area countries where the real GDP per head of purchasing power has significantly converged to the EU average," the central bank said.
Although the goal is to make the total per capita GDP equal to the wealthiest Western Europe, by 2015, the total production of the Baltic economies per capita was only 2/3 of the 15 average countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Balts to seek better salaries from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light, and the economy is also growing this year, the local population is not at all enthusiastic.
According to a recent Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvia's and Lithuania's residents estimated that their economies are doing well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, it was estimated by slightly less than half of the respondents in the economies of their countries.
The NCAA's decision to cancel bodybuilding exercises makes Bruins days longer
It's almost 23 hours when the UCLA football team trousers stop talking to the team on campus at the new training ground.
Some of them have shaved off a shirt, revealing the sweat's back with their efforts on the first day of their training camp.
For most of the crew, these power mins provide mid-day breaks.
Players taking part in summer courses will return after three hours to return to college for final exams before they return to the Wasserman Football Center at 6.30am next morning.
"The next three days are a real challenge for them," said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the two-day training sessions to reduce the load on the players has in fact extended their days - at least until the final examinations to one on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA's first three training sessions were scheduled to start at 19.15 to fit the player's already tight timetable.
The transition from two exercises per day means more days per train - the start of the Bruins training camp was raised almost weekly ahead of the previous season and for the first time in the Mora Six Westwood season, training takes place during the summer courses.
They will have 18 training sessions until August 20, before the official preparations for the Texas A & M Open Championship in September begin.
According to Mora, he is the NCAA's policy change, although it adds another item to the close graphs of the players.
"They have a tremendous burden for three or four days and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they break through this test; they tighten, they are great young people.
I believe that when it comes Saturday and we have more time, it's really enjoyable. "
When the camp is complete, the UCLA training is closed, which is not an easy task, given the clear view of their squares near the parking lot and the adjacent center of Luskin, a higher-class hotel that has already hit hinged football around the gateway around the gateway.
Since the weekend, Bruins has been captured by the hotel, but Mora has admitted that there may be problems with vacations during the season.
"We will apply security measures," said Mora.
"This is a real concern and it is not exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and then work out a movie.
If you have a training session, you can do a pretty good deal.
But we use the security team there and on the 8th parking lot.
We make the best using the existing one.
I will try not to worry about this.
We have a plan in place. "
The Savisaare-Ivanova Electoral Association, born in the Center Party for Savvasare-Ivanova, who was born from the Center Party and elected by Kristiina Ojulandi, who was arrested by the Reform Party, and Kristiina Ojulandi, who was forced to leave EKRE, joined the Our Lady and our party members.
Chickens are considered to fall in the autumn, and the key question is whether they have enough disappointed voters for everyone.
Who's on Savisaar?
If the support group of Edgar Savisare has diminished, it can be foreseen to celebrate events organized in honor of his election bloc.
One member of the Riigikogu, some of the former and current middle-aggressors and many unidentified faces - can this be the composition of an election coalition?
And why is the fact that some of Saviasaar's loyal supporters and friends are being abandoned in Tallinn, can it be sought to become a reality in the "Savisaare List" of persecuted corrupters and corruption offenders?
The music video filmed on the roof of the city government on a Russian-language pop star, in which the elder of the Lasnam√§e district participates, and in all respects an original computer game in which the protagonist Prime Minister J√ºri Ratas avoids the sparks and squirrels on the road when he rides a wheel - is this the first attempt by the Central Party for the election of 16- and 17-year-
Let's wait for the other parties' perceptions of the youth election campaign.
If Channel 2 or TV3 viewers check the black box from the start of August instead of the entertainment broadcast, then there are two choices: agree that in the future only ETV, ETV2, ETV +, Tallinn TV and English24 French24 channels will be released on a free flight, or will be handed over to some telecoms every month by tenth.
It is also likely that those who initially rejoice at ad-free telecasts, but ultimately, though reluctantly, pay tv and advertising.
The choppy music, the noisy people and the junk left on the streets are the unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you do not want to get involved, it's worthwhile to find out wherever your head is hurting home, and leave the sleeping place for a lush sum for the festival guests.
Washington changes the rules of the green card
Media quotes are President Donald Trump, who said that a new US immigration plan is planned, which will change the rules of the Green Card.
The plan foresees a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work patterns and restrictions on family-orientated visas.
The new rules have been offered by the Republicans and the president supports them.
The bill is going to be discussed at the two congress congresses.
"This law reduces poverty, raises salaries, and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers' money, as it changes the way green cards are issued to citizens of other countries of the United States.
The law will reduce the number of links and will replace the current program.
The new application process will be an advantage for candidates who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that come to our economy, "said Trump, according to the United States media outlets.
Young Siberian Seth move to town, pensioners return to the countryside.
Ancient Yevseyev Anatolia continues the tradition of the famous Seto gold miners, dating back to the ancient Maana River.
She works from a home 140 kilometers from the Maana River near Kuva, a goldsmith car.
It's a tough job: for two consecutive months, without rest days, 12 hours of work, then only ten days at home and again back.
During the three years worked in Artel, Anatole has seen gold only once.
"There is a hard time: when entering, it is thoroughly checked that no vodka will come and go out so that gold will not be taken," says Anatoli.
Mare Piho talks to the local Seth Jaan in Haida, who has talked a lot about her family's memories in Siberia.
The archaic culture still preserved by the Siberian Setos will also affect home-setos, as it is just so fabulous, Piho Mare, who has studied the most complete remote Siots.
His first research trip to Siberia will last for 30 years this year.
During this time he has been there 14 times and lived for one year.
How many sedges still traveled to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to get here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I say that 8000.
I took that out of the Siberian Seth men's tales, who have thought about it themselves.
It's hard to say, because at that time up to 30 people could come in one group, but the pass was only given to a man.
Pass was given only to one, but she had children, sisters and other female relatives.
See how big this territory was here!
It was several times larger than the historic Setomaa.
It was necessary to educate, manage it in any way.
The Settys came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because they came here to areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also with the river (logging), gold mines, and industry.
For example, in New Caledonia, many Seto went to work in a secreted city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (built by the Soviet power uranium enrichment plant - J.P.) when it was formed.
Did the Seto then make up the majority of the population in the region?
Yes, they lived compactly.
In addition, there was a long tradition of marriage and a lot of infamy.
Seven to eight children in the family was common.
How much Siberian Seth culture differed and differed from that of rural sediments?
They are different, although the one that was brought here was once there.
They brought a lot of folk costumes.
They did (folk costumes) themselves, but they always did what was brought about and what was done here.
Climate change has strongly influenced the traditional clothing of Seto, because it is much colder here.
The food changed.
For example, in Setomaa, the meat was salted, but it was simply frozen here.
Where are the villages of the Siberian Setos and what life is there for? / Graphics: Alari Paluots
Communication with my motherland was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now Setumaa is about to give it back, it will affect them.
These girls, who have lived here in families, have listened to amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Seth delegation, who came to Haeda's village in the beginning of July to the Seto kingdom and lived in homes for four days - J.P.
What's going on here is fabulous.
"It's very easy to get to and from Tapala, because the city has a great location: at the railway junction and at the intersection of the highways," says opera reagent Reigo Tamm from Tapat.
The city is no longer merely a military capital, we have plenty of nature, sports and cultural places, and the seal is available on every corner.
Tapa is the top-notch city!
There is a small islet in the city through the rolling White Sea, where slaughtered people usually practice yachting.
"It does not look so beautiful on the train window," notes Reigo.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in the river, because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, you can do it!
You can have a picnic and just romance on the river's trail - you can look at the flow of the river and think about life in front and back.
I also went there with my brides.
The oopersol Tamm has been practicing among his three Arabs among the three rivers most on the river: "Because this place is by the city, one may not come across when their stories go straight."
"There is a wonderful view of Tapa on the Mine Mountain, but there are also health trails where you can run, winter, and now you can play discgolf, for example, a golf course has been made and discs can be rented from a fitness center," Reigo says.
The old profs, of course, go with their own disks, but I have not yet played it.
It is likely that Mr Rasmus will call Kull Tapa because he is an experienced discgolf player and he has discs available.
He'll lend me!
Reigo and M√§nnikum√§gi were inseparable from the time of childhood of the current opera singer.
At least during ski lessons.
There are a lot of tears, frustrations and my sport in this mountain.
Not to mention broken carriages and skis.
"The whole city center is full of construction work, it's all becoming unrecognizable," commended Reigo.
The old and tired wax building, however, is a very attractive place where summer shows are played.
I am glad that in 2012, the head of R.A.A.A.M, M√§rt Meos, adopted my idea and came up with a theatrical summer theater.
Although this year's theater season with Aleksei Karenin just got through, on August 11, there is the "Ellar" in the railway station when the circle of the old waxhouse moved around in the 1980s.
"From 11 to 13 August, the city of Tapa has opened its home-based open-air waxhouse and cultural events, including a crowd of people," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the city from the age of thirty-nine years.
In the small, yellow palace on May 1, the museum has been a museum since 1994.
"The house is small, but there are a lot of exhibits and tremendous information," praises Reigo's site, full of Tapa city history, most of which focuses on rail and military.
Reigo says that if Tapal goes through all the recommended sites, the stomach will end up in the long run, but fortunately the small town will have full cafes.
"We have good eating places and sometimes sitting in cafes there is a feeling that you are abroad," he describes.
Educated and young soldiers who come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs-cafes, so it's a chilling feeling that you are in Estonia and in your own hometown, but around this is an international community together.
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we are moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping
The TV channel bTV cited the Foreign Ministry, who reported that two Bulgarians were taken into custody in Greece for illegal camping.
Police arrested people in the Sithonia peninsula on the morning of August 1, illegally hired by the group, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but an investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV channel bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and already impose harsh fines on all those who miss the rest in a place that is not foreseen.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Puppies teach the wolves to break the sheep.
Farmers in Hiiumaa will have to give the wolves a "learning material" to their wolf after a break for a year - the wolves that have been taught by puppies have probably already broken a number of sheep.
This year, the wolves have broken sheep in Hiiumaa county three times, with a total of 23 sheep and eight injured, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the corresponding number was only three, a year earlier 124.
According to the data of the environmental agency in synchronization with the breakdowns, there were no wound breeding units born in Hiiumaa last year and information from the hunting council of Hiiumaa said that this year two wolf divisions have been fixed on the island.
On the night of Monday, wolves broke 15 sheep in the Kabuna village of Emmaste rural municipality and injured 18 surviving sheeppoints.
Early in the morning, on the Wednesday morning, the wolves broke one sheep in the Reyeselja village in the pasture and severely damaged the other, who had to make an emergency ward.
The rules for the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft amendment to the Geneva Act on the Transfer of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act to the coordination circuit.
The change in legislation will abandon the establishment of a separate database for both genetically modified (GM) crop locations and operators, using the plant health register as the basis for this.
In addition, the GM crop handler is obliged to have a predecessor arrangement within the prescribed range with a beekeeping person.
Although GM crops are currently not grown in Estonia, we need to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
This is at least as long as there is no decision to declare Estonian GMO free, "said Sigmar Su, Head of Plant Health Department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be purposeful and proportionate, take into account the costs and administrative burden of both the private and public sectors," added Suu.
The draft law abolishes the GMOVS provisions for GM crop location and handlers' data and training provisions, introduces requirements for the handling of GM crops and the commencement of economic activities.
In relation to apiculture in particular, GM's crop growers are now obliged to inform the beekeepers about starting GM crops with the obligation to make an appropriate agreement with beekeepers before cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the information system of the drafts and, if they wish, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
Planned changes will affect, in particular, the people working in the field of plant production, beekeepers and the Agriculture Board.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize MON 810 - is allowed.
So far, none of the Estonian farmers have been interested in cultivating GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no maize herb in Europe, a european stem borer, for which the maize line MON 810 is resistant.
The varieties of this maize line are also bred to the southern regions, and this maize is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In order to obtain the above certainty, the Ministry of Rural Affairs commissioned in 2015 and 2016 studies on seeds of possible varieties of summer wheat, corn and soybean grown in Estonia for detection of contamination with possible GM organisms.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign germs and the study concluded that seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that genetically modified crops are deliberately not cultivated in Estonia, as well as confirmation that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United is recruiting Nemanja Matic in the form of "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited Nemanja Matic in the form of "genius" after being cast in midfielder Sampdoria on Wednesday evening in his debut.
A player bought over ¬£ 40m Chelsea in the last game of the season before the Uefa Super Cup beat Real Madrid 2-1 in a Premier League game with an impressive defense, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on strike.
However, staying away from the Asian Blues season, Maticul was in dire need of a matchmaker, and only 45 minutes left, according to Mourinho, according to Mourinho, who was determined to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he has a football mindset," said Mourinho.
"We help him reach the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other newly recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started out in the Aviva stadium in the initial career as well, and Mourinho started quietly putting his startling man up at the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed that the club has already made "excellent work" by concluding contracts with three of its four priority choices.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realize three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can do four of the four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another joke lover was sent to GSM on Aug. 1, and this time in Muhus.
According to Mati Martinson, a birdwatching living in S√µrve, the first birdhouse was delivered to S√µrve with a transmitter, and this litter already flies, has left the nest and joined the Big Maiden-Suurlahe big nightshirt.
This is because S√µrves does not have any fields of grains, says the Sounds of the Islands.
This Tuesday, already quite late for ringing the kerosene, another Devil's bird got on the sender on Muhu Island.
According to Martinson, installing transmitters is actually an international project carried out by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, one boatman was named "Mati GSM" in S√µrve, Turkey.
"His actions are all on the Internet: how he went to winter in Spain, returning for some time on top of the border between Germany and Poland, and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson spoke.
The British inventor was able to install a microchip in his body to get access to the house by hand and in the car
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could simply open his front door, access the office and even launch a car.
33-year-old Steven Northam has been able to install a small chip between his thumb and forefinger, and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to make life easier with their technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant-anesthetist at the Royal Hospital of Hampshire County, Winchester in Huntsville, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip mounted on cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds to complete the procedure.
The Northam company also replaces the houses and car locks so that they are compatible with the chip, asking for a single pound of 300 pounds.
The married father of one of the children has installed technology for both home and car in the BMW Z4, which starts when it's on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibit cost thousands of taxpayers
According to military documents released by TIME, the White House decided to fly a naval helicopter last month to pay a total of $ 24,000 to taxpayers for the southern courtyard of the American production event.
The Sikorsky VH-3D, a green and white color called "Marine One" when boarded the president, was the central attraction of the event, which took place on July 17 at the White House.
President Donald Trump, senior vice president, Mike Pence and senior officials at the White House, turned industrial products from all 50 states on their tour.
A helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited jointly with a Maine hunt, a Wisconsin-based fire truck and a Mississippi fork-lift truck.
According to documents from the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White Helmeter, the White House ordered a helicopter presence, FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the south yard for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually high profile event," said the commander of the HMX-1, one day before the event, in an e-mail to his boss, Navy's Chief Officer in the field of aviation.
It was stated in the message that the helicopter arrived in the south courtyard on the 17th of July in the morning of 7 pm for the start of the 15th day and will remain there until the yard is cleared between 18 and 21 the same evening.
It was added that, if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second crew would be needed because of the restrictions on working time because of a retreat.
The original flight crew was at the event during the helicopter and the escort security team stayed close to the aircraft throughout its time on the ground.
It was not possible to read out the documents given to the magazine TIME whether the second crew was finally needed or not.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that the HMX-1 examined whether this event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it violates the Hatch Act, and we were told that it would not break," wrote the commander.
"It looks like you do not have a choice," said the chief officer's deputy.
The White House declared the event "Made in America" as the official event and the Hatch Act would not have covered it.
But even in official events there are political tricks.
The President supported the efforts made at the event at the time of the Senate hearing on health reform and endorsed the attempts to curb the government's regulations.
The use of the name "Marine One" or "Air Force One" for a politically motivated purpose is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents have to use them for travel.
However, the requirement to use them as pure photo sessions is unusual.
In February, he briefly approached the president's plane in his Florida campaign in Melbourne in the background, and his Twitter account quibbles with messages that complain about how his predecessor used the president's airplane.
"The White House is very pleased with the display of" Made in America, "where products from all 50 states produced by American workers from American materials were presented," said Lindsay Walters, White House spokesperson.
The HMX-1 teams often conduct pilot missions near Washington and the south courtyard to practice the United States President's White House with a centimeter accuracy.
When Trump had a G20 summit in Germany in early July, 58 test runs took place in the HMX-1 White House.
According to the official, the flight to the flight crew of the "Made in America" was considered to be part of the training schedule for that month.
A super-fast helicopter flew in addition to another 11 hours for "non-presidential missions".
According to the White House, no other exhibit of this event shook the taxpayer's wallet.
According to the Sikorsky representative, the company was not involved in organizing exhibitions in the southern helicopter yard.
The HMX-1 does not preserve the budget documents of the President's flights and the exact costs due to the event are difficult to determine.
But according to the Ministry of Defense's 2017 annual hourly rates, the VH-3D compensation rate is $ 24,380 per flight hour.
In the documents of the front passenger, the length of the flight was noted from its main navy, Quantico, from Virginia in both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount.
"The calculation of taxpayers' costs based on estimated compensation rates is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated reimbursement rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to a RAND survey of 2015, the Ministry of Defense does not include personnel costs, but covers fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
The former spokeswoman for the White House, Sean Spicer, at the time defended the use of the helicopter at an event.
"The point is to show things made this week in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of contributing to our national security and that there are probably hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose work depends on them.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment on which so many Americans have worked hard.
So, of course, it's right to highlight it. "
It is not clear whether Trump was touching the helicopter during the event on the south yard during the event, but he still sat behind the steering wheel.
Within the White House, Trump Sikorsky's representatives turned to journalists for joking corporate products in his private fleet.
"I feel Sikorskyt very well," said the president, "I have three of their products."
Grit Shadeiko - Peace and joy came through the tears
In 2011, Daegus hit the last area of Shadeikot, with an 800m foot trauma and the stadium was hit with a stretcher.
Shortly before, he had received a zero distance in a distance jump in the University of China.
In 2012, Helsinki's EM ruined a low-cost injury, but in its debut Olympics in London, it received 6,013 points in the 23rd place.
However, the misfortune continued.
In the Moscow World Cup of 2013, after a day's sideline, Estonians in the high-stakes record for the long-distance hike had been injured.
Two years later, he received the 15th place in the Beijing World Cup and completed the Olympic Form, but he was more disappointed with the athlete.
The hardest shot was passed last year to Shadeiko, if he did not receive a letter from a Amsterdam highway in a distance jump event.
I would just like to put together one decent multi-round once or twice.
Once, "said Shadeiko.
Worse still was ahead: a month later, his Olympic race was already interrupted due to Rios's back injury at the first barrier.
Time had to be taken off - did I continue to seventh?
Is the two day effort all the more worth it?
The young woman thought for a long time, but found peace.
I got the head clean
It's relatively difficult to describe this experience, but I thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was a time to treat yourself well and think hard.
"I knew that I did not put the piller in a bag yet," says Shadeikh of his self-purification.
I got a clean sheet of paper and go on a new momentum.
According to coach Anne M√§gi, the suffering of the warder was very difficult to see, but he realized that in particular the athlete needs to make himself clear.
He was so devastated by everyone.
It was hard to bear it.
"Grit said that he did not give up and he wants to prove himself worth it," says M√§gi.
Now she has some sort of peace.
She makes her happy.
The race came back in May when ≈†adeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the G√∂tzis multi-round.
At the high-level competition, he improved his personal high-end balloon with a meter (13.89) and ran a record-high time hurdle.
Then the multi-competitor felt that this was not the capability of the capability, but was cleared of just the first race.
M√§gi, who has been mentor for years, says that Shadeiko is a musical student.
He is ready for an athlete, he is well trained.
If something goes wrong or is wrong, he will say it right away.
He knows his own body and trusts his cognition.
We must proceed from this.
I can not say what exactly to do and follow it.
There is also a new approach to ≈†adeiko.
"I'm not the one who does the trennis to the maximum," he says and states that the most important thing is getting the right cognition, because it also guarantees a good result.
A baby baby will be happy
Good luck has been offered to ≈†adeik also for good emotions.
So, his former co-worker, Maris M√§gi, and his sister, Grete, recently became parents, and the multiplayer has gained support from new adventurers.
"It's been really interesting," says Shadeiko.
One drink, the drinking of which is equal to brain training.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is just such a great wine fan that he believes that wine can train the brain better than anything else in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it's not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather the "very active" wine tasting process.
Sniffing the glass, swirling wine, enjoying it and feeling aftertaste, we put our brains in order to create a taste for wine.
According to Shepert, tin molecules do not really taste, but taste comes from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He compares how the brain "looks" colors.
"The taste is not in the wine, the taste creates the taste of the wine," says Sheperd.
For example, what affects the taste of a wine is, for example, our age, sex, and even the amount of saliva that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, pretends that wine is not about to drink.
"There must be more to be done," he says.
If you take too much noise, the system is overwhelmed.
Excessive wine-making can harm damage to the brain - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental ability.
10% of the employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less than their colleagues
Data from the staffing company Fontes reveal that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less than their colleagues.
A ten per cent pay gap is between men and women, writes the Geenius portal.
59 IT and telecommunication companies participated in the payroll survey of the Fund's ICT sector.
A total of 8,577 posts were under consideration.
63% of the posts were made by men.
"Though only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favor of men and that the remaining companies do not have a pay gap, the average monthly salary of men on average is 10% higher than that of women, and the average annual salary of men is 8% higher than that of women," Fontese analyst Ilmar Norden said.
Narcosis Season 3 Promotional Clip: Now that Pablo Escobar has gone, the Netflix hit the Cali cartel
Despite the fact that Narcosis was the target of the Pablo Escobar killer in the second season, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first one has already been completed with a promotional clip that teases the series with new malicious ones.
In the third season, DEA pays its attention to the world's richest drug trafficking organization - the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers, such as the Fortune 500 company, with just more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) of the brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is leading a relationship with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a newly released clip, Pedro Pascali returns to Javier Penana, a character who recruits American and Colombian law enforcement services in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcosis will be on the open air on September 1.
According to the UN, the role of women in democracy in Afghanistan depends on politics
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan, on Wednesday, said that elections could represent the people only if all members of society, including women, played a role in it.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Assistance Mission, said hundreds of women are candidates for local council elections, three women serving as vice presidents, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The emphasis on women's role can not be exaggerated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and be credible only when women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process.
Afghan local council elections and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
For its part, the Taliban have threatened the electoral process, which coincides with the transition period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is calmly transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said women's strong role in the success of democracy in Afghanistan is increasing.
According to the Afghanistan Independent Election Commission, 3.6 million registered voters have 1.2 million women.

A trip to the wider world of the Philippines, or the Bottom Line trip to the heart of the vibrant ones
Strapless bags are summer classics, which has become a separate hit product in the last few years, which even one of the right siblings always needs to hang around, and which, despite its modest origin, has allowed merchants to weld their price tag appropriately.
A strapless bag is probably one of the things that have ever existed in life and whose possessions have not caused any special emotions.
It just exists and if not, then nothing is broken.
Now, however, strawbacks are making a real triumphant journey, and fashion fashions have replaced their fine designer bags with summer straps instead of simple straw-plated bags.
It's not just a beach bag, but today it's just as popular as the street bag, and the bolder women even walk around with it at the office.
However, it is still worth knowing before, whether the summer looks like a boss is still sitting still, or paying a brand and notebook for a slightly more formal summit.
The irregularity of strawbags has, however, made women a true summer fervor.
For example, when reading foreign fashion magazines, the first thing to note is that the Mo-Gurney men take on a local market for the first time on a holiday trip and acquire a piece of ornament for which they are loyal to the rest of the holiday and who travels along the beach, on the market and with girlfriends in the city.
Some bloggers are so pretentious that they buy more bags from the market and sell or give away their loyal readers.
In this respect, it is worth noting that among the readers there is a demand for bags in such a way that, in the real world, women (and men!) Would probably go hand in hand to each other to become a happy owner of some bags.
In some ways, this kind of madness is also understandable, because they are rare in those times when in fashion fame it is possible to buy one thing that has risen in price for just a few tens of euros.
True, clever merchants have also discovered a simple way to make money, and so they sell finer luxury brands on their necks for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Probably still, the richer customers should not feel easy about promoting some kind of cheap bags.
For example, you can buy Dolce & Gabbana over a thousand euros in a straw bag.
However, the interpretation of Chanel's canvas may cost around 6,000 euros.
Unlike most fashion models, however, strawbags are not originated from some of the great fashion shoes, but their story started far away.
Namely, the strawbags originally come from far away from the Philippines, from which they are widely missed.
The sacking of the straw bag is primarily an export business, and local people often do not look at them.
It is said to have originated from the 14th century brachiopods and is fairly common with ordinary bass bulbs.
However, because the shoulder bag does not need to be so tightly plaited as a basket, it can absorb patterns and other materials that make the bag more personal and more attractive.
For example, recently, especially trendy bags with colored ribbons or leather straps have been introduced.
The joke may be sent to the actress Jane Birkin, who had not had the largest strapless strapless bag before.
Namely, he fitted up the shoulder bag with all kinds of garments, and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival even more.
The popularity of bags today does not play a smaller role, but also that caring for them is a kukepea, and unlike any other simadans, they do not need to care for them with special tools, but water and a wet towel are also driven by things.
Still, as with fashion trends, brands have come out with all sorts of interpretations beyond the classical look.
For example, you might want to purchase a straw-plated needle or a small shoulder bag, if you wish.
At the same time, it's worth remembering that a classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, but the shoulder strap is not.
But what's the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, it has been considered a classic bag of straw-plated bag that resembles a basket of its own style, is open on top of it and is short on it, as well as spruces and sticks.

GMB is worried about investing in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The trade union expects MakVitye's bosses to confirm their long-term production plans at the Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent about the future investment of the Tollcross facility.
More than 500 people work in a factory that manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products.
Pladis, owner of McVitie, said they had invested more than ¬£ 5 million in the last few years.
The workers were hired there and the trade union presidents "are the first to hear" when something changes to the factory.
In a letter sent to the Object Manager of the company, GMB Scotland appealed to McVitie to "dismiss the concerns that the funds will not be used to modernize production lines".
GMB senior associate Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we do not get the head of the facility clear about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans makes our members deeply concerned.
Families of several generations have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of local people and people around Glasgow, an essential pillar to ensure decent employment in an area where there is high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, Glasgow needs East in terms of jobs, wages and well-being, and Brexit, an increase in living expenses and McVitie's incredibly fast-growing McDonalds in the wake of the chronic decline in production. "
The representative of Pladise said: "The Tollcross facility manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company responds directly to it, because we value active communication with workers and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between Tollcross employees and representatives of GMB was held openly discussing a number of problems.
We then discussed with the staff that, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested more than ¬£ 5 million in the Tollcross facility, most of which has gone into production lines and operations improvement.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a production site, and if there are any changes in the activities of the site, workers and trade union representatives are the first to hear it. "
Did PSG warn Barcelona about approaching Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up trying to attract Neymar to his ranks by making a ¬£ 189m bid for his redemption, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record-breaking conquest?
This lingering approach has opened the summer shift window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than double the current record world record that was set last season when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for ¬£ 89m.
As the transition is completed, Neymar will, as a result, become the world's most expensive player and also the most highly paid professional sportsman in the world, who will receive over ¬£ 500,000 a week after paying PSG.
Barcelona seems to be angry with both the approach and the free breakdown of Neymar, although a source close to Catalans confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world about this opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif warned stubbornly about all clubs thinking of recruiting a PSG best player.
"I do not worry because they know that if they touch upon some of our players, then we will take action against them and contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to conclude an agreement with one of our players, they must face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this border since the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any conditions and that Barcelona could retaliate as a result of this interest, by eliminating one of its dear assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit.
"Brexi is threatening to hit the keel severely between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned during his first visit to Northern Ireland after his assumption in June.
"I can not imagine who will benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders," he emphasized.
According to Varadak, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and because of this, it would remain part of the European common market.
It would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another option to make the UK move more smooth would be the creation of a customs union between the EU and the United Kingdom, explained the Prime Minister of Ireland.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could surely be like this with Britain."
An alternative to this would be the return to customs posts that would proclaim a historic split and political failure.
"Barriers to trade, prosperity and peace," said Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexity "a challenge for our generation," and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's everyday life.
Irish Prime Minister met with leaders of Northern Ireland's main parties in Belfast.
M√§rt Avandi, who has completed his first half-long triathlon: Ironman can pass through everyone.
Today, in the capital of the capital, Otep√§√§, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltic States was held, when nearly half of the Ironman competition attracted about a thousand triathletes from more than thirty countries.
The 70.3-mile long distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, M√§rt Avandi won the first triathlon of his life.
"I thought it was complicated and eventually complicated," Avand said at the finish.
In spite of the complexity, Avandi said that in fact the triathlon is accessible to everyone.
"It's not a distant kill, but a pace for killing," he said, hinting that almost everyone reaches the finish line at an affordable pace.
Except Ott Sepp: "Well, everything is fine, but unfortunately, he can not swim."
Avandi had been working hard since early February.
At the beginning, 4-5 hours per week, but later 10 hours a week.
By the time 05:34:12, he totaled 270th in the overall ranking.
Although Avandi lost both Raio Pyrobale (time 04:59:53) and J√ºrgen Lig (time 05:06:37), he won other players in the so-called "prominent class".
Last year Tanel Padar lost Avand in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm about an hour (times respectively 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
The general winner of the Otep√§√§ Stage for men in the Ironman series was crowned by Johann Moldan at 3:58:27, the best of Ivo Suur with the time of 04:14:09.
The women won the Danelian Helle Frederiksen with the time of 04:24:01, while the Estonians won Maria J√§nese, who lost to Frederiksen for almost half an hour and received the time 04:58:58.
The Avandis traveled 1,9 km long swimming distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He got out of the water in the 410 position.
