In Estonia and Spain, four members of the Kemerovo group were detained
According to Mailman, police in Spain seized the head of Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group in the Estonian underworld, known in the criminal World under the name of Slava Kemerovsk.
A gulevich detained in Spain was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday the court also took three of the suspects detained in Estonia.
This suspicion concerns the so-called Kemerovo Criminal association with members from 27-57 to 65 years of age, who commit a drug crime.
The alleged head of the criminal community was detained in Spain in Malaga, the province of Málaga.
Three men were detained as suspects in Estonia, one of them is the leading figure of the criminal organisation, and two are members of the criminal association.
The data collected suggest that in a criminal organisation there were clear partitioned tasks and roles.
The aim of the criminal association was to commit drug crimes and thus serve the proceeds of crime ", commented on the criminal case of the pre-trial proceedings, state prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out that a circle of suspects in this criminal matter will increase", the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been involved in the past, and some of them have been punished for drug offences.
The Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish counterparts has been important in the whole investigation period.
"International co-operation has become a standard for us, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation", Prosecutor Verte commented.
Head of the Central Criminal Police Department Ago Leis said that the detention was preceded by a one and a half years of preliminary investigation.
"In the first half of the week, a long-term job was realised and at the same time we were suspicious of the crimes in Estonia and Spain", he said.
It added that the central Criminal police officers were helpful in detesting in Spain.
For years, we have a good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and the civilian guard.
These deductions are another message to criminals that we can catch them from another European end ", said Leis.
The information gathered so far shows that, while at large, men who have been suspected of being at large may continue to commit new crimes and the Prosecutor's Office requested their arrest and the court also accepted it.
A man arrested in Spain is expecting his assignment to Estonia.
Real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized in the context of this criminal matter.
The pre-trial procedure of a criminal matter is conducted by the Central Criminal Police Office for organised Crime and is chaired by the public prosecutor.
Tallinn City Court sentenced Slava Gulevitši 2005. It was convicted of Blackfire and sentenced him to 5 years ' imprisonment.
In the middle of the previous decade, Gulevich was considered to be the second most important man in the world of Estonia in the criminals of the underworld.
Gulevich from Kemerovo rose to the Estonian underworld, highlighting 1990. In the early years, when he started extortions in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed the taxi drivers and prostitutes in different hotels and demanded a monthly roof charge from the businessmen.
International joint operations, seizures of proceeds of crime and final rulings have confirmed that the fight against organised criminal activities is effective.
For example, the most recent judgments, the eight defendants separated from the Dikayev criminal case, and the nine persons seized with regard to the 80 000 of the criminal proceeds, or 9 parties, to the effect that Igor Aleynikov created 2006. In 1997, a criminal organisation, targeted to illegal trade and trafficking in human beings in Ida-Virumaa and south-Estonia.
The proceeds of the seizure amount to approximately 71 500 euros.
The success of these criminal cases has ensured that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues every day, and if necessary, operations are carried out in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns about travelling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored people (NAACP) has been responsible for people travelling to Missouri for the state's discriminating policy and racist attacks.
The application of the group reads: "Missouri, state of the NAACP travel note valid until 2017. The year 28. In August, all African-American travellers, visitors and Missourians are particularly attentive and extremely cautious in moving around the whole state, taking into account the entire range of dubious racial-based events that have recently transferred The state has occurred and is also stated here. "
According to the NAACP, the group encouraged the travel warning to be issued in the recent Missouri law, which would make it harder to win cases of discrimination, as well as the fact that the targets of state law enforcement are unevenly Minorities.
"Human rights of citizens are violated."
They pulled the tea edge because of their skin color, they were beaten or killed, "said the NAACP Missouri branch to the President Rod Chapel newspaper, the Kansas City Star.
"We have never been so tightly treated before."
It is the first such warning that the organisation has issued for the US state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults, the deaths of black students at the University of Missouri and the 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year in suspicious circumstances, after he ran out of gas while driving through the state, and the Missouri police took him into custody without being accused of a crime.
In addition, it refers to the recent report of the Attorney general of Missouri which shows that in the state, 75% of the cars of black drivers are stopped more likely than white ones.
"The remark is meant for people to be aware and to warn their families, friends, and colleagues, of what might happen in the Missouri," said Chapel.
"People have to be ready, so it means taking bail money or informing relatives that they're passing the state."
The latest data from the FBI hate crime programme were documented in Missouris 2015. In 100, it was a hate crime that places the state of similar violations in state 16. Place.
Travel warning is also in response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for a company to sue for housing or work in the field of discrimination.
The American civil Liberties Union ACLU had previously issued travel notes for Texas and Arizona after these States had adopted immigration laws that committed local ability to people...... that were going to Arrest for immigration violations, because ACLU said it would increase racial probesization.
As a rule, travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, stakeholders have begun to use this measure as a response to certain U.S. laws and trends.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, may be caused by five different-A, B, C, D, and E hepatitis viruses.
All these viruses induce acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
A malignant cost, however, is chronic hepatitis B and C, which can further develop into a liver cirrhosis, such as wrinkles and liver cancer.
The epidemiological adviser of the health board Kuulo Kutsar says that the signs of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of hepatic inflammatory diseases-fever, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, greyish stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last sign of disease also comes from the patient's inflammatory name of the inflammation of the jaundice.
In children, hepatitis can run without signs of disease.
Different species of liver inflammation can only be determined from laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can transfer to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without symptoms, which means that the person may not know anything about their harmful liver disease.
The famous Kutser brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes the progress of the course.
(A) hepatitis viruses are spread from A sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, from infected hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, mouths, and drug use.
(a) The risk of hepatitis infection, or at risk, in the form of a family of people with a ill or a person suffering from chronic liver diseases, men who have sex with infections, people having sex with men, and drug addicts, who are visiting high countries.
Infections can be prevented by vaccination, in particular by the vaccination of many travelling and people at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is essential that daily hygiene requirements are complied with: wash or disinfecte hands, to wash all fruits and vegetables before consuming food.
Hepatitis B viruses spread in contact with the blood of the affected person, injecting drugs, tattoos, piercing, blood-contaminated human levels (toothbrushes, shaving devices), donor blood, a suspicious person with hepatitis and a fetus/neonatal of hepatitis.
(B) for the risk of infection, the group is injecting drug addicts, infected person's sex partners, men who have sex with men, neonatal, sick family and caregivers, blood and other bodily fluids in contact with health, Rescue and police officers and (B) the high incidence of disease in countries visiting passengers.
B It is possible to vaccinate people to prevent hepatitis; In particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk and persons suffering from chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
(B) Other preventive measures against hepatitis are: refraction from the use of foreign hygiene and manicurisation tools, other sharp tools, and syringe needles, tattoos and piercing, and condom use in the event of a dangerous infection, or Prevention of sexual risk behavior.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is a part of the national Immunization plan in Estonia and free of charge for children.
C Hepatitis Viruses spread when you are exposed to blood from a sick person, injecting drugs, tattoos, piercing blood, having a blood-contaminated substance, being a donor, with a person with a Foetus/neonatal.
Hepatitis C infection include injecting drug addicts, infected person's sex partners, men who have sex with men, neonatal, sick family members and caregivers, blood and other bodily fluids in contact with health, Emergency workers and police officers, persons with HIV infection and hepatitis C passengers visiting countries with high incidence of disease.
(C) A preventive measure for hepatitis is: refraction from the use of foreign hygiene and manicurate materials, other sharp tools, and syringe needles, tattoos and piercing, and condom use in the event of a dangerous infection.
C is not a vaccine against hepatitis.
Hepatitis D is caused by hepatitis D virus, which multiplies B in the presence of the hepatitis virus.
Due to this, hepatitis D infection is a combination with hepatitis B or superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread by contact with blood and other body fluids, and to the foetuses contaminated with them, sexually transmitted and rarely infected by a mother.
(D) Chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and those who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive action is a vaccination against hepatitis B vaccine, which protects people from infection with hepatitis D virus.
E hepatitis Viruses pass through the fecal-oral route with drinking water and food, including low heat-treated beef, fish and seaweed eating, donor blood, shared syringes and an infected mother's foetus.
Passengers may become infected by a high incidence of hepatitis E in countries.
(E) Prevention measures for hepatitis are to meet hygiene requirements: wash or disinfecte hands after you go to the toilet, before you are cooking and eating, after sick care.
Fruit and vegetables washed before consumption, avoid low heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and refrain from drug use.
While in the last round, competitors tried to move away from the four-fold Olympic champion, the 34-year-old Farah's ultimate force was found and won by the time of 26.49, 51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling it after the finish along the path with the wife Tania and the kids.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
It was wonderful being on those trails, "said Farah to reporters.
Farah sights the fifth-title race in London in succession to 5000 and 10 000 meters of the golden Duublit.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
In spite of the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor will dive into "the Lady in Gold." A remarkable story of the portrait of Gustav Klimti's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Baueri, 20th century. The beginning of the 20th century.
But even more deeply in history.
Perhaps a tougher crop ax, a narrower topic, would have allowed the title to have a more effective effect on the extraordinary story.
At present, there are two books between the covers of the same cover: The Story of Adele Bloch-Bauer and his painting, "Lady Kullas", and the much larger and more comprehensive history of respectable Jewish families and the German occupation with its In Austria.
The first third of the book leads in the midst of a vibrant Viennese cultural life and who, in his own right, is in the Austrian capital, without the slightest effort to imagine how more than a hundred years ago the life around Ringstrasse went, or how the Central cafe had all the heads turned Klimt walked in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest towns and in the book seeing a familiar name, it's like a gram of cultural.
At the same time, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in the town where the incurable syphilis in Europe was the most high-level European suicide, the story of the development as if something did not provide.
Or maybe, however, each of the odd brush snaps adds the colors 20. The cultural life of the century.
A dream trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the biggest Jewish community in western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost every tenth of Vienna was a Jew.
Also, Adele's parents were newcomers in Vienna, but by the time the Adele got married twice by the Czech sugar tycoon Ferdinand Bloch and klimtile for his famous paintings posed, his father's bank had become the seventh largest bank The Habsburg Empire.
But adelet all this glamorous life he belonged to did not pull.
If you look at the "Lady's Gold", it's hard to believe that, towards the end of life, this noble lady was becoming a socialism and dreaming about a trip to the Soviet Union.
1903. By the time Ferdinand Bloch decided to order the portrait of his wife from Klimtilt, the final moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
At that time, the subscription to KLIMTI paid 4000 eek, a quarter of the well-located country house price.
With a portrait of a Master's love affair with a model, the sugar Magnaati did not.
As far as the reality is concerned, the only thing that has emerged is that the close relationship between a model and an artist created during the work continued for the rest of his life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor-"The Lady in Gold."
The extraordinary tale of Gustav Klimti's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Baueri Portrait ", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before the start of the work, the Rabro had been in a basilica in San Vitale, and the investigators thought that it was just the glorious mosaics of the Empress Theodore, the artist gave the idea of making a golden portrait as a mosaic painted.
Klimt presented its "Lady's Gold" in Vienna 1908. A second golden painting of "Kiss" was born in and around the same time (between 1907-1908).
The art historians did not miss the similarity of the two women.
What about the story related to Hitler?
"I think that to remember my friend Klimti, I owe him a debt to make his handiwork available to the public", wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the Director of Belvedere Museum and wished that their family The Klimti collection would go to the museum.
Six years before his death, the Klimtil had a second portrait of the Adelest.
Also in his will (Adele left February 1925), he asked his wife to leave his two portraits and four Gustav klimti landscape paintings to the Austrian gallery.
His jewellery was inherited by his niece, Maria, Mariale and Luials.
A year after Klimt had completed the "Austrian Mona Lisa", he had tried to get to the Academy of Fine Arts of Vienna 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but fell through the drawing exam.
Although it is sometimes considered that Hitler's subsequent anti-Semitism was not accepted by Jewish professors in the academy, none of his examiners were actually a Jew.
In any case, the Austrian Gallery task of 1939 was cited in Maria's testament. It has become an important year for the creation of the work of the Natsiparya, a rich collection of Jewish art collections.
In Hitler's personal art assets, some of the works at home were also suitable but not of the KLIMTI.
Sixty years after the Nazi art-robbers began a ten-year litigation between the Austrian Government and the Bloch-Bauer heals.
It should be noted at this point that, as the "Kiss" in Vienna, in Belvedere Castle, Adele Bloch-Bauer's "Lady of the Gold" is to be taken to see the Neue Gallery of New York.
And before the Vienna ride, read the aforementioned book.
Even if you're not going to look at Klimti's works, because at least my emotions revolt after the book is closed, more of a Nazi and Jewish theme than a 135 million-dollar-sold painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer around.
Thus, not so much a portrait as if rather a tribe of prey – and a very touching story.
The Bauer family tree in the beginning of the book significantly facilitated the orienteering of the events.
A 17-year-old swimmer in Canada was very close to the Estonian record
In the Preswim, Gold's own 200 m was very close to a personal record, which was very near 2.16, 62.
The top mark dates back to the 17-year-old piweekly time, when the Canadian Junior Championship was in the time of 2.16, 58, brokering Priit Aaviku's swim blog.
Gold was the last to the A-finals.
In the finals he went through the distance of 2.15, 76 and gained a good seventh place with a new mighty top stamp.
The Estonian record of Alina Kendzior (2.15, 13) was to subside the gold for over half a second.
In Estonia, Gold is the third biggest of all time, and its fresh personal top mark is the fifth result of all time in Estonia.
A young hope for the future of the Canadian Adult Championship is still starting at 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in free fall and 200 m-and 400 m complexes.
This past week the Canadian Juniors Championships took place in Toronto, and Gold has made successful starte there as well.
He won 200 in free fall, silver medal with the time of 2.03.
So quickly it was a distance from the Estonian woman last 2008 year.
In Estonia, the Estonian rekordsed Elina Partõka has been all over the times.
In Canada, a bronze medal was won by 100 m in free fall with an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season with the top Mark 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year old, is going to be the distance of just one hundredth of a quarter.
The personal top mark was reached by an additional 100 m in the back of the message in the opening shift at 1.03, 69.
He only reached a seventh position by the longest distance of half in the finals, when he swam to the final of 31.
Gold is currently leading the top of the Estonian season on four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpening their teeth
The time of holiday is in hand-it means relaxing with the US President Donald's drum.
Since Trump has, however, been one of the most holidays out of the president, the critics sharpened their teeth.
The US Today and CNNi message have a 17-day holiday in the in-Town Golf Club at Bedminstein in New jersey.
Although the presidential holiday started yesterday, the Trump has been a holiday on the subject of a week.
They're going to throw down too frequent on the drum.
It is the president's practice to spend a long weekend in the villas of Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump has not been the president of his 196 during their professional days.
For example, George W. Bush reached its time on vacation already 67 days, with Barack Obama but half less than Trump, just 21 days.
However, the drum tends to forget things quickly.
After becoming president, the Trump said "60 Minutes" that long vacations were not going to take time, because there is so much to do.
He also published an indignation of Barack Obama's holiday three years ago.
The current president, on Twitter, wrote back to: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS chopping out the heads of journalists."
White House officials notice there is not a 17-day golf Club visit, exactly a kind of relaxation.
This is officially called a work holiday, during which there is no time for a drum to read or do other activities.
In addition, there was a second reason to be on vacation.
In fact, in the western wing of the White House the air conditioning system is changed and the whole staff had to leave.
The western wing also features an oval Office and other presidential premises.
"I don't think any of you would want to be in the west of August, if there's 38 degrees and no air conditioning," said the White House spokesperson Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the President would continue working during the holidays.
From where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you get an idea of the video.
Block critics from Facebook please do not apply for a state office unless you tolerate criticism by voters
The father of our country knew a lot about a disadvantage from the media.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers didn't take long to begin to bully him for everything from internal politics to his political principles.
Criticism naturally irrited her.
But he didn't force his critics to silenced.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of expression can be taken away from us, and, as a mute and silent, we may be led to carnage as sheep."
It brings me to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who is going to bother to be more like Washington.
The host of Hogan has blocked and erased at least 450 human posts who published their opinion on the official Facebook page.
And at the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) thus appealed to the court.
The governor's department stamped the application as void and the comments were swarwed with reactions in the style of "Who cares?".
"It's just Facebook," said many.
But that counts.
And it matters so much when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an amazingly popular Republican governor, with a predominantly democratic state.
The percentage of its acceptance is the second best ranked among the governor of 50.
Hogan is not an unthinky-reacting fiddled head.
He has led the state on a particular hand, and remains strongly determined by its principles.
In addition, he has used the main tool to communicate with his voters rather than to Facebook, presenting, for example, after the chemotherapy for the first time, his weddly head.
Hence, the Governor's page, which is an official marked public forum, managed by the staff receiving taxpayers ' dollars paid to be blocking unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's spokesman, as he defended Amelia Chasse, in an interview that was given to the Washington post, claiming that the blocking of comments was nothing more than moderating.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of internet trolls, spam or anger-filled people on the web.
The Post was conversed with several real people, whose Hogan was blocking.
And that's exactly what they are, people who interact with their chosen leaders. Teacher, business owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectfull, thoughtful and by no means obscene.
The Pastor quoted the Bible in his post, opting for Hogan's Catholic.
From Maryland, an advocate from Bowie, Lakshmi Sarma Raman, was not incited by anger, but by real hate crimes.
"I've been politely commenting on the disappointment of being disappointed because she hasn't responded to hate crimes, or any recent news," she wrote the news story in The comment.
"Nor do I like the idea that, when a lot of people comment on the same subject, some of them immediately call it indifferently to a collective effort, instead of recognising that there is a large number of worried citizens."
What the governor's department called a "spam attack" would probably call others "public support".
The Facebook era allows you to easily match your messages, simply by blocking a critic or by deleting a negative comment.
It's much more purer than in the old days when they had to send out the workers so that they'd assemble the newspapers with critical editorial and burn them or arrest them and force them to shut down.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official to be criticized for making the Facebook and other social media work teeth.
President Trump has complained to the users of Twitter, who are blocked by his Twitter flow.
One of the first crucial judgments on this subject was made last week in Virginia.
In Alexandrias, US District Judge James C. Cacher decided that the First amendment of the Loudouni County supervisory board was violated by the initial amendment of the Constitution by blocking the voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, he was also visited by Governor Matt Bevinit (R) using the Facebook and Twitter of ACLU.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, affordable postage had a similar impact on the Internet.
In the range 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers was quadrupled, and anonymous writers tricked his way into management.
And even then, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
The people wrote letters to the newspapers like Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, making the decisions of Washington to destroy.
According to historical documents, based on the online George Washington Collection project, his cabinet was buried in petitions, which criticised his views on the friendship, trade and Shipping contracts.
But he didn't make them silenced.
Freedom of expression, dissenting opinions and debates are the foundations of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.

On poverty and death in Indonesia in gold-nut land
If Bardina Degei prepares dinner, he will not use the stove.
He's still using the pot seldom.
In a wooden cabin in Enarotalis, the Latvian capital of the Papua province of Paniai, he puts a housewife in the local language to the place of a sweet potato called "Nota".
After half an hour, the charred mud is taken from the fire and the greyed skin is eager to be eaten.
Tasei sits in mud on the floor with no furniture in it, and there he does his daily chores, for example, washes wash from nearby sex with blurry water.
Its role is filled by a bucket in the roof room.
Since he is the youngest of four women of his wife, he is not destined to take care of any field.
Polygamy is normal here in the mail.
However, working late may be dangerous most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink hard, plus there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to go around the village after five o'clock night," he says.
This is a rare glimpse into the Papua Highlands. It is a former Dutch colony that was merged with Indonesia under 1969. In 2002, the controversy provoked a referendum in which only 1026 elderly were forced into the hands of their troops when raising his hand.
The movement incited the liberation of the Dutch overlordship in the direction of his rage quickly in the hands of the government of Jakarta, which is still holding its strong control, while keeping away from the extra writers and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into papier and western Papua, so that the independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is alike in a distant and deserted place. To get here you must fly from the provincial capital of Jayapurg 90 minutes to Nabius, and then go through a five-hour rental car that takes you to a nauseous drive.
There is no public transport.
With about 19 000 inhabitants, the city consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and cover wavy iron roofs, which rust has transformed into different shades of yellow-brown.
Very few Indonesians have undertaken the journey here, let alone journalists, and have not been here almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the paws of Honey Pago were worshipped by a god named "Tamee".
There were also other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing such clothes," says Degei, referring to his colorful hand-woven turban, dark shirt, and vivid skirt.
"Before that, we only wore plant leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and the statistics of infant mortality and illiteracy are among the worst in Asia.
But it is also the Indonesian gold-barrier land.
Only 100 km from Panama, which is the mountainous province of New Jersey with 153 000 inhabitants, is the largest and most profitable gold mine in Grasberg, which is owned by Freeport McMoRan, a company active in Phoenix.
2015 alone. In 2002, Freeport dug up about 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be braed with utility wood stocks with an estimated value of USD 78 billion.
But these riws are the source of the sufferings of papulates, as they cause the suffoling presence of a powerful Indonesian army.
Newspaper The New York Times 2005. In the study showed that Freeport, between 1998 to 2004, paid local troops and military units about 20 million U.S. dollars, including up to 150 000 US dollars for one officer.
The efforts of the tankers to ensure greater autonomy is threatening this golden goose and are being mercilessly transformed.
Human rights activists said, since 1969. Since 1997, more than 500 000 boats were slaughtered and thousands more have been raped, tortured and captured by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, there was a massive killing of the genocide in the 1970s that took place on the mountainous areas of Papua tribes.
In the last year alone, Indonesia arrested more than 3900 peaceful Proteas in the area of the Indonesian police region.
Birsbane Archdiocese 2016. Annual Report "We lose All" contains testimony of atrocities that have been committed the previous year, such as out-of-court executions, torture (one other report is particularly prevalent rape and electric shocks) and peaceful demonstrations Brutal suppression.
"The number of victims is difficult to count, because such incidents occur every week," says the organization Human Rights Watch Indonesia investigator Andreas Harsono.
The screws are still tighted, as Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but the demography is changing, as the patterns of Indonesia from the crowded Javanese, Kalimantani, Sumatra and Sulawesi Islands come from the muslimies of economic migrants.
Family-friendly and mixed vegetables are sold with crispy fried chicken and "gado-Gado", which are served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants start to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market at a lower cost from local tanks," explained Paniais born 24-year-old Abeth You, who moved to work on behalf of the provincial capital of Jayapurasse.
"The natives of the indigenous to the papuons [women] therefore lose their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is among the people known as Jokowi, promised his 2014. This year's election campaign is to address these inequalities and human rights abuses in the tank.
A former carpenter won on his way to the Jakarta presidential palace in Papua 29 electoral district 27, including Paniai.
But there is very little change in the Papuon, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken, because 2014. We voted for Jokowi by anticipation that he will fulfill our hopes regarding justice restoration, "says You.
In fact, Paniai did not just have two months after his inauguration in the Jokowi October.
2014 of 7 July 2015 The 11th children sang the Christmas songs at the Enarotalis campfire when two Indonesian soldiers showed up from the darkness.
You told them they should turn the headlights on.
According to the local pastor's Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers on their voice and returned later with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, the drunk soldiers chased the children and beat them with the handles of their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers was shot among the children.
One of the children, a 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, was beaten so cruel that he had fallen into a coma.
A few hours later, a nearby electoral building was set on fire, and the next day escalates things further.
About 1000 young Papua men, women and children gathered for justice on the football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows, and they gave Papua Honey Pago tribe Waita-dance, during which the Joost round and the hiker's bird song.
Some protecators started throwing stones at the police and military.
In a exacerpument of outrage, a command was sent to the soldiers through an internal radio. "When the crowd refers more than three times the resistance, let them down," was said, according to a formal document, which has been seen in magazine TIME, but not issued to local media.
In the town of Enarotali the village of Kego Koto District Elder Yeremias Kayame (56) sensed a threatening threat and called for peace to be maintained, asking for a crowd to go home.
Nobody was willing to listen.
"Turning over, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he said to the magazine the TIME of his bright-colored tree house on the porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, great enough to shoot," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw got hit three times by his cousin who saw his shooting.
"I ran up to him and I examined his body, to make sure it was with him," said TIME in synch Yohanes, who uses only one name as many Indonesians.
"I saw that he was dead..." I kissed her. "
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subjects were only returning his precinted security because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if we are threatened to kill us," said 2015. In Papua Police spokesperson Commissar Pudjo Sulistiyo.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and there was plenty of injured.
News about the killings came to Jakartasse the next day.
Three weeks later, the Jokowi Jayapuras had a passionate speech where he had a sympathize with the families of the victims and promised to deal with abuses in the tanker.
"I want to resolve this case immediately, so it will never happen again in the future," he said.
Minister of Security Wiranto said 2016. It established an extrajudicial mechanism for resolving crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately followed apologies.
"Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and in the early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes, "he said.
Magazine Time 5. Speaking of June, Mr Wiranto took his words back, saying that he had no intention of setting up a tanker to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, "Everything is settled by law".
The Wiranto, whom the UN has accused of human rights crimes, in relation to more than 1000 people in East Timor 1999. The year of the bloody's independence referendum, said that 11 anti-human rights crimes have already been solved in the tanker, including the occurrence of Paniais.
The Paniai families took such claims against the grim disbelief.
"I've been questioned four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still going to live scary years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I fear the Army will arrest me, I fear I will be shot."
His brother, Yacobus, assured the opinion that the people of Paniai are afraid to have this incident.
He said he got beaten by the military after he had helped to bury four victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, a shot of the Indonesian police in the villagers paniai in the neighboring regentdom of Deiyais.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when the man went to a war between the head of the villagers and the construction company, who refused to go to the hospital for the unconscious.
This male, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned fish in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers were on a site to protest the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers loosed cops with stones on which the latter responded with the warning shots.
But according to the locals, the Mobile brigade (the Indonesian militarized police) started firing on the crowd, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, afraid of vengeance," said TIME 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injuries.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Parliament of Deiyai has called for the prosecution of police officers and the retraction of policemen's mobile brigade in the region.
Paniai has always been a problem place for the Government of Indonesia.
The lack of meaningful development feeds on the dissatisfaction of those living with honey, Moni, Dan and Damali in the central mountainous countryside.
Many of them are affiliated to the Free Papua Movement (VPL) rebel army which, according to them, protects the papule rights by conducting random attacks and kidnapper raids among Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL drivers come from Panama, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the army has taken a "defence of State sovereignty" on the pretext in the last few years to have captured a banker and have been tampered with by thousands of people.
Some of them will never show up again.
In Papua people, they are known as "the tragic forgotten place".
Poverty nourishes dissatisfaction.
The lack of rice the enarotalis is sold is too expensive to buy for the locals.
The bread is just as unavailable.
People grow their entire food by themselves mainly in Bataati, in addition to some fruit and leafvegetables.
Agricultural cultivation is the work of women, each of which can be cared for in four or five batadist fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest sell to the local market.
The ten Bataati costs only 10 000 Indonesian rupeas (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality has deereded between indigenous tankers and new migrants who have been in a number of years since the opening of new routes at Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist, go to better educated and more prosperous migrants.
The tanks themselves often lack capital or skills necessary for the competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in visiting, because there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the chairman of the Panius Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes away from the tank.
In addition, restrictions on foreign media remain tough.
At the beginning of this year, the French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from the tanker, because they had not watched the relevant practices, although they had been given a rare film permit.
Phelim Kine, deputy head of the Human Rights Watch, Department of Asian Affairs, has not implemented the Jokowi electoral commitment to abolish the restrictions on the reports in promoting transparency and development.
"In Indonesia, the most easternest provinces of Papua and the west of the papules trying to make reports to journalists are threatening new threats of visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The absence of a glance of the press of the media in the media means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua closest neighbours.
In March, the six Pacific countries, the United States of Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall and Solomon Islands, spat the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "a wide range of large-scale crimes" in Paapuas, including the shooting of Paniai.
The same countries have historically supported VPL.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, threw the grouping's allegations aside, saying to the journalists: "There is still a democratic order in Indonesia and freedom of the press, so that the crimes against human rights The evidence would be hard to bury. "
Local people want more foreign governments to pay attention.
When the Dutch official delegation was headed by the National Ambassador of Human Rights on 4. On May, the local people interrupted the meeting, but according to the source wished to remain anonymous, it strongly urges: "We want freedom."
In Indonesia, 2019 is held. The new presidential elections were held in 2005, but the Papuons did not believe that they would revote by Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but surrounded by people who are involved with the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, chairman of the Council of the tribes.
He wants to give jokowile the understanding that in addition to the fact that the people of Paniai are constantly living under the threat of a predator military, they are suffering from the poor in the misery of education and health services.
In Gobai's words, the people of Paniai, like the rest of the papuls, are required to have the voice of their jokowile in debt, which he must pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidance, Paniai became the families of the firing victims, and they buried a victim in the land opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that you never have to put justice on the back, they do not at least allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus, handed down.
"What else can we do?"
Had swallowed a skyscraper of Dubai's tower for the second time.
He went through one of the world's tallest housing towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of inhabitants from the height of 337 m and 79 to flee the building.
It's another fire that's been devastated by a high-ranking thing in two years, sometimes called the "Torchia" Torchtor Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injury was reported and no immediate cause of fire was presented.
"We slept and we woke up a fire alarm and screaming people.
We ran down the stairs and took 50. About 10 minutes to get down, "said a resident of Reuterss, who called himself George.
According to the Dubai civil defence officials, the firefighters erased the flame about 4 a.m. at the local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working for the victims to secure shelter.
This incident may again raise questions about the safety of materials used around the world on high-ground surface.
Torch Board 2015. During the investigation carried out after the year of fire, it was found that the most damage was suffered by the façade, decorative panels and insulation of the exterior surface.
The UK police have stated that they believe that the "Grenfell tower isolation and façade panels" of London could have contributed to the rapid spread of the June-a fire, which killed around 80 people.

They were in separate rooms at the ESPN office, until Garcia, the invincible World Boxing Councili light Champion, walked onto the other end to greet Lomachenko, a badweight champion of World Boxing organization.
After a unanimous decision by Garcia for the former world champion Adrien Broner over Saturday, Showtime, both fighters are part of the top of the weight table.
Garcia handed his right hand and said, "How are you doing, champ?
Wish you luck. "

And his must move upwards of lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fans have wanted it.
Then let them have it. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing world needs this fight."
The question is whether to view it should be chargeable.

Which of the world's corners are moved to Estonia?
Last year, the police and Border Guard Board (PPA) had more than 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have traveled to Estonia for work, study or family life.
If, for example, last year it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit issued 6702 to an alien, it was the number 4928.
Authorities cannot tell how many immigrants will permanently remain in Estonia, but this analysis is made at the internal ministry.
When ten years ago there were around 500 ukrain in Estonia, this figure will start to reach close to 2000 in recent years.
The number of applicants for a residence card increased exponentially during the Ukraine crisis-2014. It received a temporary residence 1087 people, a year earlier 675.
In Estonia, the statistical office has the largest number of Ukrainian citizens, last year arrived in Estonia 850 Ukrainian citizens more than left.
"The Ukrainian community has been great all the time in Estonia, and due to the difficult circumstances of the country it is natural that the work and learning opportunities are sought from the country where the community and many of the family already faced" were acknowledged by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, spokesman Kristin Rammus.
Last year, the number of Ukrain persons, which had received a temporary residence permit, was even greater than the number of Russian citizens, although in the ten years the total amount of fixed-term residence permits were issued to the latter.
When Ukrainians come to work predominantly, Russian citizens for their family migration.
"Given this historic Russian community, they are more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia," says Helina maasing.
"If you look at where the citizens of Russia who have received the residence permit in Estonia have moved away, then there is an immediate Ida-Virumaa", he added, and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married the citizen of the European Union.
Last year, he received a temporary residence permit of 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record-breaking number.
At the same time the residence permit to extend wished the Russians had fallen.
"There is a jump due to the fact that a new residence permit has been applied for permanently to Estonia instead of the renewal of the residence permit", explained the spokesman of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Rammus, who said that the interest of Russian citizens against Estonia's residence permit has remained rather stable for many years .
Aliens who have resided here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit to stay permanently in Estonia.
It is designed to encourage the adaptation of people who have settled here.
For example, a long-term resident's residence permit requires five years.
A new residence permit has probably also diminished the old residence permit extension.
Last year, for example, this residence permit was given to a 146 Ukrainian person who has worked here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians will be able to change jobs and the Estonian state will no longer have a point of pointing out whether the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit was made popular by boom-applicant last year's still grey passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigeria (36).
In total, there was a residence permit of 1968 people for the purpose of settling in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Grusin and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, a country whose citizens are one of the most active residents of Estonia has become surprising.
than 2007. Three residence permits were issued to Nigeria, then last year 200.
Nigeria is coming to study in the universities here.
The higher education institutions in Estonia are popular, for example, among Georgian, Chinese and Turkish.
The number of citizens in India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen predominantly due to the study families.
Also in these cases, the rule that where a community has been created will be more easily accessed by others ", added Rammus.
In 10 years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 South Korea, 40 Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If a year gets a residence permit of about 6000 third country nationals, then this is about 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even if you think of EU citizens, migration remains at about a percentage ", commented maasing, in fact, the numbers are small.
In total, according to the Statistical office, last year 14 822 people migrated to Estonia, with the exception of 13 792.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year's emigration.
Most of the field and the enmovers are Estonian citizens, but more are among the deceased.
Therefore, the immigration of Estonian citizens was in the disadvantage of 2000 people.
Estonians migrate in particular between Finland and Estonia.
The Mammu Couture Princess Fashion is charming with SATs, embroidery and a bully
However, the Nordic Ideedelaegas is the history-old paintings and costumes for the Maria Tammeoru, "I can for hours in the museum and dream of old fashioned sleeves and crabs.
You do something with passion, you investigate and learn about it every day.
It's the joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu couture may seem unreal, but the designer does not think so.
You decide how much shine you have in your life!
I got a friend who's got a whole sauna full of the haute couture dresses I created.
Because it's not his fault that he's not living in Hollywood, and he doesn't go to the red carpet every day, and he wants to wear those most beautiful dresses and he does!
You can live your life special!
The fashion designer does not recognize the gap between shining events and the daily routines of Grey.
This is precisely what led to the plan to bring the high fashion in Estonia to the countryside, between forests and fields, to the people that they often do not get.
The Mammu collection was presented for example in Võru, Jõhvi and the fashion alleles of Pärnu, where the 45 royal Defilee was filled with the whole street.
Tallinn is often hung in, nodding with dignity, but elsewhere emotions are more-shouting braavo, rising up, wanting to thank you for your hand.
A large part of the audience just came in to the news, but now they're Mammu couture fans.
If you cross people's expectations, they will be delighted!
And I like the feeling that I'm on the summer tour with my fashion creations.
In Pärnu, we had 50 feet of red carpet, a full street of beautiful dresses, seemed to have no end!
Maria also does not testify that the creations must be presented as a supermodel to the SuperSale, and willingly brings the stage to ordinary women.
I often ask my own clients to the stage-they're always happy to come.
It's such an amazing experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my show before, and I'm always backstage to give a hopeless, perfectionist stuff like this.
My nerve wouldn't allow me to watch in peace.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who doesn't want to fill a representative role, but to be inside everything.
I've got my own sewing machine in the studio, and I'm doing the most of the collection myself.
I like the whole process where you play details, Discover.
I'm never far from my work, and I'm not afraid of a job.
The design is not limited to stylistics, logistics, organizing, organizing-everything has to fit into one of the temperament of the woman's Day.
Well, those fanatics are going to be huge.
I can't tell you when my workday ends, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I'm still very lucky--it's like an unending chain of luck: I do something nice, a person gets something beautiful, and yet in turn compliments.
How many times have they said that there's magic in my dresses-they make themselves known as a princess.
The most abundant of tulle lines that were making Maria talent overnight, the Mammu couture signature remains until today.
Martin Müürsepp U18 Boys: The Estonian group tournament was now being rotated against us
Sorry, the fairytale ran out.
The first thing was in the eye that we didn't get our table.
And if there's such a big difference in the table, there's nothing to do ', commented on the U18 of Estonian basketball Boys ' 61:75 to the Great Britain, our only Nbas played basketball player, BC Kalev/Cramo abitcoach Martin Müürsepp.
Opponents took a 28 ball from the offensive table and received so many more attacks.
We were also not ready for their aggressive defence or attack, it created.
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build up protection.
But in defense, they were able to keep their hands everywhere, we couldn't combine.
It created a team from under his feet.
The opponents homework was better done.
According to the Masons, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to kill the adversaries at the roots.
In the last quarter-we had a zero error, but opponents already have several quick baskets.
The athletic, and the dense upsurge that was our weapon in the subgroup tournament, turned everything against us now.
Today we didn't have the strength against their aggresctivity.
The Mason was left in kaleering with his ward, with Matthias Cup alone.
The tournament will generally be able to say good words to the entire team.
It's a shame you've already been met with an aggressive adversologist.
The cup has always been confident and played out today, but it felt like he was tired-he's worn a pretty big burden.
But he did some really nice moves I've seen in the past......
Terrible numbers: The girls ' basketball team in the EM tournament scored less than 10 points with three quarters...

Perhaps almost half an hour, 47 was hit by one.
In addition, there were 2 points in four free throts.
The ball loss was a reasonable figure in the time, 12.
At the end of the game was Polish throwing hit 33 and in Estonia 13 percent (68/9).

During the visit, the vessels are preparing to sea naasimiseks and give the team members the opportunity to make a unique holiday.
After a visit, NATO ships remain in Estonian waters to carry out a series of exercises and be prepared for future search for historical explosives.

From 29 May. As of June, NATO will lead The permanent mine clearance group, Latvian Navy commander, Lieutenant Gvido Laudups, who took over the functions of a group commander at a ceremony in Riga from the Estonian Navy officer, Captain Lieutenant Johan-Elias, from the back of the country.

4.-13. In August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery are reconsidered to be a place where 13 years ago the Birgitta Festival, which was implemented by Maestro Eri's class, was held down.
This year's Birgitta Festival becomes a beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to Risto Joosti (36), the artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic Orchestra.
Risto Joost: "Traviata" and "Tosca" are the classics of the opera world, ballet performances from the enchanting "bolerost" with amusing "Karlsson" and the scheme does not lack the self-production, which is the occasion of Joseph Haydni's Wonderful oratorio " The seasons "production by the same international creative team who 2015. In 2005, Pirita brought to the scene of Haydni's "creation" of a masterpiece.
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre productions.
It's bigger than any music theatre in its traditional form.
It's a festival the enchantment of which takes over and will never go unfairly.
Because the experience that the listener receives in this superior and mysterious environment makes the human souls sound and touches the human brain in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, the first year you are the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival.
Didn't the maestro's shoes have looked a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with a different class, it's been a lot of help.
He directed me through my entire student career and also supported the early conducting.
Maybe that's why it's easier for me to continue her work.
The special Klas has injected the Birgitta Festival team with so many goodness and naturally it is all over me.
It was great to join the team, who knows how to do things exactly.
The great heart of the Eri, which also gave me the strength to take on the festival in the Tallinn Philharmonic, was very strong.
And here I am now and I can do it!
What could the audience in this year's festival Excitate what special you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and as a surprise you will have to give the first ballet, which is written on the story of Astrid Lindgren.
That's why Karlsson flies.
And one of the most notorious nuances of it is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed the desire to write this book.
Apparently, he's been living the character of Karlsson in his life since childhood.
Risto, how do you know all this stuff?
Thanks to my supportive partner for sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I'm fortunate enough.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions are not so dependent on many people, as far as I am, how am I going to fight every new day.
And that conscious toning, keeping positive and actually smiling at yourself in the mirror of the morning, significantly lifted my lucky percentage.
Especially now this week, when there are the most important samples, I have practiced it very well, and it works.
Smiling at yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a word.
I think people still don't know the half of their body that the universe is offering them, but it's just that they're going to discover it slowly.
Right now, the moment has come.
Do you have a ritual before you step into the conductor remote?
There's still clothes to be exchanged for more comfortable.
It's that little moment to yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest or have a little nap before the big audition.
In fact, I even like to actively communicate with people, even before stepping into the conductor's remote.
But come to the Birgitta Festival, here you have to discover not much of a great opera and ballet friend!
Watch the spirited video of Risto Joost!
New results from the age evaluation tests for Swedish asylum seekers were published
In Sweden a test was carried out among the asylum seekers, during which a new approach to their age was assessed medically. The latest results from the test show that more than 80 percent of the institutions were evaluated as older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started the tests at the beginning of this year.
Tests were set up to further evaluate the age of an asylum application after the Swedish Migration Office (Migrationsverket) was criticized for not having succeeded in correctly determining the age of several allegedly minors refugees.
Today, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases and the Institute of Forensic Medicine is between 2017. From mid-March to 31 December 2004; The total 2481 test results were issued by July.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed at 18 years of age or older, and in 25 other cases the Institute of Forensic Medicine assessed that the test "could be 18 years of age or older".
432 in this case, it was concluded that a person was "expected to be younger than 18".
Tests will be used only when the age of a person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson, a forensics institute, the results are consistent with the previous months.
"We don't see much difference between previous month's statistics, the numbers are fairly consistent," he said to The Local newspaper.
The fact that a large proportion of cases have been assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
In May 581 the institute issued the test results and said that 442 "there is a reference to the fact that the person to be investigated is 18 years of age or older".
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet explored their 581 test results, it was found that 243 the case was a man directly claimed to be this year 18.
This medical age-estimation method, during which x-rays of the wisdom teeth and the knee-joint MRI are carried out, after which they are allowed to analyse dentistry and radiologists, have been criticised in some circles.
One of the sceptics is the Karolinska Institute's endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose duties include the evaluation of human biological maturity to determine whether they passed through puberty sooner or later.
"I have had reason to think about it and I do not think that the method of measurement currently in use should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, then we shouldn't make a face that we can, "he said to the newspaper Metro.
However, Johan Göransson of the Forensic Institute defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, the risk of the child being immature is low.
The largest, or about 10%, is at risk in case the person is just under 18. "

Coe accepted the Russians ' honest apology for the Dopinguskandahl
The international athletics-in-law Sebastian Coe, according to his words, said "Russian Thursday's honest apology" for the Dopinguskandahl, but reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country to return to sport.
Russia athletics Rhino Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the world Championships in athletics that his state's ban on competition is correct and has a certain purpose in the fight against doping.
He apologized to "all athletics in which gold and silver medals are being snatsed."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of leaving the ban in force, which was imposed on 2015. In November, after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought this was a very honest answer, very fair presentation," said the IAAF president Coe's journalists.
"The entire council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation also acknowledged that they have had rather complicated times and they will make the federation's restructuring all possible."
In addition to the Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria of his reinstatement.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and that there was progress, but that Congress supports the Working Party's suggestion that this is not the time to undo Russia," said Coe.
"We must do everything we could to normalize the situation within the next few months."
We have always guided the principle that we want to extract pure athletes from the corrupted system, "he added.
Nineteen athletic athletics who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF compete on Friday in the world Championship of athletics as neutral athletes in London.
Rune Andersen, director of the IAAF group, said Monday that Russia does not yet meet the criteria for several retries.
After a presentation to the Council of IAAF, he said to the journalists in London that the doping control is still inadequate and the coaches who have been banned are still free.
The revolution of electric cars significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
There is little that the revolution in electric cars makes everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, and it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say that they win in one place and lose the other, the smaller mining companies won't help.
At present, Glencore serves coal and oil, but in the era of electric cars it grows in cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel demand.
This year, the Governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway have raised the stakes in terms of the distribution of electric cars, allowing the next decades to ban the sale of fossil fuel-using new cars.
The Sestap already has Volvo's knowledge that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine, and Tesla brings to the market a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance is projected to sell cars with more than oil-produced fuels for over two decades.
"It changes everything for some metals," said the Capital economiths ' raw material analyst, Simona Gambranini Bloomberg.
We have already seen a large impact on such metals as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has grown for years.
The electric car is about three times more copper than in a normal car, reported by Glencore.
More copper is needed at charging stations, so Exane's BNP Paribasi estimates increases 2025. By the year, the copper demand for about five percent.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese requirements.
The Glencore proceeds from the growing electric car trend for the price of copper and is the world's largest cobalt producer, the Jefferies Group forecasts.
According to this brokerage company, the winner of the electric car race is Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market responds to a changing trend.
On the London metal stock, cobalt is 70 percent.
The last price increase was 37 percent.
Copper is also this year's callined 14 percent, mainly due to growth.
The Glencore share rose by 20 percent in London after the price rise, with rival Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo Americani.
The losing side is a pleague dealing with companies such as Recyclex and Campine, who need to adapt to a new era.
The main end use of lead is for gasoline and diesel car starters to provide flow-through batteries.
Electric cars use lithium ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead unless another purpose is found to overcome the decline in demand", said Bank of America Merrill Lynchi Metal market analyst Michael Widmer.
The effect of lead in the price movement is not yet seen in the effects of the unrolling trend.
The lead has this year been caled by 17 percent, with it being the best metal among the main industrial metals in London.
For the future, investors can see the problems on metal.
"I'm not sure it's so bad for lead because cheap oil keeps the conventional cars", said a metal brokerage firm, Triland Metal Sales Manager, Herwig Schmidt.
If lead demand falls, it will take place slowly.
Maybe it will happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, more stringent emission standards have been developed to increase the demand for hybrid cars, which depends on the frequent start-up of engine-based batteries, the international lead and Zinc research organisation shall evaluate.
Light metals such as aluminum replace steel, because the lighter car can drive a less electric ride further.
This is explained by an additional 1.6 million tonnes of minimum demand, which is already 2013-2016 years.
It accounts for 2.7 percent of aluminum in the world's total production.
Probably this trend worsens, said Widmer.
Aluminum this year has been called by 13 percent due to the growing demand by car manufacturers to have lead to market deficits.
Steelmakers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding cooperates with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of mammalian car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe will endeavour to develop a lighter alloy steel to resist the minimum.
"High-strength steel should be the answer to this development", said Exane BNP Paribasi analyst Sylvain Brunet.
Some progress is being made in Europe.
The end of the oil era can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, it took about half that of precious metal diesel cars as catalysts, reported by metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"Many of the currently high demand for raw materials such as oil and platinum may not be of high demand in the future", said Bernard Dahdah, Natixis's raw material analyst.
This does not mean that the raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance changes over 15 years.
Platinum producers believe the continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore's head, Marc Grynberg, said 2025. More hybrid cars will continue to be sold in the year.
The great hope of platinum producers in the 10-year run is the Toyota motors and Hyundai Motocars, developed by hydrogen, based on platinum, to produce electricity from hydrogen.
However, this technology has not yet been commercially legitimate.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the way to electric cars", said Exane BNP Paribasist Brunet.
German car producers became a major setout in July, since the Court of Stuttgart banned the use of diesel in the home town of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football rules affect the transition of Neymar into Paris
The rules aimed at anticipating the unmanaged spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from a world-class transition from the Spanish football club to Barcelona-Saint Germain, France.
Any consequences for the UEFA, the governing body which prevails in the European game and which are in the power to deny the teams attending the prestigious Champions League tournament, Paris Saint-Germain is still waiting.
UEFA 2011. Established in fair-game Financial Rules (FFP), the PSG must sometime demonstrate that the transfer of Neymar was funded without a huge loss.
To Barcelona, 222 million were paid (262 million) just because the Brazilian bought her out of the contract, and Neymar's salary begins to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
There are some financial aspects of Neymari to the French club.
The PSG will undoubtedly be able to develop the money to recruit Neymari and add her to the star-threatening lineup, given that the team is financed by the family of the Katari energy crisis.
Clubs are allowed to spend plenty on the recruitment of players, but they must balance this with legal sources of income that allow them to come out of the football business.
FFP put Michel Platini after he was elected 2007. It was the president of UEFA.
This former French player believed that the clubs, who would fall to success in their search for large debts, were actually dealing with cheating and risking the devastation if the banks or owners had to abandon their support.
From 2011. From 2001, FFP focuses on the monitoring of their losses instead of debts to clubs.
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich was first 2003. In Chelsea's-buy a potential club and then make great spending to make the team better and global trademark creation-is harder to implement.
FFP over the current three-year evaluation period, which lasts until 2018. The clubs may incur losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini was rearrested 2015. In a disgrace of the presidential office, his successor to the UEFA, Alexander Ceferin, is still committed to hinting excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules," said the Associated to the press Andrea Traverso, who is a UEFA (FFP supervisor).
Although the PSG paid an overbuying clause to a single payment, it is possible for them to subdivide that amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract, making it possible to show a transitional fee of EUR 44.4, 5 million over the next five years.
The first wave of sanctions for FFP 2014. In 2002, PSG received the most severe punishments with Manchester city, together with Abu Dhabile.
A fine of 60 million (at that time 82 million dollars) was imposed on PSG, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the siege of the Champions League team to a club was requested 2014-2015. In season 21 player is in the normal 25 instead.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to outsmart the regulatory financial institutions by blowing their incomes up through the companies related to the club's owners.
Qatar's company may sponsor the PSG, but if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market rates, UEFA will not be able to take this into account for official income.
So happened 2014. In 1997, when UEFA's decision to support the Qatar Tourism authority PSG was
It is said that a certain part of Neymari PSG service may come 2022. Through the World championship Committee of the years, through the payments from Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become the World Cup ambassador, and claim that the UEFA regulators would be able to expose such maneuvers easily.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilaner in relation to any attempts to disobey the rules.
On Thursday, the people familiar with the situation said that UEFA has not been discussing the transition of Neymar with PSG.
They talked about the Associated presses provided that they are guaranteed anonymity because they are not allowed to discuss the situation in PSG.
Recently published reports show that PSG earned 2015-2016. In 2005, more than EUR 10 million was profit in the amount of approximately 542.4 million turnover.
Data for the last fiscal year have not yet been published.
PSG expects that the arrival of Neymar is well suited for sponsorship transactions, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase of at least 30% in terms of contract conclusion.
The Spanish league, clearly being upset by the departure of one of the greatest football stars... tried to discourage Neymar from the transition by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"This is a clear" financial doping "case with the club and the state," said La Liga President Javier Tebas, Spanish newspaper AS, pointing out that the PSG mainly belongs to Qatar.
The Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports Magnatus, agrees with the La Liga that the state finances the club.
"This is the consequence of property rights and has completely transformed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, since the State may have other ways or interests that such a great player would represent the state. "

Everything was dark and ragises, like the end of the world.
The roof already flew out of the houses, resembled 2002. In the old Lady Linda Kurova Haapsalu, Estonia's nature in an interview.
Linda's husband saw her planted in a garden collapsed.
But what are you going to do with your hands-on, where do you get against such a storm?
The sea came under the window, the water splashed up in Haapsalu and was spoken by Mrs. Linda Toona on Kalda Street.
That the roads were full of trees and the roof of apron on the railway station had been flown 20-30 metres away, Linda saw most of Haapsalu in the same way the next morning.
According to the locals, Paralepa was behind the trees in the lobe on the ground, some completely lying down, a few halves.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went through the beautiful old trees with Ragina and Pragina, like the war.
Lääne-Virumaa could not be 1967. In August 2005, compared to western Estonia, the losses were very serious, but the damage was large, written by Virumaa Teataja 2007. In.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were wiped out of the land of the Earth, but the parks of our Kandi were also heavily harmed.
In Tallinn, the wind speed was measured up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometres per hour.
In Tallinn, Merivälja was the evening of 6 August, one little girl cried, mother, mother!
Chickens are airborne and can no longer download! "", written by Virumaa Teataja
The house of Põll Manor in Viljandi County was destroyed in a storm of time, so it was decided later to Dismanish.
He did not accept the constructions of Türi Ski Hill which had not subsequently been restored.
Newspaper Red Star wrote 12. August 1967. In order to clean up the cities and towns and their puts are progressing slowly, and the inhabitants would be able to participate in cleaning.
In the storm, the crops were damaged too, and the newspaper reported that "party-based organisations must be an inspiration and a direction for both the retorts and the harvest."
Hurricans can be talked about when the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The outbreak of gusts in Estonia remains on the 2nd From November 1969. Of the year, when it measured the wind speed at 48 m/s in the Ruhnul.
The Vaindloo on the island shamed the gauge, so the high wind speed could not be accurately recorded.
Secret of clean bathing areas: night cleaning and poor beach weather
The colder summer weather also means less cleaning in Tallinn's bathing areas.
"If there's no people on the beach, and if they're not, there's no people," it's a beach jantman.
North Tallinn's Stroomi Beach is screaming on the gulls.
For them, melodious competition is offered by the low-reds with a high-speed tractor, which plait stripes on the ground.
In fact, the latter crosses the sand through seven centimeters deep, picking out marine litter and the deserted Risu: bottle caps, cigarette frogs and more.
People are still coming to the beach, no matter if the water is warm or not.
If there is a beautiful weather, there are people on the beach, and if not, there are no people, "says Haabersti management of the beach Koristustworks manager Aleksandr Usov.
It's 6.30 and the beach is going to be a bitter cleaning job, because at 8:00 there must be people in order.
Usov's on the job since 4:00.
After Stroomi he is still keeping an eye on the beach of Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Paljasaare.
The quantities of garbage have decreased.
Many more years ago.
People are now able to appreciate what they're doing for them, "says Usov, who has harvested the beaches for 15 years.
Before it was, when something new was set up, it was a broken next day.
Now you keep what's on the beach.
Price for Clean beach
One of the biggest works in the beaches of Estonia is to clean the sea trash or the seaweed.
For example, on the beach of Pirita it is necessary to transport 400 000 tonnes on the beach season.
"It's an incredible amount," notes Usov.
Another large category is a household garbage, all of which people leave behind.
There are eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week in the Stroomi beachside bar.
So much comes in the garbage.
However, the colder summer weather has meant that the garbage is one fifth less than otherwise.
The third species consists of abandoned things.
Mostly they're kids.
This is the same as the Usov has shoveling out the sand from the inside.
These remain the owners of the wooden path waiting for the beach.
"They usually look more, but it's a normal harvest." Usov already knows that soon he will find them inside the sand.
Kids come to the beach and take toys to sink them in the sand again.
The garbage is torn apart
Mr. Haabersti's administrative representative, Erika Scholler, acknowledges that the sieving operations of the tractor disrupt the local.
Noise that lasts from night to early morning interferes with the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
On the day, this work is impossible.
The beach must be siparate twice in a month.
"If we don't, the district is going to fine us," notes Scholler.
But the goal is, like Pirita, a long herd and a wuss, also get the Stroomi Rand under the quality label of the international Blue Flag.
"There is a lot more work compared to Europe in Estonia that the beaches are maintained", says Scholler.
We have more seaweed and rocks and harder sand to parse.
But there are less garbage on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
When we hear that garbage is spoken on the beach, lively Martin, who is near the beach, walks to a journalist and cleaning staff chat, highlighting the current bottlenecks in the beach.
There's a disgusting picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle-pickers that have pulled garbage bags upside down, says Martin.
Although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their existing behaviours, Martin hopes that the city government will do something for the dumpmen and put them on the covers for example, to prevent at least the birds from being on the go.
In general, Martin is still happy with Stroomi beach development.
It is seen that the city will take care of it.
With children's fields, enlightened and freshly surfaced roads, it has become more pleasant.
It used to be like the roller skates only got one road, and Martin.
Treasure Hunt findings in Stromis: coins, only coins
The morning of the period has come to take advantage of the 40-year-old Dimitri, who is the treasure-hunter to comb the coastline with a metal detector.
He doesn't think there's anything precious today or in the future.
The naval gods are not generous enough.
"I've been doing this for a year, and yet nothing valuable has been found", says Dmitri.
The Hobby Hunter is a Dmitri in a treasure bag, some euro coins, bottle caps, and also a dangerous nails, which later throws into the trash.

Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25% at
The Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates remain at the previous level, since the growth of powerless and inflation has dampened speculation regarding the rise.
Bank of England has warned that growth will remain slutgish, as households ' incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers voted to 6:2 rates at 0.25% and fewer members would demand this month rise, as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly report on inflation, bank 2017 cut. The growth forecast for the year was 1.7% and 2018. The year was 1.6% and warned that the pressures on household incomes persisting, as the inflation in the autumn is still expected to be close to 3%.
At the same time, the bank signalled that the increase in rates is useful for the control of inflation in the next few years, and that the rise in financial markets may require a higher increase in the expected credit costs.
They also voted a year ago by the partial readmission of the "Mammux" package, which resulted in Brexit.
In February, the bank completes a fixed-term financing scheme that offers banks a low-cost facility, although it said that it is now expected to have an increase of £15 billion in the framework of this scheme, which is 115 billion.
In the minutes of the set decision, the bank says: "MPC the central projections of gross domestic product (GDP) will remain unpowering in the near future, as the difficult income situation of households with real incomes continues to exert an impact on consumption."
The rates were reiterated for the need for "pulling some effort into monetary policy" and "somewhat higher" when markets are expected to alleviate inflation.
The exchange is currently predicts a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a second increase in the year 2020.
However, the bank stressed that all kinds of jumps are staged and limited.
The bank's reduced growth forecasts for the purpose and for the following year are comparable to the May projections 1.9% and 1.7%.
2018 the increase in 1.8% was maintained.
After that new, the pound rate was dropped against the dollar and the euro.
The pound decreased 0.5% to 1.31 U.S. dollars and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures, which have damped increasing hopes of rising GDP in the second quarter from 0.2% to 0.3% over the previous three months.
The bank says that the increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be a slight boost at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to rejot the households experiencing rising inflation and miserable salary increases, saying that the situation was going to go a bit worse before it could heal.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent the impact of incomes in the next couple of years, but towards the end of the three-year forecast is expected to have a significant wage recovery.
Because of the weak pounds, the economy also encourages a growing demand for British production, which partly compensates for lower consumer spending.
The decision will come in a year after the rates were taken in August 0.25% after the shocking EU referendum, which caused the sudden weakening of the nail.
According to the bank, it is likely that four years will take the whole life of the prices and economy to be blown.
Before the last decision of the bank, there was a growing demand for increasing the rate, as inflation had increased the pressure on the households in distress; In July, the three policy makers demanded an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell by 2.6% in the previous month compared to June 2.9%, although the bank indicated it was expected, and the rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that the excessive increase compared to the 2 percent objective was due to a completely weak nail.
Coreco's head of mortgage brokers Andrew Montlake said: "The recent decline in exchange rates appears to be again becoming more competitive in the mortgage market, as lenders are yearing to work and expect to finish the year positively.
The exchange appears to be particularly attractive to those whose existing transactions are going to complete as refinancing, often without fees and low rates, has become increasingly popular. "
The NHS is writing 10 000 people out of the conflict that caused the HIV drug
In patients, since September, access to "transformative" HIV prevention therapies after the Supreme Court had been deducted from whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England reported that National health care now makes an estimated 10 000 of an exposure to pre-treatment prophylaxis (PrEP)-a tablet that is administered prior to intercourse and which has shown high risk The risk of infection in humans is approximately 86%.
The NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after the appellate court supported the court's last year's decision according to which NHS is capable of performing PrEP, regardless of its own statements, that the medicinal product should be financed by local Authorities.
The NHS England CEO Simon Stevens welcomed it as a "new comprehensive intervention" on Thursday, while the state aids Fund (NAT) described it as a "landmark moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first people to register... More clinics are added in October before the program 2018. It is deployed in England by April 2015.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medicines taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of infection to HIV.
Results from clinical trials indicate that the PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV to people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there is a sufficient amount of certain medicines in the body that prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines may be taken daily or not later than two hours before intercourse.
Suitable candidates for treatment include homosexual or bisexual males, transgender people and people whose partners are infected and unable to treat HIV.
Clinics identify suitable people who are willing to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-seeking partner cannot receive antiretroviral therapy.
People living in England and who have chosen to receive a family doctor there will also be able to register their participation in the local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The program costs £10 million and NHS England has signed a contract to get medicines this week after international procurement is served.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of the intended use and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new comprehensive intervention should complement and amplibe the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV proliferation.
This is another milestone for more than three decades to fight one of mankind's biggest health issues. "
Deborah Gold, director of NAT, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when it is target correctly for those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers the possibility to change the HIV epidemic in England.
From September, people with a large HIV risk through this NHS in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and is independent of negotiation with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We welcome this announcement warmly. "
The CEO of Terrence Higginsi, Ian Green, said: "It is now essential to ensure that a clinical trial of the country is rapidly kicked off and that no one at risk of HIV can be circumvented.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial Medicine has been obtained, we are on our way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of infection to HIV.
Public Health Shadow Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of a clinical trial in PrEP is very much appreciated and hard overdue after months of delays and the government's feet dragging.
The evidence shows how major changes can bring about HIV prevention and the protermination of its life-altering infection.
This clinical trial takes us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that clinical testing is carried out as quickly as possible in order to protect people who have exposure to HIV and lead us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society. "

The living space of a higher life-half-floor and smart designers have made the room of this small Earls Court apartment
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate estate broker, has traded his great Knightsbridge home 2014. In Earls Court against the apartment.
It is located on the ground floor of Queen Anne Terrace and that Joanne has not packed his bags and sold the apartment, a tribute to a new design.
"Before that I lived with a former partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and I made the same day offer. "
Starting from the first visit, this 93 square-metre apartment has undergone complete renovation.
In the beginning, it was a single bedroom and a sophisticated layout to reach the apartment-bedroom had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add to the storage room and the half-storey to use the high ceilings.
"I wished high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands, "he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi at Notting Hill, an architectural and design studio that operated Duck & Shed in order to take advantage of 3.8 m heights and create a home that is not just a development object, but a place where Joanne can live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces on top of each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a semi-floor where we could stand up.
Erfan had to approach the thing creatively.
"The metal structure is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms, so they'd be on top of each other without bending.
It was not simply the construction of a platform, but we used steel construction so that the height of the upper and lower rooms would be right. "
This placement allowed Erphanil to create two rooms, complete with dramatic elements, in a room, at the same time.
The half-floor opens into an old fashioned, glamorous light on the glamour living below the view of the Retrouvius window.
With the mirror surface, the golden furniture, silver details and the retrofitting Serge Mouille Illuminator emphasize the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatricus, space and luminosity.
Mirrors are attached to both ends of the short corridor to make it look taller.
In the kitchen the rear wall of the mirror leaves the impression of the other room.
At the entrance, the mirror office offers a storage place for all Joanne's cooking utensils and glass requirements.
A living room adds to the charm the opportunity to close the kitchen part when not in use, creating the imagination of a more glamorous space.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
However, this kitchen has a unique fact that it is a type of garage retrait.
"There was a bit of design effort," explains the Erfan door with steel veneered MDF.
"It has a counterweight, so it slides very easily when it's pushed up."
With the use of a space and a storage area, Joanne now has 16 extra meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"After all, the floor surface is what you're selling – or what gives the property a value," says Erfan.
"Realtor steps in an outdated form to the room and makes calculations based on the floor area."
Here they have managed to increase the floor area using quality materials, which add to the space the luxury of the room.
"The materials are the ones you touch and that help create an emotional bond with home," says Erfan.
"You're not in love with electrical wiring in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the heart's tongues ring. "
It shows that a good design and magnified area can help make something amazing from a fairly ordinary apartment.
In fact, it might make a wish not to leave, as it happened with Joanne.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a bounty hunter acting in the Chicago skyscraper, who competes with a colleague for a promotion.
Does not read any other than the earned money, which, alongside, forgets any ethics.
His wife and three children see only the early morning and late night.
In the first half of the film, the idea is that it is the business world version of the card house, even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler.
As the film further, the less volatile element remains, and the intent of the film-makers moralizing is beginning to keep shining.
A life-changing experience becomes a head-to-son illness of cancer.
It is now necessary to make a choice between work and family life.
A son dreaming of an architectural office will place his father in the large buildings of Chicago with the big things of great importance, such as faith, goodness, love... without touching, even a twin-towers catastrophe.
After the third scene where his son opens his eyes, the film makers have a feeling of being guided by the target audience will surely cry out, because even the most darkest hearted viewer will not be able
When a son falls in a coma and his condition is desperate, the father will finally understand the morals of his work and make a good deed for the old man looking for a job.
Now I'm betting myself on myself if the film has a happy end, I'm going to predate my insightfulness after a movie in the coffee, if I'm wrong, it's time for at least one surprise.
For the moment, there is a suspicion that a missing coffee will occur-when a husband calls Dane from a hospital, and the man torses in slow motion along the hall.
And although his father has lost his job, it proves to be positive, because now it is time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too--I can predict the end of American drama quite well!
It is true that the film is well-designed, all the necessary elements are available.
You can cry, you can laugh, actresses are good and morale beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I guess that movie's going well.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the presidential media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will actually do it.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the White House's new personnel chief is planning to limit the flow of information from President Trumpin, including news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in a more smooth water.
Here's a fragment from a reporter, Josh dawsey:
"As the new HR chief of the White House, John F. Kelly, on his first working day with high-ranking officials, he brought out the key issue of President Donald Trump at the White House, which he planned to solve the bad information in the hands of the president.
Kelly told officials that the information must be moved through her, either on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions than to share good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it, and they've got the Trump tamping her from the media consumption monitor failed.
President Truman's relationship with TV goes up to decades, and now, when he's in the White House, his TV viewing habits haven't gone anywhere.
"When a candidate of Trump was displeased by the unhonest media coverage, he paid to show that he was also recognised frankly in the affected editions," said a former campaign adviser, Sam Nunberg in February politicole.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "the six former campaign workers said that the trump card is key to managing the Trump, which is to ensure that the personal media consumption is also stable in the film."
All right, then.
But the idea that the Trump Twitter exercise habits have never been "controlled", is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know that Trump's chirping would have been even more salivate without these interventions.
We're probably never going to know about the tweets you didn't post.
If his assistants managed to get him out of trouble for a couple of times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent the Trump from causing a consistently controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of competing clicks, people are trying exclusively to promote their own interests by conveying to the drum material that supports their worldviews, but not always reliable.
In May, in May, the whole story Politico wrote a tendency to feed the president with a strategically questionable value.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Current and former drum subordinates say that Trump can react to negative press, particularly for adverse effects, exponently, taking an obsession to isolate their source.
This was also the case in the end of February, when someone forgave the president a printed copy of the GotNews.com article of the website of Charles C. Johnson, which accused the staff chief Deputy Katie Walshi, that he was White House "a source of several leaflets".
It makes no difference that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitteror because of the harassment, or that he did not provide any specific evidence or that he or she had also filed false charges in the past and rebutting them.
Trump was reading the article and beginning to inherit the subordinate of Walter. "
Goldmacher added that at the time the staff chief Reince Priebus and the White House's office manager, Rob Porter, have attempted to establish a system for managing and documenting the documents reaching Trumpin.
How did it manage?
Kelly's trying to do exactly that three months later.
Maybe he's an effective leader, but Trump's still impulsive, and his helpers are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from the foreign capital will not be allowed to impersonalize.
In the centre of Tallinn There are a number of foreigners.
Those with whom the õhtuleht became a woman were admitted to play in the old town without the permission of the city government.
First, we found three street musicians, close to the Viru gates, who had taken the same number of dogs.
It was clearly seen that musicians with dreaddogs and smelly clothes were backpack travelers who could use one shower to make a mark.
In spite of appearance, the only woman in the company played an accordion with a amusing rhythm, while one of the men juggling his three balls and then called the Pasters closer.
The third man was sitting next to them for a backpack and smoked a blunt-wrapped joint.
Their three dogs were not allowed to disturb the passing people.
He was juggling the accordion with Noemi and his balls... and he said that he'd make the streets for fun and money.
The goal of the company was to collect the money for a ship running on the same day night.
On the question of whether they asked the city for a muschwork in Old Town, you rocked Noemi and Bob's head.
First of all, we didn't know.
Second, we never stay in one city for more than a day or two, and mostly they give permits for a month or something.
There's no point in paying for it "he explained to Bob.
About 20 minutes later, we came back to the Viru gates, we saw that two women are at the musicians and they're going to make them go.
The company moved to the central junction of the Viru Keskus with backpacks and dogs to touch happiness.
On Viru Street There were also three Polish young men, one of whom played violin, the second Claron, and the third was a fortunate result of electronic piano.
"We are here to provide entertainment to people, to spread music and joy, and to earn money for fuel and residence," he explained the trio pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that the city government has to be authorised to appear.
"Of course we don't have it", he said joking.
But we hope that when people enjoy our music, then there is no problem.
Of course, when the cops come, we go somewhere else, but we gotta try, "he added.
Eesti Pank has purchased, in the context of the Euro Central bank's public sector asset purchase programme, in July, 149 million for euro bonds, the central bank's bond portfolio increased to EUR 4.36 billion.
Central bank has no more detailed information on purchases.
In reply to the consultation of members of the Riigikogu, President Hardo Hansson has previously explained that the Eurosystem's asset purchase plan covers three different purchase programmes: financial sector bonds (covered bonds), asset-backed debt securities (ABS) and public bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors who have sold bonds to invest elsewhere.
Purchases result in lower-risk asset performance and it motivates investors to take greater risks.
As a rule, every central bank buys its government bonds in the framework of a public debt purchasing programme, and the bonds of other countries are not purchased.
As the Estonian state does not issue bonds, the Bank of Estonia makes so-called substitute purchases within the volume allocated to them.
The substitution is also made by the central banks of those countries where the offer of bonds for the purchase plan is limited.
As a rule, Eesti Pank buys debt securities from European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank (EIB) bonds, in Hansson's confirmation.
Eesti Pank buys bonds under the asset purchase programme starting from 2015. In March 2006.
Meanwhile, Elering's bonds were purchased but the 2016. From June 2015, the Bank of Estonia no longer buys elering bonds.
On behalf of the central banks of the euro area, the Finnish central bank buys both Elering and Eesti Energia's bonds from June.
The pilgrims ignore the ditch and return to the "Millionaires District"
Some of West Midlands's Wealviest homeowners have come back to fiercest confrontation with resolute migrants who have ignored a ditch excavated by the Council to win back a field that is not from their wool.
The pilgrims have parked their 20 caravans into a prosperous "millionaires" division, near the baptized Solihull Street.
They returned with the Army of horses, children and trucks after they were kicked out of the corn, without letting themselves be mixed up in a ditch dug by the Council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found the barrier areas to a weak spot, squeezing their vehicles through the unobstruded parts that were left on the Foothand.
The furious inhabitants have been disguised as Solihull Council, saying that the council is "useless when dealing with the problem".
One anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after they were eviding from Bentley Heath, where they were throwing rocks at the passes.
The Council must be disgraced in order for them to act, because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The Wanderers were in the corn, they were gone, and now they're back.
They came in last night, more likely today.
He added: Birmingham's council knows how to deal with such matters by acquiring long restraints to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I'm not satisfied that I have to continue paying the duty, unless the Council can even prevent such a thing. "
One local resident, who wished also to remain anonymous, said: "This is ridiculous. We just saw how the last of those travelers left, and there's been a new offensive.
This time the number has grown, and the grassland even has been seen as a horse ruminant. "
A spokesman of Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campsite on the land near Streetsbrook Road, and we work with the Solihull Police. We implement the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
The taking of evidence is very helpful when as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help create an image for the court if we present the case. "
Weekend Festival is also visited by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is delighted that it has been able to bring real world top names.
The question of why Weekend Festival is so important to Estonians is that the island is in compliance with all those who enjoy the full three days of the festival.
However, he finds out that the real men of the field have arrived in Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre are brought home, and this is often not happening in our area", says the minister of Culture.
What are the artists at the festival which are the most spoken of by the island?
I consider myself to be the oldest, and for the old ones like me, it is certainly one of the most experienced artist Armin van Buuren who stepped up last night.
Well, according to his juitus, all of us, at some point, have been spinning ourselves, "he says.
However, he also brings out several names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our Estonian makers: starting from noëp and can be considered a whole line.
In reality, this well-known naming concentration is very high ", he says.

Audi updates automotive hit criticism from mid to 850 000 diesel vehicles
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it offers software upgrades for more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the chairman of BMW, the Company believes that "there are smarter variants than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including the BMW home city, to Munich, which has considered the prohibition or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would renovates three million Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions of diesel engines.

European autoproducers have advertised in Europe and the United States of America enthusiastically in the use of diesel vehicles to help comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitric oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and may cause asthma.
In addition, the cost of the equipment to be installed for the neutralising of the emissions of diesel vehicles to the automotive industry increases, making it difficult to maintain price for cars as competitive.
While German automobile manufacturers are in a thorough investigation, the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkeli's government is also accused of ignoring the signs of a more powerful automobile manufacturer and a problem referring to the issue.

Journalist murder emphasises the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans for the most recent chaos of the state of Sinaloa, sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and incrimatised drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They tell them it's important to change their routines.
Two senior writers discuss, which seems safer: bring the children to the office that was 2009. Or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words to the board at the head of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They're going to ask the reporters for each column to give you the proof is not necessary, it is enough impressions and feelings.
In the presence of government or cartels, drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being a whole list of pahalasi who make the recognition of the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
There is no pause for violence, and the more dead bodies across the country accumulate, the majority of these journalists in the Committee of Journalists ' Protection, according to the data, are by the President Enrique Pena Nieto to appoint 2012. At least 25 in December. 589 the journalist has been under national protection after attacks and threats, and during that year, at least seven journalists in seven states have died.
The most recent fatalities include their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," it was written by Valdez in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence gives a deeply felt, although his presence may be perceived everywhere on the façade of the Riodoce building, a large picture of the middle of Valdeza hangs with the letter "Justice" and two of the 30s reporter, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts, Showing the face of his smiling glasses, or a panamahat.
The meeting will be held less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although the 2010. In 2003, the Committee on the Protection of Journalists has established only two cases of judicial prosecution.
As in the case of most annual drug trafficking and organised crime, the number of which reaches thousands, the killers of journalists are seldom prosecuted.
In the editor of Riodoce, the recognition of violence in Sinaloas will continue, although their hearts are broken and the terrain is now even more dangerous.
Without the data of the murderers and no justification, the security meeting of Ibarra is not very useful.
"It's very silly to have your time in this meeting wasted," he says.
"As long as the reason is not known, you have no confidence in everyone."
Valdez left the state capital of the RIODOCE office in Culiacanis. May morning.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before the two men stopped the red Toyota Corolla. He was forced to exit the car and was shot 12 times. It is expected to be the name of the newspaper, which translates into "the 12th river."
An armed man drove off Valdez's car and crashed it in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two grown children.
Rumors are spreading in Culiacan freely.
But there is only silence on Valdez.
From the arrest of Guzman last year, and in January of the United States, the blue Bean has been one of the most bloomin' battlefields in the country because rival clicks struggle to enforce a power vacuum.
It does not matter that the Sinaloa streets are released by a person or several days each day, or that a cemetery is teeming with a series of double-blind mausoleum of drug kings that are bigger than the many living homes.
Let us forget for a moment that peace-time points to the fact that the seaside state, with valuable ports and drug routes leading to the United States of America, manages only one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers inherent in his work, Riodoce, the founder and director Ismail Bojorquez (60), feels the enormous guilt that he couldn't protect his friend.
He believes the killing has encouraged two mistakes.
The first of these was the cartel with the sons of Guzmani on a competitive and military footing and click on the Ninamehe Damaso Lopez interview in February.
This piece may have been the gang members suspicious of the sons bought every copy of the publication as soon as they reached the newspaper stalls.
The second flaw was that Valdezi was not compelled by his own security, in the name of his own country, after the raid was held in another of the same story in the newspaper.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he had always existed.
He worked 2003. In the newspaper Noroeste, he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce, selling 50-dollar units...
Bojorquez said that Sinaloas "was impossible to press without the drug problem untouched".
The newspaper's collection will multiply with its bold and fair coverage, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish robust research without censorship, and the readers were fascinated by the publication, which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for his Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez was awarded the International Press Freedom Award for his courage to follow the drug story of Mexico wherever it leads.
He admitted openly that he feared.
"I want to go on living," he said when you received a prize.
Last October, he said on a television channel Rompeviento TV given an interview that drug trafficking is a sinaloas lifestyle.
"You have to embrace a task that the journalist will be accompanied by a second chance to play dumb."
I don't want you to be asked what I did with so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on.
The collective of Riodoce yearns for Valdezi, the Joker who roiled like a sailor, a friend who graciously shared the embrace and advice of a teacher who knew how to survive.
They were relying on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar at the office across the street and sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if her routine love became fatal to her.
His death has put them in doubt, how to do his job best and stay alive.
"They do not like to mess with their wives, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used for the transportation of drugs."
"These things weren't supposed to be touched," said Bojorquez.
The result even in the best of times is strong self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
The editor of Riodoce, according to Andres Villarreali, is the problem that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javich."
He and others say that in Sinaloa no longer applies to the old rules, as they do not apply to Tamaulipasis, Veracruzis, Guerreros or other states that are home to profitable smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt public officials The
The terrain is constantly changing.
In the space in which RIODOCE staff were exposed for security training, the sudden no-cell phones were allowed; Some days before it was exposed that only spyware sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two policemen were looking for relief from the 40-degree heat in the shade of the tree.
The government appointed them to guard the RIODOCE office, housed in a four-storey building in the middle-class neighbourhood of the Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered in half-jokes about whether these policemen were among the 50 percent of police officers, whose governor himself was stamped untrusted.
It has been a few months since the reporters have traveled to mountainous countryside where control is a de facto drug gang.
Riodoce this week's edition dealt with three main manifesto.
One of them was the murder of the ex-boxer, Julio Cesar Chavez's brother, in Sinaloas.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor's home town.
And from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan's cabinet, a group of people was robbed from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it had to be cautious when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows about the restaurant as a place for both drug traders and public authorities.
The Reporter learned from the public documents that the restaurant was registered to the name of a politician who belongs to the institution of the institutional revolution in power (IRP), which dominated all the levels of the policy over the last century.
More recently, several IRP governors have been accused of widespread prosecution in cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the moniker the son of Guzman from El Chapo had escaped the military line.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched for Valdez's column to get information on kidnapping from the best sources.
"Previously, we would have known what was going on," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose conformation of Beanpole has earned him the nickname of El Flaco.
"Now all the channels of communication are broken with our sources."
Valdezi's office has received storage storage for labels and stickers that protest against the killing of journalists, and editorial workers have received something that they could never wait for activists for the sake of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few tags and went to the local public prosecutor's Office for a demonstration of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in western Michoacan state three days after Valdez was killed.
They found a burnt body, and according to the officials, it belongs to him on the DNA tests.
Journalists have become more vocal throughout the country, and scribble organised protestina on sidewalks and buildings with the phrase "SOS press".
On this day, manager Bojorquez has been removed from D.C., attempting to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death in the Sinaloa governorate, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because of the truth.
After that, he asked him to direct a statement of Government's activities elsewhere, worrying that he had an impact on his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists had been organised as "restricted" by organized crime, co-culpatist civil servants and uncomplicated societies.
In his last book, The drug Press, he wrote that reporters do not only kill drug gangs, but also by order of politicians and security forces, who have organised crime.
The media Monitoring Group, Articulo 19, attributed more than half of the attacks by journalists to police and civil servants last year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to be silenced," said Ramirez.
The murders clearly have a bloodfreeze.
No one would forget the blogger Maria Elizabeth Maciase's death in the northern border state of Tamaulike six years ago.
His body was found together with a letter that was believed to have signed a cartel in Los Zetas, "I'm here because of my reports."
Next to his decapped head, the computer keyboards and headphones were lying.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the EU Norte newspaper, the northern border state Chihuahuas, after the assassination of these correspondents Miroslava breach in March.
The others are going forward as they did in the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after their director of the assassination of 2004. In.
In the 2010 newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez called drug cartels publicly with the "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists are from home states or even fled the country.
It's a nerve-racking decision.
In exile, it's hard to find a job and they still have to piled off the streets to avoid the risks.
And sometimes they are hunted, as presumably photographer Ruben Espinshare, who was murdered with four women in 2015. In one of Mexico's apartments, three months after the Veracruz's exile.
Those who remain in place and continue to work will have to dance a few risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wished to become a poet, acknowledges that the reflection of a drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexico is on its way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
One recent Friday at midnight, when the latest number was already locked, the riodoce editors were seated in front of the office on the sidewalk and with a sip of beer when abruptly started to vibrate on all the phones.
In the beachfront resort town of Mazatlantis, 19 people had been confirmed in fire exchanges between rival gangs and the security forces.
The war continued to escalated, as promised by several of the areas found in cartels.
From the very edge of the sidewalk, reporters put the news on a mobile phone using the RIODOCE website.
The front cover of the next day needed to be changed.
The sirens were hookdown another gunfire in the area.
Bojorquez is a peeved officer on guard duty to see if they're vigilant.
If they were scared, they didn't show up at least.
Under the face of the fallen founder of the newspaper, with his middle finger showing the whole sinaloc, Riodoce was busy in his footsteps.
"How could you even think of closure," said Bojorquez, "when the same day Javier was killed, he asked the trainee to send him to do a report on the streets?"
The dinosaur used a protective colour to prevent enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, albeit rather scary.
The researchers have now unveii the first findings concerning the Canadian trench discovered with the incredible creature of the rhino size that has been so well preserved that the experts have described it as "dinosaur Mona Lisa."
It is indeed so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that its small-coated skin was reddish-brown in color and his past was somewhat "intricate".
This report, published in current Biology, described the entity as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the finest dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a new species of Nodosaurus, which lived in the midst of the chalk, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good survival of the bog researchers, who describe it as "truly remarkable".
This gender-covered vegetarian, according to National Geographic magazine, is best preserved by this type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was found on 21. On March 2011 Shawn Funk, when he complained to the Suncor Millenium mine at Fort McMurray near North Albertas in Canada.
He caught something that didn't resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to look into it.
The fossils found were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, it was designed to dig out the animal from the 2500-female (1100-pound) parcel.
After all this traveling, the end result is now ready to be prepared for public.
"If you squint a little eye, you can almost believe that she is asleep," said the leading author, Caleb Brown, a research fellow at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is exhibited.
"It will go into the research history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs"-as an added dinosaur Mona.
While studying his skin, researchers found that the plant-feeder, although covered in armor and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely to have endangered considerably the flesh-eating dinosaurs.
This large, salty dinosaur used the colour of red and white defence to hide from predators, and applied the shadow technique, called the "Shelter", used by many of today's animals.
This allowed the experts according to the dinosaur to blend into the surroundings and avoid enemies as the larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt it down.
This 110 million-year-old entity belonging to the Nodosaurus family first reached the news in May and is now visited at the Royal Tyrrelli Paleontology Museum.
The researchers have now studied the creature and gave it the name of the Borealopelta Markmitchelli Museum, according to Mark Mitchell, who belonged to a team that spent more than 7000 hours on the animal's arduous uncovering.
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of the specimen, Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the scales on the body.
They discovered a method of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the top half of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although the objection has spread, the findings come as a surprise, since Borealopelta is much larger than animals with an outshadow nowadays.
It suggests that the dinosaurs were actively hunting the other carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution preferred to have a survival tactic in lieu of confrontation.
However, the vast majority of animals that use counter-eclipse-e.g. deer, zebras or armadillo-are much smaller and more vulnerable to the harvest, suggesting that Nodosaurus must have been able to truly work to survive.
"Vigorous hunting of the immensely large and numerous gender-covered dinosaurs shows how dangerous the predators could have been," said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the scales revealed also that the skin of the dinosaurs was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to create an investigation to gain clues about this life, including the contents of its gut, to find out what the animal had eaten for the last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river dying, reaching the flow into the sea, where he sank his back towards the ocean floor.
In the meantime, Albertas was as warm as it was now in South Florida, and the rivers and oceans would probably have far beyond the mainland.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved armor, but has also remained three-dimensional, preserving the animal's original shape," said Brown.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost like the same as in the chalk era.
You don't have to use a lot of imagination to rethink it-it's just a squatting, and he feels like he's asleep.
There was a time in the critic era when huge carnivorous dinosaurs were wandering on the ground on massive two feet.
While their all King Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than the Borealopelta, it could have been an armored dinosaur hunting some of his frighting predecessors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 meters) tall and a six-ton monster weighing.
Scientists, whose recent findings are published in the current Biology journal, believe that the borealopelta washed in the sea after death, and it was mumified in the mud.
The creature was discovered by 21. On March 2011 Shawn Funk, he dug up the Millenium mine at Fort McMurray near North Albertas in Canada.
According to the museum, it is best preserved in the world, including leather and scales, and it is a complete cone up to the tree.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighing up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two of the 20-inch long spike was invaded from its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this salty-covered plant feeder adventures through the current West Canada, up to an flooded river at its offshore pride.
But the burial site of a dinosaur sea helped preserve the exquisite detail of its scales.
The fossilized remand of this particular specimen is so well preserved that the nubbous arched flaps along the skulls are still covering the remains of the skin.
As the Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic, "This degree of preservation is as rare as a lottery victory."
The more I look at it, the more unbelievable it seems.
Petrified skin remains still cover nubbous arched plates in the animal's skull.
The right front foot lies beside him and the five toes are stretched upwards.
I'm able to count the scales on his farm. "
How one activist found the answer to the question, "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was full of shock.
Only a day after he was traveling to New York, he sat on a bed in his rented room via Airbnb, a resident of St. Louis, while browsing through Facebook.
He got into the post of his date.
It said, "the police just murdered a youngon an 18-year-old, and he's still lying in the street."
He was confused as to why no one else had this information posted in his flow, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
With a handle @TheePharoah the user posts were repeatedly distributed on his timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis region transmitted real-time tweets to Michael Brown's death of an unarmed 18-year-old black young man who was killed by a white police officer at Ferguson in Missouri.
He posted a picture of brownies ' life from the body that was lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"This is insane," Ferrell was thinking.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away, but he saw the tweets that came back the night, which reported this time that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Pictures of the police and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept the label "Ferguson's police have just killed my unarmed son!"
He was looking at the real-time flow of the officer standing in front of the protest group with a barking dog.
In another video, Vinnastas another policeman, according to his rifle, and cried, "I will kill all of you... animals."
Ferrellile remembers how he struck himself with the idea: "It's unusual."
"" This is not the kind of murder that we are accustomed to and what we might call a typical. "
I felt the shivers at the time.
I was angry and I cried. "
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
Having landed at 23, he went to his father for his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would ride Ferguson the next morning.
What was happening with Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the central issue in a new documentary on "Whose Streets?" ("Whose streets?"), which premieres in cinemas 11. August.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, strength and toughness from those people's standpoint who live in this community and who filled out answers by demanding the streets.
When Ferrell and his daughter-who had wearing a floral dress and had a fitting in the head with a crown of Ferguson, they discussed again on the subject, which they had come before this morning on numerous occasions-black experiences and living conditions.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community was supposed to fight for your rights?" He reminds me of a question.
"We're driving to Ferguson right now because police killed an 18-year-old boy, and it's not right."
"I couldn't take him with me," Ferrell said later.
"What's happening right now... is the culmination of the past.
He must know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activism and the organization, while at the same time experiencing the different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we have to do to become free and free ourselves.
Even if I succeed in raising him so that he does not experience brazen himself, he is no different than another black girl.
I feel I would do him a disservice if I were to protect him from this world. "
The first stop they did when they arrived at Ferguson was on the road from South Florlord to the police station in a place on the road, which had become a certain kind of campsite where activists waited for news about cop Darren Wilson who had not been presented Finally, charges.
There joined Ferrell and his daughter to the forces of the local business owner, who prepared the lunch times.
They put food bags together and helped them share them with the protechers.
Ferrell for it started to slowly take the shape of a new type of activism.
"My activism completely changed after the 9th In August, "he said, noting that when he was a student of the University of Missouri, he was a minority president of the Union of nursing students and focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organization experience.
It was all just plain. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met a film co-director Sabaah Folayang at the time of the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and the cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document the happening.
Ferrell came up with the question, "Are you trying to document the happening or find a story that can be exploited?"
This scepticism was the result of an innumerous number of cases in which people – often the white-eye – come into the community and seek to benefit from this pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that Ferguson born and raised people's voices are not taken to hear and we wanted to make it differently."
Folayan had already hit his hands with the co-director Damon Davis, the artist of the district, who was known by activism in relation to death sentenced prisoners.
His involvement made it a project of compelling Ferrell and another six other local ones, seeking the movie "Whose Streets?" The team watched after the Brown shooting.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or us, but we speak for ourselves," said Davis.
"For me it was important how these people depict, since both depict me."
Although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell, it was meant to show that movement is not about "the Redeager's instruction, but in the gathering of the community", as in Folayan, he became the most open part of the film.
As a result, the document "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying your wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he was ready to see the linen.
"But I have realised that a certain vulnerability must be accompanied by a degree of uncanadability between this work and the humankind of people."
What's more, Ferrell's story emphasizes and restates the role of the Central Blacks homosexual woman in the broader Black Lives of the trip.
Two of the three initiers who mean social media 2012. After the killing of a black teenage Trayvon Martini, a thematic reference #BlackLivesMatter, is homosexual.
"In a leading role black, homosexual women have kept moving universally in the area," Ferrell said, "and this is precisely because we are constantly fighting on many fronts.
Black homosexual women have to carry the full burden. "
Folayan agreed, stating that "the movement is true to the lives of black women, and many of them are black, homosexual women".
He argues, however, that ' it is not a matter of a type of equal opportunity to be created '-Ferrell was not the focal point of a film because of his identity.
"He was a man, who had the right energy of the night," he said.
"But it's no coincidence that he was directly on the front line because, as a black homosexual woman at the junction, there's a lot at stake.
His energy can be perceived through the screen. "
At the same time, the news cameras from Ferguson are long gone, but the racial links between the community and the police are still fragile.
Ferrellile's demonstration at the time of the road blocking in a conditional sentence lasts another 2.5 years.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in the region that he calls home, just "the Hugebodie."
Nevertheless, it continues to be an important mantra, which it has been etted into memory from the time he went to Ferguson's streets a whole three years ago.
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We don't have to lose anything except our chains. "
7 tips on how to get over a weekend celebration of Pohmellist
Well, some of the strongest sons of men will find after a napping party, and the trouble, the help.
Or the testimony of "avoid hangover, stay drunk."
But this is only the inevitable postponement and the health of the proper thug.
What can you do to get to the end of today and tomorrow's Day of the Tralli or other feast to feel better and to be painlessly overcome by the hanmelly?
Drink some water.
And then, after the big party in the morning... or even if possible, instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses alcohol by consuming plenty of fluids, it must somehow get it back.
Mineral substances are also removed from the body with water, and the convex is good for drinking mineral water.
Because your stomach is often agitated after you drink, it's especially good if it's a bubble-free or just slightly aerated.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure it wouldn't cost a hangover to go to grandma to break trees-that could prove to be a false decision.
But a light walk will help the body remember again what it feels like to be alive.
Lying in a tent and getting out of a hanbury is a time-consuming way to go.
Give the body the energy back slowly and carefully.
If you're about to vomit from yesterday, you won't be able to try to load a big, fat steak.
For example, start with the fresh juice containing the fruit slices your body is going to be softly pamgy.
If the lunch places are already suffering, you might want to try such a broth.
And a little later on the ridge.
Avoid the coffee.
This diuretic releases your body from last water.
As already stated: Water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent hangover in the evening, you need to get your liver out of it with paracetamol or ibuprofen, and lose performance.
So you ruin your liver even more, and the Hanmaas are worse.
In addition, the painkiller will not stay in the body for much longer.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it on an empty stomach... it irritates your already torn stomach.
Or if you don't take a partner, get along with yourself.
It's like walking, but you can't have an orgasm when you walk.
Avoid too much active gear and crazy poses-hangover, the physical effort should be moderate.
Just kidding.
Make simple fools and laugh all Over yourself and others (suffering) with time friends and co-sufferers.
A joke and laughter may not make a hanapie, but it is certainly more fun to use them.
Someday The hangover will be over anyway!
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University staff are wanted for suspects of murder
Police say they seek a national search for the department of Northwestern University and Oxford University staff, who have become suspects after finding the body of a man in a Chicago luxury apartment after a deadly stabbed wound.
According to the Cook County judicial documents, there are no bail-free warrants issued on Monday, for the arrest of the 42-year Wyndham Lathemi and 56-year-old Andrew Warren, accused of first-degree murder because of their alleged involvement in Trenton H. The death of James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated statting.
According to an alert issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on 27. July.
The policemen had a phone call and found a victim, whose body had several stab wounds.
According to the officials, Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene, and investigators regard a stab in murder while the police were actively seeking two suspects.
Lathem have been working since 2007. From Northwestern University as a co-professor of microbiology and immunology.
Vice-President of public relations at the university, Alan K. Cubbage, said in a statement sent by e-mail that Lathem has now been temporarily suspended and is forbidden to enter the cities of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal case by the competent authorities, and the University of Northwestern is working with the investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is an senior assistant at the finance Department of Oxford University.
A representative of the university and Somerville College, said in a statement sent by e-mail: "We have been connected with the UK police and ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way possible."
In addition, the application says that Warren's colleagues are shocked and willing to give themselves up.
Anthony Guglielmi, a department of communications at the Chicago Police Department, urges the suspects to turn himself in to the authorities.
"The police have an idea where they're staying, but we're increasingly working on precise location definition," says Guglielmi.
Guglielmi says that the suspects can be searched by local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said that the police made a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received an encrypted hint that there was something in the apartment No. 1008.
According to police specifications, it was a hideout.
According to Guglielmi, it is unclear whether the event itself took place on 27 June. July.
He said the security cameras were confirming latheism and Warren's stay in the building.
"We believe that Professor Lathamil and sacrifice had a relationship," added Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza management sent the inhabitants a letter: "The police are currently working on the chronology of events and the background of the victim and investigate different motifs, including the possibility of a family tyto."
To help prevent your company from receiving the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of his employees at the e-commerce company, but the polls were not profitable.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to assure anonymity, some employees did not confided in this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who manages 75 employees in San Francisco, the e-commerce company Madison Reed.
So he called the outside persons to help.
New types of human resources are emerging as a start to help companies find out what their employees are feeling.
By developing and licensing software that is designed to measure employee involvement, they enable companies to make smart interviews, target specific teams and demographic groups, to provide workers with anonymity and a hot complaint The line and in some cases allow language carriers to go along the C-level drivers and turn directly to the Executive Board.
"There are now tools such as Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City Start-up glint, with software analytics tools using Companies to measure employee involvement.
According to Erretti, he's got a much better view of what his employees think and feel over three years since he used the gtape.
In addition to surveys and specific teams, this will provide a company's heat card, which provides an overview of which departments have most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, enabling them to identify Causes.
Businesses have begun to realise that they have to stay up to date with their work culture, so as not to become the next Uber, which has been wrapped in scandals since the former employee published a blog post describing a harassed environment in which They were punished for those who dare to speak.
For start-ups such as glint, there is an overview of owning a desire for a profitable business opportunity.
The global management, regulatory and compliance areas may be subject to the Financial Technology statistics website, Let's Talk Payments to Data 2020. The year worth more than 118.7 billion dollars.
Denveris Colorados, which is a corporate convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, this year observed a background of interest and activity on the backdrop of a dubious reputation of Uber.
Convercentil has almost 600 clients, among them Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
As Glintki, the convercent companies will send customized pulse surveys, collect real-time confidential responses, and view thermal cards from problematic areas.
It also offers anonymous messaging, allowing employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when the CEO is concerned, the complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has been ansavaged by regulators," said Convercenti, founder and CEO of Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that when a company is found to treat its employees poorly or to behave unethical, the company may face serious consequences, such as consumer boycott, worker resignation and lawsuits, even if the regulatory authorities did not Interfere.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25 000 employees at 500 sites, has been using Convercen for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures, and to provide an easy way to interact with a corporate headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find a phone number or e-mail address for a corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope to be taken seriously.
It was often a dainting and uncomfortable process, said Ruby's Tuesday General advisor James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to track employees ' complaints.
But now that the company uses Convercen, there are problems, such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair wage actions that did not previously reach executives who acted at offices in other cities or states, to quickly identify and Deal with them.
"I'm able to get closer to the staff's holistic 360-degree experience," said Vitrano, who is leading Ruby Friday risk management.
"And we will protect our shareholders against litigation."
Quinlan said that companies started to take the ethical behaviors, values and employee involvement into much more serious 2002. The year after the audit firm Arthur Andersen crashed into an ethical violation due to Enron's scandal.
But only when "social media became mature", the companies realized that they couldn't prevent their dirty laundry from being publicly washed on the web.
"Before using technology to track ethical behaviour, people are using hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent are offering their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for using their products.
It is a business model and an option with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supportive of both the company.
In February, Convercenti sponsored companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola capital to raise their accumulated capital to 47 million.
In November, Gtape invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing its total corporate funding to 60 million.
Such investments do not come as a surprise to take into account the interdependence of business, culture and venture capital.
Increasingly, research has shown that modern workers expect more than ever before.
In competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are simply the stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy in the company, they feel that they are being heard, and that the work they do is rewarding, they are more committed to the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, who is vice president of the Department for General benefit and employee experience On LinkedIn, which uses Convercen as well as Gtape.
Investors earn income when companies in their portfolios are doing well; Businesses are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If the analytical tools of the third party allow for increased commitment and involvement of employees, it is not a wonder that they will find support.
The possession of data on employee involvement is important according to work culture experts.
However, these data are useless if the company's supervisors are not going to do anything about it.
In fact, if a company asks its employees for feedback, it may raise expectations of the changes that are ahead.
And if the changes do not happen fast enough or not at all, it can cause frustration and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask the 4000 proposal, you must be ready for a 4000 interview," said consultancy and business Management Kotter International President Russell Raath, who has seen the way companies make a mistake with that rely too much on data collection.
"For when things are not going to end, the staff will think," Did you actually take me to the hearing?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why would I care? " "
According to Erretti, Madison Reed, who has now arranged a six-monthly study in the workforce, has been able to take action on the same day as the problem has been reported through the Gtape.
And after receiving feedback from workers frustrated by decision-making and quality of communication, he was able to restructure several teams in the company and provide communication training.
However, Ruby Tuesdays collects new data on employees and hopes that, in the long run, it will lead to a longer-term commitment of workers in the industry, known for its high workforce turnover.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, then you lose people," said Vitrano.
"And when you lose people, you lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose companies. "
The bright star of the euro area is the Baltics: incomes grow rapidly
Although the 2008. In crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on Baltic states, the three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the incomes of Western European rich countries, writes Bloomberg with reference to the European Central Bank report.
From 1999. The total annual economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania was over expectations.
Success is low in debt, fast healing institutions, and business and free market friendly policies.
"The Baltic states in one of the euro area countries, where the real GDP per capita in purchasing has been significantly approached by the EU average", the central bank has reported.
Although the objective is such that the total output of the economy per capita is equal to the richer western Europe, it accounted for 2015. The total production of Baltic economies per capita was only 2/3 15 of the national average which belonged to the European Union before 2004. A round of enlargement.
The low wages have led ballets to look for a better wage abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light, and the economy is growing this year, the local inhabitants are not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvian and Lithuanian residents assessed that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, it was slightly less than half of the respondents ' economies.
The NCAA decision to set aside twice daily trainings changes the Bruins ' days to a long
It's almost 23 when the Trobkond UCLA footballers stop to have a chat at the edge of the new training square on the team campus.
Some of them have been hatched off a shirt, exposing your training camp for the first day of efforts to sweat his back.
For a large part of the team, these idle minutes take a midday break.
The players attending the Suvistel courses are headed back to the dorm for graduation exams after a three-hour workout before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6.30.
"The next three days are a real ordeal for them," said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday received Tuesday.
The NCAA decision to revoke players ' burdens twice daily will be held on the trennes, in fact their days have been changed — at least until the final exams to one side until the end of Friday.
For this reason, the first three workouts at UCLA were scheduled to begin at 19.15 to fit the already tight schedule of players.
The transition from two classes a day means more with one trennine the start of the Bruins training camp, compared to the previous season, almost a week ahead, and the first time in the six WESTWT seasons. During courses.
They have up to 20. In August, it will be 18 hours before the official preparation for September is the opening game against Texas A&M.
According to Mora, he is the NCAA's rule of change, even though it adds a single item to the close charts of the players.
"They are in three or four days a huge load and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they will break through this ora; They're a great youth.
I believe when the Saturday arrives and we have more time, it's really enjoyable. "
When the camp is over, UCLA will make the trainings closed, which is not an easy task, considering the clear view of these fields from nearby parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Centre, a superior class hotel that has already been shot From the defence network around the goalpost.
From this weekend, the hotel Bruins will occupy the players, but Mora acknowledges that the problems may occur during the season with free rooms.
"We implement security measures," said Mora.
"This is a real concern and it is not at all exaggerated to believe that people can rent a room and then film their workout.
If you have a recording of training, it might make a pretty good deal.
But we use it there and the 8th. The parking lot security team.
We will make our existing use of the best.
I'm trying not to worry about that.
We have a plan in place. "
The Revenge of the Central Political Election Association Savisaar-Ivanova, the electoral Union for the Reform Party, and the forces of the people forced to give up Maria Kaljuste in Estonia and the political party, created to show the creative Businessmen's election association in Tallinn-it seems that the election coalition created in the party's politics will participate in the municipal elections in the year at least as much as political parties.
However, chicks are counted in the fall, and the key question is whether they all have enough frustrated voters.
Who's going to be with the Savisabaret?
If little has fallen into the supporters of Edgar Savisaar, there might be some events organized in honor of his election coalition.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current central deputies and many unknown faces-will this be the composition of the election coalition?
And is there a reason why the candidate and friends of Savisaare are excluded from the application in Tallinn can look to the fact that the "Savisaare list", led by the corrupt acts of corruption and suspected corruption offences, is Becoming a reality?
On the roof of the city government, a music video was filmed on a Russian-language poplaulule, which takes part in the elder of Lasnamäe District; And in every sense of the primitive computer game in which the protagonist, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must avoid the lompe and squirrels on the road when driving on the bike, does this mean for the first time the Centre Party shall seek the votes of voters of 16 and 17 years of age to be allowed to the ballot boxes?
We look forward to the idea of other political parties in the Youth election campaign.
If the Channel 2 or TV3 viewer views a black square instead of entertainment from the beginning of August, there will be two options: to accept that only the television channel ETV2, ETV +, Tallinn TV, and the English France24 are to be received by to a TV operator.
There are probably also those who are overjowning over advertising-free teleexperience, but ultimately — albeit reluctantly — to pay for the television and advertising.
Deafening music, noisy people and the scum on the streets are almost the unpleasant side effects of every major music festival.
But if you don't want to be a part of our own home, you're going to have to discover the homeland instead of hurting your head and have the sleeping space for the festival's noble stay.
Washington Changes Green card rules
Media outlets cite president Donald Trump, who says the new US immigration plan, which changes the green card rules.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 for people per year, more stringent rules for the procurement of temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the president supports them.
The bill goes to Congress in two chambers.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages, and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers ' money, because it changes the way in which US nationals of other countries issue green cards.
The law reduces chain migration and begins to replace the current program.
The new application process provides an advantage to candidates who speak English and who have the financial means to support themselves and the skills that come in favour of our economy, "said Trump to the United States media outlets said.
The youth of Siberian Seto move to the city, pensioners return to Earth.
Jevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous Seto Goldminers at the former Maana River.
He works at home 140 kilometers from the House of the tributary at the edge of the river in Kullaarbrick.
This is a tough job: Two months in a row without a holiday for 12 hours of work and then only ten days at home and again back.
For three years in Artellis, Anatoli has only seen the gold once.
"There's a hard time: when going in there, check thoroughly that the vodka does not bring in, and out of the way that the gold would not come along", says Anatoli.
Mare Piho chatting with the local Seto Jaani in Haida village who has told him much of his family's memories in Siberia.
Siberian Setode still retains the archaic culture begins to also affect the home-setos, because it is just so fabulous, thinks the most thorough remote Setos researched Piho Mare.
His first trip to Siberia is about 30 years away this year.
During that time, he's been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How much of the sex was still traveling out of Siberia on 19. The 20th century. In the beginning of the century, to get Earth?
It's an outstanding question.
I'm saying the 8000.
I counted it on the story of the Siberian Seto men, who have thought of it.
It's just hard to say, because at the time there may be a group of up to 30 people, but the passport was given only to the man.
The passport was given only to one person, but he was children, sisters and the female female.
See how big this territory was!
It was many times the historical setomato.
It was necessary to educate, manage in some way.
The Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed because here they found themselves in areas that were not exclusively linked to agriculture but also to river (log-raft), gold mines, industry.
For example, in the new-in-chief, many of the Setos later recruited the classified city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (built the Soviet power in uranium enrichment-J. P.) when it was formed.
Were the setod accounted for the majority of the population back then?
Yes, they lived compact.
In addition, a long tradition was maintained to marry and a lot of child.
Seven-eight kids in the family were normal.
How many Siberian Setode culture differed and differs from the Mother Earth's Setode?
They are different, though what was brought here, was never the same there.
They brought a lot of national costumes.
They then made themselves (folk costumes), but they always made a difference to what was brought along and what was done here.
Climate change was strongly influenced by the traditional setode, because it's colder.
The food changed.
For example, in Setomaa meat was salted, but here it was just frozen.
Where are the villages of Siberian Setode, and what life is living there? /Graphics: Alari paluots
Communication with the mainland was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now the Setumaa will return to it, begin to influence them.
Those girls who have lived here in the family are listening to some amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Setode delegation in Estonia who came up to the day of the Seto kingdom at the beginning of July and lived for four days in their homes-J. P.
What's left here is amazing.
"It is extremely easy for the killer to come and go, as the city has an excellent location: the railway node and the intersection of roads", says the salt-Reigo oak, originating from the slaughter.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural places, and pizza can be on every corner.
Kill the top-TOPP city!
There is a small island by the city, through the rolling White River, where the tawards are the usual midget.
"This beautiful place on the train window does not appear", it is reigo.
Who is not afraid of cold water can swim in the river, because the river is full of sources.
I've been swimming there, you can do it!
The river can have a picnic and just do the romance-you can see the river flowing and think about life ahead and behind.
I've been out there walking with my girlfriends, too.
The Ooperisolist Dam has been on the riverbank between the three bridges to get its aariaidki practicing: "The place is by the city, no one will be able to go when it's a hum."
"From the pine forest There is a wonderful view of the tapas, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter, and now, for example, to play a discgolf course, you can rent disks from the sports Centre", lead Reigo.
The old pros, of course, are on their disks, but I'm not even here to play.
It must be a colleague at the Rasmus Hawk's Village for a killer, because he has experienced the discgolfer and has the disks.
He's borrowing me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable from the childhood days of the current expectation.
At least for skiing hours.
There are a lot of tears, frustrations and a few of my sports in this mountain.
Not to mention broken watches and skis.
"All of the city centre is currently full of construction work, all of which becomes unrecognizable", praises Reigo.
It is a very attractive place where summer productions are played, to kill an old and weary whale building.
I am delighted that in 2012 R.A.A.A. Mi, the leader of Märt Meos has accepted my idea and came to make a vaksalist summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with Aleksei Karenin was just over, then 11. August is "waking up at the station" when the old whale building moves around 1980. Years.
"11.0-13. August is the day of Tapa city, which has been the home of the whale, and there are cultural events, including the crowded ", Reigo, who only recommends visiting the city in the days of the Nova.
Small yellow House 1. On Mai Blvd, the museum is already the year 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are very well and very much information", praises Reigo in a place full of the history of Tapa city, most of which focuses on the railway and the military.
Reigo Muigab said that if a kill all the recommended sites go through, the belly will be empty, but fortunately the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good eating places and, while sitting in cafés, sometimes it feels like you're abroad", she describes.
Educated and young soldiers who have come to slaughter spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so that there is a long way in sitting there, that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but there is such an international company.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories about French or Americans.
Soldiers, yes, will move a lot!
In Greece two bulgarans were arrested for illegal camping
Channel BTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who announced that two Bulgarans were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
The police arrested 1. In the morning of August on the Sithonia Peninsula, there were people who were illegally camping, including two Bulgarans.
They were fired on the same day, but the investigation is now happening.
The State Department said to the TV channel bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing penalties on all those who are caught resting in a place not intended for that purpose.
The checks continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court may impose a fine.
Wolves teaching puppies are going to break the sheep.
After a year, the farmworkers of the island of Hiiumaa must provide the wolves with their flock of study material-probably the wolves who have taught puppies have already broken a lot of sheep.
This year, the lamb has broken sheep in the region of Hiiu County on three occasions, with a total of 23 sheep and an injured being eight, says Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the corresponding number was only three years ago 124.
The data of the environmental agency in sync is also the information that the wolf litter was not born on Hiiumaa and the information on the Hunting Council of Hiiumaa is fixed, this year there are two wolf litters on the island.
On the night, the Wolves broke down 15 sheep in Emmaste Parish, in the village of Hiiu
In early morning on Wednesday, wolves in Reheselja village had broken one of the sheep and was severely injured by another, who had to undergo an emergency phase.
The rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear and
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft act on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (Gmovs) and the legislation amending the Plant Protection Act.
The amendment of the Act abandoned the creation of both genetically modified crops and the establishment of a separate database for operators, for that purpose the plant Health register is subsequently used.
Furthermore, the obligation on the GM crop to maintain a prior agreement within the prescribed radius with a person engaged in beekeeping is altered.
Although genetically modified crops are not cultivated in Estonia at the moment, we deem it necessary to have clear rules on the coexistence of genetically modified crops.
At least until the decision to declare the Estonian GMO free ", said the head of Plant Health Department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs Sigmar Suu.
' However, it should be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, take account of the costs and the administrative burden of both the private and the public sector ', added foot.
The draft Act Repeals provisions concerning the management and management of GM crops in Gmovs, and the requirements for the management of GM crop management and start-up.
Specifically with regard to beekeeping, the GM crop grower has a current obligation to inform beekeepers about when they start growing a crop by raising the relevant agreement with the Messier before commencing the promotion.
The draft act has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties are able to familiarize themselves with the information system of the drafts and, if they wish, to give their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes are particularly affected by persons active in the field of plant production, beekeepers and the agricultural administration.
In the European Union, including Estonia, it is allowed to grow only one GM crop maize MON 810.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has any interest in the cultivation of GM crops.
This is because of the circumstances that there is no corn-pest in Estonia, a European straw dier with a maize line of MON 810 resistant.
The varieties of this maize line are also bred for the southern regions and this maize is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In order to obtain assurance, the Ministry of Rural Affairs ordered 2015. And 2016. In 2003, studies of potential GM organisms in the seeds of various varieties of spring swede rape, maize and soya are cultivated in Estonia.
The analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not include extraneous genes, and as a result of the study it was concluded that the seeds of grown rapeseed, maize and soya are not contained in genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be inferred that there is no knowingly growing GM crops in Estonia, and it is also confirmed that accidental contamination has not taken place.
Jose Mourinho thinks that in the form of "genius" by Manchester United recruited "Maticu"
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited Nemanja Maticu with the form of "genius", after being the midfield player of Sampdoria against a Wednesday night of his debut.
From 40, 200 million pounds of Chelsea-purchased player started in Dublin's latest pre-season game before the Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid on Tuesday 2-1 wins the initial lineup, exerting an impression of defence, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira You were free to go to the attachets.
But having left the Blues in the seasonal Asian Tour, Maticul was in desperate need of a machemy, and lasted only 45 minutes. According to Mourinho, it must be certain that before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant way of thinking-he has a football mindset," said Mourinho.
"We help him achieve the form as soon as possible."
As Matic, he began the early lineup of Aviva Stadium with the other newly recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku, and Mourinho began quietly to lay the season in place with his one-starred man.
The Independent unveiled this week that Mourinho still wishes to recruit three footballters, but he confirmed that the club has already taken advantage of the "excellent work", concluding contracts with three of its four priority options.
"I'm the club grateful that they were able to realise the three of the four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can do four four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another swamp son got on the foot with a GSM transmitter on the 1st. On August and this time in Muhu.
The information on Mati Martinson, residing in the sõrves, became the first storer with a transmitter in his finger, and this litter is already in the circle, has left the nest and has joined the large-size overnight collection of Mullutu-Suurlahe.
That is because there are no crops on the finger, the voice of the islands.
This Tuesday, it was already relatively late to ring the throat, the transmitter was attached to another stork and on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the escorts are actually an international project carrying Aivar Leito and Ivar ojaste.
Last year we were equipped with one stormy son named Mati GSM transmitter.
"His activities are all viewable on the Internet: how he went on the way to winter in Spain, for a long time back to the German and Polish border at Toppas, and then came to Saaremaa", spoke Martinson.
The British inventor had the microchip installed in his own body to get into the house and in the car
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed, so that he could easily open his front door, gain access to the office and even start a car.
33-year-old Steven Northam had to install a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger, and now offers this service through his company Bioteq to businesses and individuals, who want to make it easier with technology to live.
He has teamed up with a consultant with an anesthesiologist, Dr. Geoff Watson, in Winchester, located in central London, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam is also changing the locks for houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, asking for the same lock for 300 pounds.
This married father of one child has installed technology in the home as well as in his car BMW Z4, which runs when his hand is on the steering wheel.
White House exhibit went to taxpayers to pay thousands of
According to the military Records published on TIME magazine, the White House decided to fly a Navy helicopter last month for the American production event for the southern terror taxpayers to pay even 24 000 dollars.
Sikorsky's green and white color in the VH-3d, called the "Marine One" at the president's board, was 17. This is the central attraction for the event of American building programmes, which took place on July of the White House.
President Donald Trump, vice president of Mike pence and the White House senior officials have been on their rounds of industrial products from all 50 states.
A helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a yacht and a fire truck from Maine, and a forklift truck made in Mississippi.
According to the documentation of the Esframes Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) responsible for the operation of the helicopter, the military cabinet of the White House requested a helicopter presence with the subcommand, or Fargo, just 36 hours before the helicopter for the "abnormal" event. The South Yard landed.
"I wanted you to be aware of this, because this is an unusually high-priority event," said the HMX-1 commander of the day before the event, in an email about his superior, Deputy Navy chief officer in the field of aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter arrives on the southern yard 17. It's going to be there until the yard is cleaned between 18 and 21 on the same night, at 7:00 a.m.
It has been added that, if it were necessary to leave the White House, it would have to return to another ekipaži due to limitations on working time.
During the event, the original flight crew was at the helicopter and the security team was held near the aircraft during the entire duration of its ground.
It was not possible to read the documents given to the TIME magazine if the other Ekipaži was finally needed or not.
Hatch's law prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 has examined whether this is the event that could be corrupted.
"We asked if it would violate the hatch law, and we were told not to break," wrote the commander.
"Looks like you don't have a choice," opposite the lead officer.
The White House declared the event "in America" to be an official event and Hatch's law would not have covered it.
But even in official events, there are political subtones.
At that time, the President advocated the health-care reform efforts of the Senate and approved the effort to maintain government regulations.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for a politically profitable purpose is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them for travel.
However, the requirement to use them for a purely photographic session is unusual.
Trump was in February to draw attention when, during his first campaign event in Florida, in Melbourne, his presidential plane was swarming, and his Twitter account is teeming with messages that complain about how his predecessor's president's plane was used.
"The White House is very pleased with the display of" America-made ", where the products were represented from all 50 states, which were manufactured by American workers," said White Houses spokesman acting Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 teams often do flights around Washington and on the southern yard to practice the White House of the President of the United States with centimeters.
When the Trump card in early July in Germany at the G20 Summit was held, the HMX-1 White House in the Courtyard 58 a trial landing.
According to the official, the flight was assumed to be a "America-made" flight crew of that month's training flights.
In addition, the Esframe helicopters flew for 11 more hours on the day, for non-presidential support missions.
According to the White House, no other will burden this event in the taxpayer's wallet.
According to the Sikorsky representative, the company was not involved in the organisation of a helicopter in the southern yard.
HMX-1 does not keep the budget documents of the presidential flights and the exact costs due to the event difficult to find out.
But the defense 2017. In the hourly prices of the financial year, the VH-3d compensation rate is 24 380 USD per flight hour.
In Esframe documents, the flight was noted on its main base from the Navy Quantico, on each route from Virginia, for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is a lot less than that amount.
"The calculation of taxpayers ' costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
' These estimated rates of compensation shall include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs to be taken into account for the annual appropriations. '
According to the 2015 RAND survey, the compensation rates for the Ministry of Defence do not include staff costs, but they cover the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracts.
A White House former spokesman for Sean Spicer defended at that time a helicopter use event.
"The point of the matter is to show this week America-made things," said Spicer.
"And I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut is very proud of their contribution to our national security and that there are presumably hundreds, if not even thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked hard.
So of course it's right to highlight it. "
It is not clear whether the Trump had to touch the helicopter in the south yard to assemble or not the course, but he was sitting behind the wheel of a fire truck.
On the inside of the White House, Trump Sikorsky turned to its representatives and, by throwing the media publications, jokes about the company's products in his private fleet.
"I feel the Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of their products."
The grit Šadeiko-through tears came to peace and joy
The 2011 of Mmil in Daegus was hit in the last area 800 m, and a stretcher was moved from the stadium.
Shortly before that, he had been held in China in the Universita a distant jump to zero.
The 2012 Helsinki EMi violated an injury suffered by the javelin, but in London at his debut, he received 6013 point 23. Place.
However, the unhappiness continued.
On the 2013 of Moscow we had a Estonian record at the end of the day after the opening.
Two years later, he received a 15. A place and filled the Olympiad, but even more wanted the athlete to be disappointing.
The heaviest gaundity passed only last year, when the first EMil was unable to deliver a long jump.
I just want to put together a decent multi-race.
Once ", Confestis Šadeiko.
The worst was yet to come: a month later, her Olympic competition was interrupted by her first barrier due to her thigh injury.
It's time to take off-do the seven competitions continue?
Is the two-day strain still worth everything?
The maiden thought for a long time, but he found peace.
I got my head cleaned out.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I've been thinking that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal yourself and to think clean.
"I knew that the pill I'm not going to put in the bag," says Shadeiko on his self-cleansing.
I was able to turn a clean sheet and go further.
According to coach Anne Mägi, the ward's suffering was very difficult to see, but he understood that the athlete must be in the self-understanding.
He was so down by everybody.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said he would not give up, and he wants to prove to himself what he deserves", says the mountain.
Now he has some kind of peace.
He's going to do it for his own pleasure.
The competition was returned in May, when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record in the Götzise (6280).
In a high-level competition, he improved his personal brand of bullet-breeds by nearly a meter (13.89) and ran a record time hurdles.
Then the multi-contestant felt that it was by no means a ceiling, but deleted only a primary hunger.
The mountain that instructed him for years says that Šadeiko is a musterstudent.
He's good to train.
If something hurts or is wrong, he's going to say it right now.
He feels his body and trusts his senses.
This is the head of the building.
I can't tell you exactly what to do, and we'il follow it.
The new approach has also been found in Šadeiko.
"I'm not the one who's at maximum practice", he says, and says, the most important thing is to get the right feeling, as it will also ensure good results.
Close-to-baby fortune makes you happy
Good emotions have been provided to the shadeikole by the happiness of the loved ones.
His former training partner, Maris Mägi, as Nurse Grete recently became a parent and a multiple competitor has received support from new citizens.
"Quite interesting has been", says Šadeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking equals brain "training".
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is a huge wine fan that believes in-wine can train your brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
What he does is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather as a "very active" wine tasting process.
By sniking the glass, swirling the wine in the mouth, saving it, and when you perceive the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for the wine.
According to Sheperdi, the algae don't actually taste but taste the way in which the wine stimulates the brain.
It brings to comparison how the Brain "sees" the colors.
"The flavor is not in wine, the taste creates a wine tasting", says Sheperd.
Things that are still affecting the taste of wine have an example of our age, sex, and even saliva number that a person produces.
The Sheperd, of course, is dogging that the wine is not to be drunk.
"There has to be more to the action," he says.
If you take too much of a sip, the system is oversaturated.
Excessive wine drinking may damage the brain instead of the benefit-2004. According to the year survey, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, amnesia, loss of balance and reduced mental abilities are risking.

From the Philippines to a wide world or straw bag trip to the heart of the Moefänns
Straw-braided bags are a summer classic, which has been the stand-alone hitch in the last few years, which even has to be hung on the tip of a hand and have been the merchants who have been able to weld in spite of its modest origin. Price tag.
A straw-braided bag is probably one of those things that has existed all the time, and having no special emotions.
It's just there, and if it's not, there's nothing broken.
But now the straw bags are making a real race, and the Moefänns have changed their fine designer bags to a few of the simple straw braided bags.
This is not only a beach bag, but for today it is also popular as a street house and couraguous women even walk into the office.
However, it is worthwhile to make it clear before making sure that this summer look is still sitting or it pays for the wet, and the laptop will push a little more into the official Sumadan.
However, the diversity has made the straw bags the true summer love of the women.
For example, by reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing to do is keep track of the fact that the fashion gourmets are going to be able to get to the local market the first thing in a holiday, and to acquire a beer bag for which the whole holiday is loyal and which comes along the beach. Market, and also girlfriends on the city in the hanging.
Some bloggers are downright so heldeld that buying from the market bags a larger pile and sell or give away them to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that in the case of bags there is a demand among readers, that the real world would go with women (and men!) apparently a hand on each other in order to become a happy owner.
In a way, this madness is understandable, because the rare ones are the times when Moyesterday is able to afford to buy some of the things that have risen up to hitiostaty.
True, clever merchants have discovered a simple monetization here, and so the finer luxury brands are also selling a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Probably still so that richer customers should not feel like a mere mortal, who's going to be in a circle of cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana with more than a thousand euro-paying straw bag.
However, the interpretation of Chanel's straw bag may be a round of 6000 euro.
However, unlike most fashion jewellery, straw sacks do not originate from a few big fashion stories, but their story began much farther.
In fact, the straw bags come from a rather distant Philippines, from which they have a wide range of weather.
The plaice of the straw bag is in particular an export business and the locals are not going around with them very often.
Allegedly comes from the sister's plaiting 14. and is quite charming with ordinary basket.
But as the straw bag does not have to weave as hard as the basket, they can be used to swarm musters and other materials that make the bag more personal and also more akter.
For example, there are recently particularly trendy bags that have braided coloured fabrics or thong stripes.
In particular, the letter of gratitude may be sent to the actress Jane Birkins, who had not been seen as the biggest woven straw-fan.
In fact, he matched a straw bag for all sorts of clothing kits and did not have much to do with it even at the Cannes Film Festival.
It is not a small part of the bag's popularity nowadays, but it is also that caring for them is a head-on, and unlike all the other sumapees, they do not need to be cared for by special means, but also the water and wet towel.
As for the trend-robbing, the brands have come out with all sorts of interpretations, besides the classic look.
For example, you can choose to buy a braided ripper or a tiny shoulder bag on their shoulders.
However, it is worth remembering that the classic straw bag will never go out of fashion, the beer pit.
But what's a classic straw bag?
For centuries it has been a classic kind of straw braided bag, reminiscent of its style in the basket, is open and short, as well as straw, handles.

GMB worries about investment after company McVitie's Glasgow factory
The union expects a cookie manufacturer McVitie's heads to confirm long-term production plans for the company in the Glasgow factory.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent on the business of Tollcross for investment.
There are more than 500 people working in a factory where cookies and other products are produced by hobby and Rich Tea.
Company McVitie's owner Pladis said they have invested an object over the last few years in more than 5 million pounds.
There were hired workers and trade union chairmen "are the first to hear" when something changes in the operation of the plant.
In a letter sent to the company's object manager, GMB Scotland, in McVitie, called for "the devastated concerns in the fact that the facility was not used to modernise production lines".
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot clear the object from the main management with regard to Tollcross's business needs and future investment plan makes our members deeply worried.
The families of many generations have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people in the area of Glasgow, which is an indispensable pillar of decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social The weather.
Thus, in the context of employment, wages and welfare and brext, the rise in living costs and the chronic depletion of production in the background, the companies in the "McVitie" business are in desperate need of a growing productivity. "
The representative of Pladis said: "The Tollcross object was given a letter from the GMB Scotlan only yesterday and the company directly responds to it, because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago a regular meeting was held between the employees of Tollcrossis and the representatives of the GMB, where a number of issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with the staff that, like all other companies with an extremely competitive and precarious economic climate, we look at our activities on a rolling basis and this applies to all our companies and objects, to ensure that our Competitiveness.
He added, "In recent years we have invested a Tollcross object of over £5 million, most of it has gone into production lines and improved operations.
We fully understand Tollcross as a production object heritage, and if there is any change in the subject's activities, the employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear of this. "
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about the approach to Neymar?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up on a quest to attract Neymar's ranks, making his redemption of 189 million in size bid. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record-breaking conquest?
This sound approach has opened the Summer transitional window, and Ligue 1 club is ready to crush more than double the current world record, which was erected last season by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester united with a 89 million pound.
When the transition is completed, Neymar becomes the world's most expensive player and also the highest paying professional athlete in the world, who will receive over 500 000 pounds a week after the payment from PSG.
Barcelona is angry at both the way of approach and the free break of Neymar, although a source close to the board of Catalans confirms that the club is a football player, from its Santocos arrival to the 2013. It always took the best care.
But has the President of the PSG warned the football world for such a chance three years ago?
When Manchester City showed 2014. With the interest in Blaise's funeral award, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the clubs who are thinking about recruiting a PSG player.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will confront them and contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But when they try to contract with one of our players, they must face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have stepped over this boundary as the Spanish club, earlier this summer, showed interest in the PSG centre-player, Marco Verratti.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave on any condition, and that Barcelona might get a rebound in this interest, losing Neymar's form of one of its precious assets.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not boundaries, after brexitit.
"Brexit threatens to seriously hit the wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland", warned the Varadkar at his first visit to Northern Ireland after the inauguration in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made possible the free movement of the current people and goods, said Varadkar.
"It is our vision for the future: to build bridges rather than borders", he emphasized.
According to the thief, he would prefer to remain part of the European Union, and as it cannot be, it will be part of the common European market.
It would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make the United Kingdom more streamlined would be to create a European Union and United Kingdom Customs Union, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, said Varadkar: "We certainly could have this kind of Great Britain."
The alternative would be to return to customs posts that would announce historical divisions and political failure.
"The barrier to trade, prosperity and peace", said the Irish prime Minister.
He called brexitit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its result could affect the everyday life of Northern Ireland in every aspect.
