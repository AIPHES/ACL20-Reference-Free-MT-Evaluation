Four members of the Kemerovo gang were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the postal man, in Spain, the police detained Slava Gulevich, the head of the so-called Kemerovo grouping in downtown Estonia, known as Slava Kemerovski, in the criminal world.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of a court.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects detained in Estonia into custody.
They are suspected to be members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal association between the ages of 27 and 57, who mainly commit drug crimes.
The alleged head of a criminal association was detained in Mijases, Spain's Malaga province.
Three men were detained as suspects in Estonia, one of them being a leading figure in the criminal association according to the collected data, and two are members of the criminal association.
The data collected indicates that there was a clear division of tasks and roles within the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal community's activities was to commit drug crimes and thereby earn the proceeds of crime," commented the head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case, the state prosecutor, Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out increasing the circle of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have previously been caught up in a form of interest by law enforcement authorities, and some of them have been serving sentences for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish counterparts has been a key priority throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," prosecutor Verte commented.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said the detentions were preceded by a preliminary investigation that lasted nearly a year and a half.
"Long-term work materialized in the first half of the week and at the same time we detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that Central Criminal Police officers were assisting in the detention in Spain.
For years now, we have good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we will also get them on the other side of Europe," Leis said.
The information collected so far shows unequivocally that men suspected of being at liberty can continue to commit new crimes, which is why the Prosecutor's Office requested their arrest and approved by the Court.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation in this criminal case.
The pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case are conducted by the Central Criminal Police's organized crime office and run by the Public Prosecutor's Office
The Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of racketeering in 2005 and punished him with five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was regarded as the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after the then suburban leader, Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian downtown in the early 1990 s when he began to deal with racketeering in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes who operated at various hotels and demanded a monthly rooftop tax from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of proceeds of crime and court rulings in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest judgments, the so-called "Dikajev Criminal Community" of eight accused persons who confiscated proceeds of crime of EUR 80 000, or the judgment against nine persons in that Igor Aleynikov set up a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illegal trade in cigarettes and the crime of trafficking in human beings in Eastern Virumaa and southern Estonia.
The confiscated proceeds of crime are close to EUR 71 500.
Success in these criminal cases has been ensured by police officers exchanging information and prosecutors' evidence every day with their foreign counterparts and, if necessary, acting together in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns against travelling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The NAACP travel mark issued by the State of Missouri, valid until 28 August 2017, calls on all Afro-American travellers, visitors and missourilas to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious as they move around the state, given the whole range of dubious race-based events that have taken place recently across the state and also been pointed out here."
Naacp said the group urged the travel warning to be issued by both the recent Missouri law, which makes it harder to win discrimination-related lawsuits, and the fact that minorities are unequally targeted by state law enforcement.
'People's civil rights are being violated.
They are drawn to the roadside because of the colour of their skin, they are beaten or killed, "NAACP Missouri branch president Rod Chapel told The Kansas City Star.
'We've never had such close complaints before.'
This is the first such warning issued by the organisation concerning the US State.
The group cited events such as racist insults at the direction of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died earlier this year in suspicious circumstances after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state and Missouri police took him into custody without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that in the state, black drivers' cars are 75% more likely to be stopped than those of white-collar drivers.
"The comment is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and work colleagues about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be ready, whether that means taking the caucus money together or informing relatives that they are going through the state."
The latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program documented 100 hate crimes in Missouri in 2015, which places the state in 16 th place in the state's cross-section for similar offences.
The travel warning is also in response to Missouri's new law, which makes it harder for the company to sue for housing or work in search of discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union Taj ACLU had issued earlier travel comments about Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because, according to the ACLU, it increases racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have begun to use this measure as a counter-reaction to certain US-based laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what could anyone know about different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different levels of hepatitis A, B, C, D and E.
All of these viruses evoke acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, there is a chronic hepatitis B and C, which can continue to develop into the cirrhosis of the liver, the liver's wrinkling and liver cancer.
Kuulo Kutsar, epidemiology advisor at the Health Agency, says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, fatherhood, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, halal stool, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and the collusion of skin and limestone.
The popular name of liver inflammation also comes from yellow disease.
In children, hepatitis can run without the disease.
Different types of liver inflammation can only be determined on the basis of laboratory study data.
Acute hepatitis can switch to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without disease symptoms, meaning a person may know nothing about their dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Hear Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their course more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from infected human stool to hands and hands to foodstuffs, surfaces, objects, getting into our mouths and consuming drugs.
The risk of hepatitis infection - that is, family members and carers of patients who are at risk, people suffering from chronic liver diseases, people who sex with the infected, men who sex with men, drug addicts, travellers to countries with high hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccinating, in particular by recommending vaccination for people travelling widely and at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, the daily fulfilment of hygiene requirements is important: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruit and vegetables before consuming food.
Hepatitis B viruses spread through contact with the blood of the sick person, injection of drugs, tattooing, August, use of blood-contaminated olphins (toothbrushes, shaving tools), medication with the donor donor, sex with a hepatidic person, and good-faith mother to the fetus/newborn.
Injections of drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men who sex with men, infected mother newborn, sick family members and carers, health care, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, as well as travellers visiting countries with high rates of hepatitis B.
In order to prevent hepatitis b, people can be vaccinated; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, as well as those suffering from chronic liver diseases, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures of hepatitis B include: refraining from using alien hygiene and manicure tools, other sharp tools and needles, tattooing and August, and using a condom in the event of infected sex or avoiding sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan in Estonia and free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses spread through contact with the blood of a sick person, injection of drugs, tattooing, August, use of blood-contaminated municipal objects, donor donor, sex with a hepatidic person, and good-faith mother to fetus/newborn babies.
At risk of hepatitis C infection include injections of drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men who sex with men, infected mother newborn, sick family members and carers, health care, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, people with HIV infection, and travellers visiting countries with high rates of hepatitis C.
Hepatitis C preventive measures include: refraining from using alien hygiene and manicure tools, other sharp tools and needles, tattooing and August, and using a condom in cases of infected sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
This leads to hepatitis D infection with hepatitis B or superinfection in sufferers of chronic B hepatitis.
Hepatitis D viruses spread in contact with blood and other body fluids, contaminated needles, sexually transmitted and rarely infected from mother to fetus.
Hepatitis D is at risk of chronic hepatitis B viral scanders and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses spread through feweight-oral pathways to drinking water and food, including low-heat-treated beef, fish and marine shellfish, donor version, common-use needles and infected mother to fetus.
Travelers may be infected with hepatitis E in countries with high rates of illness.
The preventive measures of hepatitis e include filling hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after taking care of the sick.
Fruit and vegetables wash before consumption, avoid eating little heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and refrain from consuming drugs.
While in the final round the rivals tried to trim the four-time Olympic champion off the track, the 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won 26.49.51 with the time.
Farah did not think long, pulling with her on the track with husband Tania and the children.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful ', Farah told journalists.
Farah is aiming for the fifth title match in London in a row with a 5,000 and 10,000-metre run of golden duuble.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connori's "Ladam in gold. The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer," dives considerably deeper into the cultural life of one of the works of art in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries in Vienna.
But even more deeply into history.
It would have taken advantage of the awe-inspiring information bracket, a tighter axe of curry, a narrower theme that would allow the portrait promised in the title to gain more influence in the extraordinary story.
At the moment, it would be as if there were two books between one of the covers: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, portrayed by Gustav Klimt and her painting "Lady in gold," and the much more extensive and comprehensive history book of respected Jewish families and the German occupation, with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book takes the cultural life of Vienna in the midst of the wedding, and who himself ended up in the Austrian capital, one can imagine how, more than a hundred years ago, life went around Ringstrasse, or how all heads turned in the Central cafe when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and when you see the name you know in the book, you feel as if you are more cultural in the grammar.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where there was an incurable syphilis in flux and was Europe's highest suicide rate, as if it did not add anything to the development of the story.
Or perhaps, however, every couple of honest brush strokes adds colours to the cultural life of the early 20 th century in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19 th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten people in Vienna had a Jew.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice to open up with Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and Klimt for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh-largest bank in the Habsburgs empire.
But Adelet's entire glamorous life, to which she belonged, didn't draw.
Looking at "Ladies in gold," it is hard to believe that, towards the end of life, this great lady infected socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his wife from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt's order paid 4,000 kronor at the time, a quarter of the price of a well-located cottage.
The fact that some of the portraits were suspected of a master's love story with a modell did not deter the sugar magnate.
As far as Adelaide is concerned, the only certainty is that the close relationship between the modell and the artist that emerged during the work continued to the end of life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "A lady in gold.
An extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, a portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer," Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randland.
Just before work began with Adelaide, Klimt had visited Ravennas in San Vitale in basilica, and investigators think that the brilliant mosaics just seen there from the boiling town of Theodora gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adelest as a painted mosaic.
Climt presented his "Ladies in gold" in Vienna in 1908 and around the same time (between 1907 and 1908) another golden painting was born "Siss."
Art historians did not notice the similarity of the two women.
How does Hitler relate to the story?
'I think that by remembering my friend Klimt, I am indebted to him to make his handwork available to the public', wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family's Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had another portrait of the completed Adelest.
Also in her testament (Adele left in February 1925), she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscapes for the Austrian Gallery.
He bequeathed his jewelry to the beavers of Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had graduated from "Austria's Mona Lisa," 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to access the Vienna Academy of Beautiful Arts, but failed at a drawing exam.
Although sometimes Hitler's later anti-Semitism is regarded as the reason that he was not accepted into the academy by Jewish professors, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the function of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in the Maria testament, had changed considerably by 1939, and it had become important to find the pleasant works of Vienna's rich Jewish collections of art to the Nazi Party.
Some of Adele's work at home, but not those of Klimt, were also suited to Hitler's personal art charade.
Sixty years after Nazi art works began a ten-year litigation between the Austrian government and the heirs of Bloch-Bauers.
It should only be noted at this point that if "Siss" is seen at Belvedere Castle in Vienna, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrayal of "Lady in gold" must be seen riding to the Neue Galeries of New York.
And before the Vienna trip read also through the aforementioned book.
Even if you go to look at Klimt's works, there is no plan, because at least my emotions revolved more Nazi and Jewish than the painting sold for $135 million and modell around Adele Bloch-Bauer after the book was closed.
So not so much a portrait, but rather a story of the genesis of the family - and a very moving story.
The geneticist of the Bauers, who was brought away at the beginning of the book, facilitated the orientation of events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to Estonia's record in Canada
In the pre-swing, Gold's own 200 m comeback personal record was very close to swimming at 2.16.62.
The top mark dates back to the 17-year-old pepper a week ago, when the Canadian junior championship was awarded 2.16.58 by the time, Priit Aaviku is brokering Ujumisblog.
Gold got off to the last, or tenth, A-finals.
In the finale, he passed a distance of 2.15.76 and scored a fine seventh place with a new powerful top-brand.
The Estonian record for Alina Kendzior (2.15.13) left Goldi separated in just over half a second.
In Estonia's all-time ranking, Gold rose third, and his fresh personal top mark is the fifth result of all time in Estonia.
The young hope for the future is still taking off in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freeway at the Canadian Adult Championships and in the 200 m and 400 m complex.
The Canadian junior championships were held in Toronto last week, and Gold made successful starters there, too.
He won the 200 m in the freewheeling silver medal with a time of 2.03.22.
So quickly this distance was floated by the Estonians most recently in 2008.
Only Estonian record inmate Elina Partõka has swam this distance in Estonia faster than ever.
The Estonians, who live in Canada, won the bronze medal in the 100 m freeway with an excellent personal record and the top mark of the new Estonian season, 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than him, has floated this distance only one hundredth faster.
He reached the top personal mark by 1.03.69 when he received a letter in the opening exchange of the theatre.
At half-length, he only won seventh place when swimming in the finale at 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season rankings at four different distances.
President Trump goes on holiday, critics sharpen teeth
The holiday time has come - that means relaxation for US President Donald Trump, too.
Since Trump, however, has so far been one of the most holiday days taken out by the president, critics are already sharpening teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president is planning to spend a 17-day holiday at his own golf club in Bedminster, located in New Jersey.
Although the presidential holiday began yesterday, opponents of Trump have already spoken out on the issue of leave for a week.
They are casting too frequent recreation for Trumpi.
Namely, it is customary for the president to spend weeklong time in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villas.
By the way, Trump has not, during his 196 days in office, most rested the president.
For example, George W. Bush reached this time on vacation to be as early as 67 days, with Barack Obama however half less than Trump, in just 21 days.
Trump, though, tends to forget things quickly.
A recited days after becoming president, Trump said sending "60 minutes" to long vacations during his reign time will not stay because very much needs to be done.
He also tweeted outrage about Barack Obama's holiday three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending celebrations and jazz concerts, ISIS journalists are cutting heads off."
According to White House officials, a 17-day visit to a golf club is not really a flare-up.
It is officially called a working holiday instead, during which Trumpi does not have time to read or other entertaining activities.
In addition, there was also a second reason for working holidays.
Namely, the air conditioning system on the West Wing of the White House is being replaced and therefore all staff had to leave it.
The Ovaalkabinet and other presidential premises are also located in the West Wing.
'I don't think any of you would want to be in the West End in August if there's 38 degrees and no air conditioning', said White House spokesperson Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue to work during the holiday.
From where President Trump will spend 17 days following, you get a sense of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook <unk> Don't run for state office if you don't tolerate voter criticism
The father of our country knew a lot about the unfavourable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for the newspapers to begin to haunt him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn't force his critics to remain silent.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "freedom of speech may be taken away from us and, darkly and silent, we may be led to carnage like sheep."
That brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to struggle to be more Washington-like.
Posts from at least 450 people who expressed their views on her official Facebook page have been blocked and deleted by Hogan's subordinates.
And earlier in the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union <unk> ACLU) sued him, therefore.
The governor's officialdom temped the action as null and web commentaries were riddled with counter-reactions in the style of "Who's interested?."
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But it does matter.
And that matters especially much when it comes to a man like Hogan.
The act is an astonishingly popular Republican governor in the overwhelmingly Democratic state.
His approval percentage is the second-highest among the state's 50 governors.
Hogan is not an unthinking reactive dash head.
He has led the State with a firm hand and has remained firmly committed to its principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as a key tool in his dealings with his constituents rather obsessively, for example, by showcasing his fiery head after chemotherapy for the first time.
Thus, on the Governor's page <unk>, a public forum with official labels, managed by staff receiving taxpayers' dollars' pay to block the visiting people is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Amelia Chasse, a spokeswoman for Hogan, defended the governor's conduct in an interview given to The Washington Post, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating.
But it is too easy to paint a picture of internet trolls, junk doctors or a nation full of hate.
The Post chatted with several pretty people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that is exactly what they are, i.e. quite people who interact with their elected leaders. Teacher, company owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not rotten at all.
In his post, the pastor quoted the Bible, oppressing Hogan to Catholicism.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, from maryland Bowie, did not incite hatred, but quite about hate crimes.
"I commented politely that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in The Post's news story in the commentary room.
'I also don't like the idea that when lots of people comment on the same subject, some immediately call it an indifferent collective effort, rather than acknowledging that it's a lot of concerned citizens.'
What the governor's officialdom called a "targeted junk attack," others would probably call "public support."
The Facebook-era allows messages to be easily matched by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than it was in the past when, in order to do the same, workers had to be expelled to gather newspapers with critical letters and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to remain silent.
But that's exactly what's happening now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media sites toothless.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have blocked him from the Twitter stream.
One of the first court rulings on the subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the Constitution's first fix when she blocked a voter from her Facebook page.
Kentuckys visited the ACLU over its use of Facebook and Twitter also after Governor Matt Bevin (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar effect than the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, quadrupled the number of newspapers and anonymous written writers typified his way of governing.
And even then Washington had to contend with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers from pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington decisions to the ground.
According to historical documents collected as part of the online George Washington Letters Project, he buried the cabinet under petitions that criticised his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't force them to remain silent.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
And proper leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for comfort in home territory at Renaissance Club
Former European incumbent Ronan Rafferty is hoping for the comfort of home territory over the next three days when the 25 th Scottish Senior Open takes place at the golf venues of East Lothian Renaissance Club.
The Northern Irishman, who was leading the final round on the neighbouring Archerfield Links runways last year before being outplayed by Paul Eales, is embedded in the new venue and will fill the role of tournament ambassador instead of club founder and chief executive Jerry Sarvad.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built, and now we see the club shining in full glory with this event," Rafferty said.
'The players see the track in their best form, it's in a brilliant state.
Jerry has done an excellent job in establishing this place.
He is a keen supporter of the golf game and is proud of what has been achieved here.
It allows a great presentation of the track. '
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending champion title for the first time, although the man has won both the European Touril and the European Challenge Touril in his 32-year career.
"It's going to be a very special feeling," said the budding player at Southport.
'I couldn't defend my Extremadura Openi title because it was taken down from the competition calendar a year after my victory.
It is magical to come back into this heel.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always bear in our hearts. '
On homeland soil, Gary Orr, who joined the European culture of the Seniors earlier this year when he was 50, will return to the competition.
It will be his first event in Scotland since taking part in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Openil in 2013.
"It's always a little bit more meaningful to play at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.
'You want to do well, but at the same time you also feel an extra strain.
I've enjoyed playing again tremendously and shown a pretty decent game of golf.
I'm happy with the way things have gone so far. '
The trio will be joined on the pitch by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Culture champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the match, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, and car parking costs £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds go to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold-plated land
When Bardina Degei prepares dinner, she does not use the stove.
He even uses pot rarely.
In a wooden house in Enarotal, the capital of Enarotal, Indonesia's reluctant Papua Province Paniai Region, the housewife places a batad called nota in local language directly on the fire level.
In half an hour, the charred comfort will be taken from the fire and the skin will be filled with unwashed hands eagerly.
Degei sits on the floor of the mud, he has no furniture whatsoever and, while there, he also does his daily chores, for example, washing with blurred water from the nearby sex.
The role of the toilet is filled by a bucket of rooftop in the room.
As she is the youngest of her husband's four women, she has not been appointed to look after any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous, however, most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are still soldiers here.
"No one dares to go around the village after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
It is a rare glimpse into life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was merged under Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum that caused controversy, during which only 1026 elderly occupiers were forced to vote by raising their hands before the occupier's troops.
The move, fuelled by the Dutch domination, drew its fury quickly against the Jakarta government, which continues to keep the region under its strong control by deterring foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, so the independent Papua New Guinea remained east of the island.
In order to reach Siia, you must fly 90 minutes from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabires and then take a five-hour journey with a rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city, which has a population of about 19,000, is made up of tree houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by wavy iron roofs, whose rust has turned various shades into yellow-brown ones.
Very few Indians have taken the journey here, not to mention journalists, nor have there been almost any foreigners here.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago's boots worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing clothes like this," Degei says, referring to her colourful hand-woven turban, a dark sweater and a private skirt.
'Before that, we only wore plant leaves on the body.'
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of Asia's worst.
But it is also an Indonesian gold-rich country.
Just 100 km from Paniai, a mountainous province of about New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants, is the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua can pride itself on the supply of timber, which is estimated to be worth USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are the source of the suffering of the sinister, as they necessitate the suffocating presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times showed that Freeport paid about $20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150, 000 to one officer.
The aspirations of the Passover to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are ruthlessly rescheduled.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 children have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass slaughter in the highlands belonging to Papua tribes in the 1970 s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested by Indonesian police in the area.
Birsbank's Archbishop's 2016 "We're Losing Everything" report includes testimony to atrocities committed in the past year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (one other report says rape and electric robbery are particularly common) and the brutal crackdown on peaceful protests.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because such incidents occur every week," says Andrew Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been shut down even more strongly as Papua's natural resources have caused an influx of newcomers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the crowded islands of Jaava, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi in Indonesia.
The family kitchens of the retail kids sell gado-gado-gado with crisp chicken and mixed-furniture fruits, served with peanut sauce.
The locals are unable to compete with them.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market more cheaply than local peanuts," explains Paniais-born 24-year-old Abeth You, who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, for work.
"Indigenous bangs <unk> paapua mama-mama'd [women] <unk> therefore lose their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known among the nation as Jokowi, pledged in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights abuses in Papua.
The former hip-hop won on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace in Papua 29 out of 27 constituencies, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua and the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts have been broken since, in 2014, we voted for Jokowi in the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," You says.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai was languishing in a low state.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang Christmas songs in Enarotal on a flare-up when two Indonesian soldiers emerged on a motorcycle from darkness.
The children who were in trouble told them they should turn the lights on.
According to a story by local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers offended on their voting tone and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, drunk soldiers chased the children and beat them with handguns on their guns.
One of the soldiers then shot into the children's squad.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, was beaten so cruelly that she fell into a coma.
A few hours later, a nearby Electoral Commission building was set on fire and the next day things escalated further.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of a local police station and a military command centre to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting chips and presented the whelps-dance of the Papua honey pago tribe, during which they ran around and hiked the bird's proceeds.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and the military.
As the outrage mounted, soldiers were ordered via an internal radio. "If the crowd points out resistance more than three times, let them down," according to an official document seen by TIME magazine, but not issued to local media outlets.
The elder Yeremias Kayame (56), of the enarotal town of Kego Koto district, felt the threatening threat and called for calm to be maintained, asking the crowd to go home.
No one had the will to listen.
'Turning around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist,' she told TIME magazine in her exquisite colours on the blood of the woodhouse.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the gathered soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, a lot of shots in the costume," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to a nephew who witnessed his shooting.
'I ran up to him and examined him through the body to make sure that it was him,' Yohanes, who uses only one name, like many indonesmen, told the magazine TIME.
'I saw he was dead... I kissed him.'
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only ensured the security of his district as it was attacked.
"We need to protect ourselves if we are threatened to kill," commander Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokeswoman for Papua police, said in 2015.
'It's a matter of life and death.'
Five young protesters were killed and many injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
News of the killings only reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura in which she offered condolences to the families of the victims and promised to address the abuses in Papua.
"I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to address crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately, apologies also followed.
'Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990 s and early 2000 s.
The thing is we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes, "he said.
Speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, however, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying that he had no intention of setting up a mechanism in Papua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, "everything will be settled by law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the bloody 1999 independence referendum, said 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Papua, including what happened in Paniais.
The families of paniai victims accepted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," Yohanes said.
'I'm tired.'
She says she still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
'I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be fired.'
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Paniai are afraid to dissolve the incident.
He said he became stranded by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
"After burying the dead bodies, the military came to look for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot down villagers in Deiyais, a neighbouring region of Paniai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when it went into a war between villagers and the head of a construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man to a hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a fish while trying in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's office at the construction site.
According to police, villagers stoned police officers, with the latter responding with warning shots.
But according to locals, the mobile brigade (Indonesian militarized police) began firing at the crowd, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, we are afraid of retaliation," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the inquests of the injured, told TIME magazine.
'I've been hiding in my house for two days.'
Deiyai's parliament has called for the police officers involved to be held accountable and for the police mobile brigade to be recovered from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the honey, moni, dan and damal tribes living in Papua's landscaping central highlands.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) Taj rebel army, which, according to itself, protects the rights of boat boats by carrying out random attacks and kidnapping raids among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the VPL's leaders come from Paniais, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of "defending the sovereignty of the state," the army has arrested Paniais and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in recent years.
Some of them never turn out again.
Among Papua people, Paniaid is known as a "tragic forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
The lack of rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as elusive.
People grow all their food themselves <unk> mainly bataati, plus a bit of fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom is able to maintain four or five baton fields.
They usually hold most of the harvest for the family, the rest selling on the local market.
Ten bataets cost only 10,000 Indonesian roybeans (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality between indigenous boats and new migrants, who have arrived in abundance since the opening of new routes at Nabire Airport, has deepened.
The few jobs that exist go to better-educated and wealthier migrants.
The parents themselves often lack capital or the necessary skills to conduct competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Paniai tribal council.
The separation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, there are severe restrictions on foreign media.
French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua earlier this year because "they did not follow the relevant practices," although they had been granted rare film permission.
Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division, said Jokowi's election promises to remove restrictions on reporting modes to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"In Indonesia from Papua's most easterly troubled provinces and journalists trying to report from West Papua are threatened by new threats to reject the EgyptAir visa and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a drilling look at the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations - Taj Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - were spurred by the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "a wide range of large-scale crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Paniai.
These same countries have historically supported the VPL as well.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's accusations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "There is still democratic order and freedom of the press in place in Indonesia, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of cases against human rights."
Local people want more foreign governments to take notice.
When the official Dutch delegation, headed by the country's human rights envoy, Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people interrupted their silence, according to a source who wanted to remain anonymous, urging: "We want freedom."
There will be a new presidential election in Indonesia in 2019, but boots do not believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants to make it clear to Jokow that, as well as the people of Paniai constantly living under the threat of a predatory army, they are languishing in misery because of nightly education and health services.
Gobai said that the people of Paniai, like other boots, consider their voice given to Jokowi to be the debt he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai were able to cope with the latest symbolic insurgency; they buried the body of one of the victims in a police station and the land in response to the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be done, at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," Yacobus says with a felled head.
"What else could we do?"
Fire engulfed Dubai's Torch skyscraper for a second time
The fire eaten through one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee this 337-metre high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that has ravaged a high-rise building in just two years, which happens to be called Torch, or Tõrvik Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct fire was lodged on the accrual grounds.
'We slept and woke up to a fire farm and screaming at people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to subdue from the 50 th floor, "one resident, who called himself George, told Reuters.
According to Dubai Civil Defense officials, firefighters extinguished the flame at about 4 o'clock in the morning local time (00.00 GMT) and chilled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for those affected.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the external surface of high-construction sites around the world.
An investigation by the torch board in the wake of the 2015 fire found that the most damage was suffered by the facasate - decorative panels and insulation from the outer surface.
Britain's police have said they believe the insulation and facade panels of London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that took place there in June, which left about 80 people dead.
Watch: These phones will probably become sales hitters in the autumn
Spring and autumn is a sweet time for tech fans, as then phone makers unveil their new top models.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came on sale in the spring, with new hitt phones expected for store chains in the autumn too.
According to Kristjan Seema, marketing and sales director at Tele2, this year's flagship initiatives will be characterised by innovative design, eye-to-edge scissor, edge-to-edge 4K resolution screen and ultra-fast processor.
The tech world's Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the front end of the sales table for Estonian smartphones, sparked great excitement.
Autumn will allow smart loads to be even more fertile, a more durable battery, a better quality camera and greater water and dust security.
He added that rumours could already make assumptions and predict the top four models that are believed to be capturing this year's sales tables.
These top four models of smartphones will still reach the store shelves in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to reach the store shelves as early as mid-September.
The rumours about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it are spreading a lot.
If the iPhone 7 didn't bring spectacularly large differences next to the iPhone 6 s, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to see the new model differentiate entirely from previous ones.
Four colours have been spoken of: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design will probably be a screen covering the entire front panel of the phone, a home button has been lost and a fingerprint reader has been built inside the screen.
Apple's design manager JonyIve insists the new iPhones model looks like a smooth glass.
There has also been talk of a ceramic version of iPhones.
A faster A11 processor can be expected, in addition to an eye-speed shutter, wiring-free charging and a more high-quality camera.
It's certainly one of the year's most anticipated smartphones.
Pre-order of the brand new model Galaxy Note 8 starts on August 23.
Many rumours have been leaked about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It has reportedly been designed even more for the business user, and S Pen allows even bigger functionalities.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which is a wave and the other a TV lens with a narrower field of view.
For now, no one knows what the two rear cameras will be capable of, but in any case, it will be Samsung's first test, certainly comparable to the iPhone 8 in terms of quality.
However, we are looking forward to 23 August.
While Nokia has brought three smartphones to the sale this year, headed by Nokia 6, their flagship store - Nokia 8, which is already being presented on August 16 - is still missing.
We expect a display from Nokia to reach 5.3-inch and ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors and a more resilient battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminium corps and a significant degree of water and dust security in IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear-view cameras, with optics produced by company Zeiss.
While Sony's solid flagship has been the XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We're waiting for a smartphone that's slightly more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least as good or better with a camera.
There has been speculation about Sony's new model that its display will be at least six-month-old.
What reality brings, we can see very soon, because traditionally Sony has unveiled its Autumn flagship at the IFA International Technology Fair, which this year runs from 1 to 6 September.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico over paying for border wall
The Washington Post disclosed transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump went on a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to end the public proclaiming that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president cracked with him for publicly condemning the wall, tweeting, "You're not allowed to say that to the press."
Trump erected his presidential campaign pledge to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts were also published from his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal under which the United States would take on refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous," "chewy" and "stupid." He argued that the deal, made under the Obama administration, would leave him with a "leader card" impression as he has proposed a ban on resettling refugees into the United States.
Trump ended the speech by announcing to Turnbull that "it was the most egregious speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not discuss the complaint made by OÜ MRP Town Line in the case where the city of Tartu rejected their tender for the procurement of the bus transport from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a handwritten rejection of the tender of the Tartu bus contract of the City of OÜ MRP, as the tender did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, Head of the Tartu Municipal Law Service.
This is the procurement of the public domain silin iveo within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
Mrp Town Line referred the ruling of the Tartu District Court to the Supreme Court.
It was not prosecuted by the Supreme Court.
While on social media, many complain that the uproar from the Weekend Festival disturbs their night hours, and the entire city is full of intoxicated bracelets, there are many who do not have any bad words to say about the festival lasting on the beach.
I am even positively surprised that the storytellers in the shop were so polite!
I didn't see any blurred being or insanity.
Even the kindness I saw ', says the Indigenous Wave.
"It is all very well to come, be and enjoy Pärnu, which has remained like a winter feeling," he joyfully adds.
The dupe from the beach in Laine und does not bother.
While living in the city centre, she still heard music being played on the beach, now the music has not yet reached her home intents.
'but I hope I hear', he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who talked to the Master, also tells us that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu - it makes a significant contribution to the turnover of local merchants.
He also rejoices that so many outdoor people have come to visit the summer capital.
The woman is not disturbed by the life of the women.
Although I am no longer sunbathing on the beach, it is nice that the beach has been buoyed.
And it's great that the nation is moving and it's already been that way three times," says the woman.
At first, I think it was a bit worse.
"Then perhaps there were complaints," he ponders.
However, what is happening on the beach, according to him, is common for summer skippers.
'This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town', says Harri, who is headlining in the park.
Melu and möll have not beaten his life rhythm.
But for what?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this interethnic interaction would be better.
The man of loud music is not mushroomed.
It does not stir, even though I live close there.
'Good people can save and there is no mischief', he speaks.
The visitors who came to the estate are, according to him, polite.
"With bottles, of course, they are also a little exaggerated, but young people are young and the Lord god - let's go, but be human and we can handle!" he says.
Coastal residents have traveled somewhere away by then, whether to relatives or acquaintances.
"But overall, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this kind of mlife," says Tiina, who strolled with children in Pärnu.
His family's sleep in festival music is not bothered either, although last year it went even further than this year.
Last summer the lava was the other way around, then we heard more.
We live outside the city, that it is actually quite well costumed far down the river Pärnu," he says.
PEARSON will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut dividends to revive business
British education company Pearson said on Friday it was cutting another 3,000 jobs and cutting its interim flights by 72 per cent, thereby launching another restructuring programme to address the business's threatening predicament.
The losing jobs, which will be laid off as chief executive John Fallon says are highly likely in late 2018 and early 2019, will add to the 4,000 posts lost in the previous restructuring.
PEARSON announced plans in May to cut costs by a further £300 m ($394 million) as part of its third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell a stake in Penguin Random House last month to its partner company Bertelsmann, said their expectation for the year had not changed after it reported a 1-per-cent increase in sales revenue to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, according to officials.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the city's Qarabagh division.
That bombing is the latest in a series of acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people died in the Herat mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people in Kabul near the Iraqi embassy.
A NATO statement said the four-day explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with "a man-borne self-made explosive."
All are injured in a stable condition and are being treated at Bagram airport in the US military hospital, the statement said.
According to correspondents, the growing force of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), in Qarabagh is a serious source of concern for the forces at NATO's Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20 percent of them in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people in a mainly shiite division.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bomb attack in the city center killed more than 150 people - the most deaths led to a military attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
This violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of US troops helping the country's military and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA annulled decision to delay tax rate after lawsuits
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (United States States Environmental Protection Agency <unk> EPA) overturned a decision to delay the introduction of an Obama-era regulation that obliges states to limit smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency because of the move.
The EPA announced the decision to proceed "with the 2015 ozone allocation procedures" late on Wednesday, saying it shows the agency's commitment to working with the states.
"We believe we need to engage in dialogue with partners from our states and to listen to them," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to postpone its ozone management appointments for the pec, which will measure tax pollution in different parts of the country to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to meet the tougher air quality standard.
The 15 mostly Democratic states filed a hag with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, saying the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to pull back a series of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama., according to Trump, it is part of a more comprehensive plan to boost growth.
But those efforts have sparked reactions among Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the impact of increased pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that air inhalation containing ozone "can reduce the performance of the lungs and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases," such as asthma.
German pigs may come to a feast.
German pigs and cattle may come to a feast as heavy rains threaten the prey of the European Union's second-largest wheat producer, Bloomberg writes.
This year it may be the case that weeks of sausage before the harvest may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry only serves to feed the animals.
"The quality of wheat is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
Up to 40 per cent of German wheat could go into animal feed this year, which is double compared to normal, the Finnavis predicted.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all weather this year.
In the first place, winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, replaced by a heatwave in June.
In July, Germany was hit by sauces, which have also continued in August.
Many eyes are turned on northern Germany, where rain prevents harvest.
So far, only five per cent of wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area has not yet started the harvest, reported local harvest buyer Ceravis.
"It's pretty difficult days" in hand, said Frank Deckert of Rendsburg, a senior trader at Ceravis.
Consistency in everything, or the Finnish interior design of the clever fibres
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the fair homes, as, through large windows, the magnificent views of the shores of Saimaa reach many (life) rooms.
Every step of the way is marked by the efforts of our northern neighbours to create both crutches and perfect (energy-saving) homes.
The Finnish wood-use skills as construction and finishing materials, furniture and beauty products are worthy of admiration and adherence.
Stacking techniques and smart solutions are found in the beekeeping houses by both the builder and the (home) designer.
It is there that it is obvious that black, white and grey concealed combinations, if complemented by wood tones and food plants, can be very nice.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, as the fair will last until 13 August.
Accessories and herb pots hint that chefs are often cooked in this kitchen.
On the night against Today, the line was drawn down to this year's Weekend Festival Balticu, and Martin Garrix did his utmost to remember as the last speaker.
The nation was truly at a turning point during Garrix's performance - singing, humming, dancing forgettable.
When Garrix finished, the common mass was lit up from the beach of Pärnu to the city.
We will bring you a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer tried on the Weekend for three days.
Surely you are in some of them too, look up!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are expected to be on a collision course to go face-to-face in the most coughing boxing match of the near future, up to 66.7 kg in weight category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN's office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeatable World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked to the other end of the corridor to greet Lomachenkot, the closing weight champion of the World Boxing Organizations.
After Garcia's unanimous decision led to a victory over former quadruple world champion Adrien Broner at Showdown on Saturday, both fighters are among the top five on the weight table.
Garcia extended his right hand and said: "How do you go, champion?
I wish you success. '
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 19 ESPN.
While the pair poked for the photos, Lomachenko's mountain jailer, Egis Klimas, noted that a possible confrontation between the militants would be a "perfect measurement."
"I'm a former closing weight," Garcia recalled.
'I moved up to [63.5 kg] for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small at 63.5 kg.
I want to move downwards to lightweight.
And he must move upwards of the light weight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fans have liked it.
Let's offer them that then. '
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid to watch it. It is part of his strategy that he wants to let Lomachenko debut in the 61.2 kg class later this year to make a possible meeting next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 darts), who also has an interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbell's match after their September 23 lightweight title series Forumil.
"It could be rewarding to watch this fight as fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said, later saying he was open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
'We are the key players.
No other name can attract so much attention.
Whenever they're ready... '
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a "mighty fighter" and could go to watch his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was subdued in praising Garcia, saying that in his mind the three division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted that darker."
According to Garcia, the goal was to show shock strength and then boxing.
Both asserted that they felt the tension was growing to flourish between them.
'It's a fight waiting to be realised.
No other confrontation generates so much attention and genesis.
I'm more than willing to work on that, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: 'I've been on hold for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It's going to be a good fight. '
Which parts of the world will be moved to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Protection Agency (PPA) extended and issued a record number of over 13,000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia for work, study or family.
For example, when, last year, a fixed-term residence permit was decided to be issued to 6702 foreigners, the figure was 4928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia permanently, but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year a decade ago, in recent years the number is close to 2 000.
The number of applicants for residence permits soared during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014, 1087 people were granted a fixed-term residence permit, up from 675 a year earlier.
According to the statistics office, the number of Ukrainian citizens is the largest increase in Estonia, with 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia last year more than left.
"The Ukrainian community has been great in Estonia all the time, and due to difficult circumstances in the country it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already ahead," said Kristin Rammus, a spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry.
Last year and a long time ago, the number of Ukrainians granted a fixed-term residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, even though, in ten years, the most fixed-term residence permits were issued to the latter.
If the Ukrainians come here to work predominantly, then Russian citizens for family migration.
"Given the historic Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the biggest family ties to people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, a migration researcher at the Homeland Defense Academy.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have obtained a residence permit in Estonia have moved to, after Harjumaa there is East Virumaa," he added, and pointed out that about 40 per cent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received a fixed-term residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit decreased.
"The leap is due to the fact that, instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for permanently moving to Estonia," explained Rammus, a spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia's residence permit has remained stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit to enter Estonia permanently from the previous year.
Its aim is to encourage the exclusion of people who have adapted.
However, a long-term resident's residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has also apparently decreased because of the new residence permit.
For example, last year, this residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians can change jobs, and the Estonian state is no longer pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit became popular at a stroke - applicants last year were still holders of grey passports (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 people received a residence permit for the purpose of moving to Estonia, including, for example, 23 official Germans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and just as many Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When three residence permits were issued to the Nigerians in 2007, 200 last year.
From Nigeria, they come to these universities to study.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of Indian, Bangladeshi and Nigerian citizens has risen largely thanks to learning migration.
For them, too, the rule applies that where the community has arisen, there will be others more easily," Rammus added.
In ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from, for example, North Korea, just as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6,000 third-country nationals get a residence permit per year, that's about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if we consider the citizens of the European Union, migration remains around a percentage," Maasing commented that the numbers are actually small.
According to the statistics office, 14 822 people emigrated to Estonia last year, compared with 13 792.
That means immigration surpassed the second year of emigration.
Most of those who leave and enter are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among those who leave.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was less than 2 000 people last year.
Estonians migrate primarily between Finland and Estonia.
The printing code of Mlong Couturee is fascinated with satses, ticks and bulletins
The bottomless time of ideas, however, is history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours somewhere in a museum and admire old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
If you do something with passion then you study and learn about it every day.
It is a joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mlong Couturee may seem life-alien to some, but the designer doesn't think so.
You will decide how much shine you have in your life!
I have a girlfriend who has a whole sauna full of haute couturee dresses I created.
Because it is not his fault that he does not live in Hollywood and does not go on the red carpet every day, he also wants to wear these most beautiful dresses and heels!
You can live your own life special!
The fashion designer does not recognize the gap between glittering events and grey coward days.
It was this reasoning that set in motion the plan to move high fashion in Estonia to rural areas, between forests and fields, to people who are often not reached by fashion.
The mlong collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvis and Pärnu, where a royal defilee with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, the posture is often taken in, nodded with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere - cries braavo, stand up, want to thank you in hand.
A large proportion of the audience came to be equally newsworthy, but now they are the fans of Mlong Couturee.
When you exceed people's expectations, they are enthused!
And I like the feeling that I am on a summer course with my fashion.
We had a 50-metre red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, it seemed they were not coming to an end!
Maria also doesn't recognize the fashion plan that the creations must be presented by a supersal supermodel; she willingly brings ordinary women onto the stage.
I often invite my own customers to the stage - they have always come with joy.
After all, this is such a grim experience, you can shine on stage in a wonderful dress!
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen my show, I am always behind the stage to give things the last flesh as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve would not be allowed to sit on the floor calmly.
Maria is a fashion designer of this kind, who does not just want to play a representative role, but to be inside everything in hand.
I have a studio with my seam machine, most of the collection I perform for myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, you discover.
I am never far from my creation and I am not afraid of the work.
The design thing is not limited, including stylistics, logistics, organisation, organisation - everything has to fit one temperamental woman's day off.
These working hours are still coming from fanatics enormously.
I can't tell when my working day ends, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an incessant chain of fortune: I do something beautiful, man gets something beautiful and still, in turn, compliments.
It has been said many times that there is magic in my dresses - they make themselves feel like a princess.
The abundant quarrel satsilines that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained the signatory of Mlong Couture to this day.
Martin Entertainment U18 boys: The gun of the Estonians' subgroup tournament was now turned against us
Sorry, the fairy tale ran out.
The first thing was that we did not get our hands on the table.
And when there's such a big difference in the table, there's nothing to do," commented Estonia's U18 basketball boys 61: 75 loss to Britain by our only basketball player in the NBAs, BBC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach Martin Mrentsepp.
Opponents took 28 balls from the attacking table and got so many more attacks because of it.
We were also not prepared for their aggressive defence or attack, it created.
Many attacks by Englishmen ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build up protection.
In defence, however, they were able to hold hands everywhere, we could not combine.
It set the team up from the bottom of its legs.
The opponents' homework was better done.
According to the trademark, Estonia should have made more tactical errors in order to take down the momentum of its opponents in the bud.
In the last quarter - we had zero errors, but opponents already got several quick baskets.
Athleticism and tight insistence, which was at the subgroup tournament our weapon, now all turned against us.
Today we had no strength against their aggressiveness.
The wallpaper was left in limbo with his care in Kalev, Matthias Tassiga.
In the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team, and until now there was a common sense of shock.
It is a pity that such an aggressive opponent had not been met before.
The cup has been confident all along and played his off today but it looked like he was tired - he has been carrying a pretty big burden.
But he made some pretty nice moves that I have seen in the trolls before ', the supervisor added.
Terrible numbers: The maiden basketball team threw less than 10 points at the EM-tournament with three quarters...
It is not only the basketball tournament of the young men's EM B Division in Tallinn that goes to the u18 age class; the girls started the day before yesterday in Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland, unfortunately, tended to be in the realm of antiquities.
Estonia lost 25: 65, but still after the third quarter of the year, it was 9:49, in other words, in the last ten minutes, opponents took their foot from the gas pedal, and the period remained as late as 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia threw 4, third 1 points...
At the beginning of the day, they hit two pieces from the first four in two minutes, and then 25 pieces from the game, then one three in and then another 21 shots along the way...
Perhaps in almost half an hour, one of the 47 whiskies was caught.
In addition, 2 points came from four open risks.
There were a reasonable number of requests with that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland's visual coverage was 33 and Estonia had 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, Portugal 83: 56 rebounds had to be admitted on the opening day.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to replenish stocks
Today, NATO's 1 st permanent mine group arrived in Tallinn for a weekend at a planned port visit to replenish the stock of ships and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships prepare to return to the sea and give crew members the opportunity for a pariah day holiday.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and be ready for future operations to search for historical explosive devices.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the interoperability training they carry out in local waters illustrates our integration with the allied forces," said Arto Reinmaa, chief of the Operation and Planning Division at the naval fleet commander's functions.
Since 29 June, NATO will lead the 1 st permanent anti-mine group, Latvian naval captain Gvido Laudups, who took over the tasks of the group leader during a ceremony in Riga from the Estonian naval officer, Captenant Johan-Elias Seljamaa.
The flagship of the group is the Latvian naval support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, which also operates the group's flagship headquarters.
During this semester, the Estonian naval mine-hunter Sakala will also be part of the international unit.
As one of four groups of ships under the NATO Maritime Command, NATO's 1 st Standing Mine Group is a preparedness unit among the primary rapid response groups, which the alliance can send to different parts of the world within five days.
Between 4 and 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, launched 13 years ago by the Maestro Eri Kid, is being held.
This year's Birgitta Festival, according to Risto Joosti (36), the artistic leader of the Tallinn Philharmonic, will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: Listeners end up in the classics of the opera world include "Traviata" and "Tosca," ballet discoveries from the captivating "Bolero" to the amusing "Karlssonin" and also missing a plan for own production, this time by Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorium "The seasons" was lauded by the same international creative team that in 2015 brought the Pirni masterpiece to the stage.
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre discoveries.
It is larger than any musical theatre in its usual form.
This is a festival whose snow takes hold and never quite lets loose again.
Because the experience that the listener has in this sublime and mysterious environment makes human souls ring and touches human perceptions in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic leader of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't the shoes of the maestro Eri Kid look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klasi, it has helped a lot.
He directed me through my entire student career and also supported the beginning of a conduction career.
Perhaps it is thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue his work.
Various Klas have injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it all spills over to me as well.
It was great to join a team that knows how things are going exactly.
It was the great heart of Eri Kans that gave me the strength to make good progress with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Filharmony.
And here I am now and I can cope!
What could you exhale audiences at this year's festival, what special do you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, by the way, the first ballet written on Astrid Lindgren's narrative comes to the presentation.
To do this is "Karlsson flies."
And one curious nuance to this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed his desire to write this work.
Apparently, he has already had Karlsson's carakter in his soul since his child.
Risto, how do you handle it all?
Thanks to my supportive life partner for sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I am fortunate to have a pile of it.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend so much on other people as on me, in other words, how I am going to meet every new day.
And such conscious toning, holding on to positivity, and actually smiling to yourself in the morning mirror, greatly boosted my fortune.
Especially now this week, when there are the most important rehearsals, I have been particularly keen to practise it and it works.
Smiling to yourself activates the brain and raises tones.
That is not just a buzzword.
I think that people do not yet know half of the things about their body that the universe offers them, but each one will gradually discover it.
Right now, it is an important moment.
Do you also have a ritual before entering the conductor's pulse?
It is still, clothes need to be switched for more convenient ones.
It's this little moment for yourself.
But, generally, yes, I have no chance of rest or a little lull before I make a big appearance.
In fact, I even like to engage actively with people, even before entering a conductor pulse.
But come all to the Birgitta Festival, here's what to discover for not a particularly great friend of opera and ballet!
Watch the mighty video with Risto Joosti!
New results of age assessment tests for Swedish asylum applicants
The most recent results of the test show that more than 80 per cent of those tested were rated older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
Sweden's National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started the tests earlier this year.
The tests were set up to assess the age more accurately during an application for asylum after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of several supposedly underage refugees.
To date, 6880 cases have been sent to testing by Migrationsverket, and the Institute of Judicial Medicine has issued a total of 2,481 test results between mid-March 2017 and July 31.
Eighty per cent (2002) was rated as 18-years-old or older and in another 25 cases, the Institute of Judicial Medicine estimated that the test "could be 18-years-old or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person was "thought to be younger than 18."
Tests are only used when a person's age is in question.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent compared with those of the previous months.
"We don't see a big difference in terms of statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local newspaper.
That much of the cases were rated older than 18 doesn't necessarily mean asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The institute issued 581 test results in May and said there were "indications in 442 cases that the person being examined is 18 years old or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of those 581 tests, it emerged that in 243 cases, the person had directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, whereby X-ray images of wisdom teeth and knee species MRT are performed and then allowed to be analysed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some quarters.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose duties include assessing people's biological maturity to find out if they passed puberty sooner or later than normal.
'I've had reason to think about it and I don't think the measurement method currently used should be used.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, then we shouldn't make the face that we can, "he told Metro newspaper.
But Johan Göransson of the Institute of Judicial Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "Overall, it can be said that the risk of unfolding a child into adulthood is low.
At the highest, or about 10%, the risk is in case a person is a little under 18. '

20-year-old calf-trainer Anna Maria Orel made a fine debut on the London MM, getting a good 18 th spot with 67.37.
Orel was MM's youngest female vasser, and the cheerful woman confirmed she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and got a good experience.
In the first Test (64.80) I immediately made my average result off, in the second (62.80) I risked too much and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," Orel said after the match.
I was looking for my emissions and I am very pleased that I found it.
Anna Maria Oreli's MM debut ended in a good 18 th place.
The rainfall did not interfere with Oreli, as he is training through the TTEC stadium after all.
'I'm scared', he said with a little bump.
The London Olympic stadium had almost a full-house section of the nation, did Orel perceive people around him or could he turn himself off?
I perceived, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says that it gives more - that is what it is!
If you compete yourself, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will be satisfied with MM's debut and he is still awaiting many good matches: "I came here with the 32 nd or last result of this season, I finished in 18 th place.
It is a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and on the MM - that's the only one that counts.
I take a good experience and some days I want to compete for medals already.
West Virgina governor announced party swap
West Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would swap the party.
"Like it or not, but Democrats walked away from me," Governor Justice said.
'Today I'm telling you, having prayed and thought for a lot... today I'm telling you, the Westerners, that I can't help you any more as a democratic governor.'
The celebrations of joy were conquered at the gathering.
"So I will be a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
'As a coach, I would tell you it's time to play another game.'
Trump had promised a major announcement earlier at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the state's only billionaire, turned out to be elected in 2016, according to Forbs.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and the coal business inherited him from his father.
Its value is about 1.59 billion dollars.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) released an announcement Thursday night that "the party swap of Governor Justice is another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather prevent the country from getting better again than working for it."
"With just 15 governors and control over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent cancellation for a party that is casual from the end and cannot find a positive and unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
It is no surprise, perhaps, that where there are many people, there are also many injured.
Mr Urmet, who is in office at the weekender medical circuit, told The Courier yesterday that they had to distribute quite a lot of patches.
Villas and recreations are basic, out of twists and light falls.
Head, back and leg choices, of course, too.
According to urmeti, visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes and so the problems come.
Medics have also had to assist visitors with a couple of more injuries - there have been some panic attacks and also one leg fracture.
We have also done sewing when a person has broken his hand or finger.
The smaller seams we do away with here, the bigger we send to the hospital.

Coe praised Russians' honest apology for doping scandal
Athletics international ninamer Sebastian Coe praised, according to him, "Russia's Thursday honest apology" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country back into sport.
Russian athletics ninamman Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF congress on the eve of the athletics World Cup that his country-imposed match ban was right and he had a firm target to fight doping.
He apologised to "all light enforcement children who have been snapped away by gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain a match ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF president Coe told journalists.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian subunion itself admitted that they had had quite difficult times and were doing everything they could to restructure the subunion."
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for self-reinstatement.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the group's proposal that this is not the time to withdraw Russia," Coe said.
'We've got to do everything we can over the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the spoiled system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian light enforcers who meet the IAAF's strict criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the athletics World Championships starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, the head of the iaafs working group, said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet several criteria for reinstatement.
After a presentation to the IAAF council, he told journalists in London that doping control was still inadequate and coaches who had been banned were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution will make a significant difference to the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
Not only does the electric car revolution fundamentally change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say they will win from one place and lose from the other, smaller mining firms will not help.
For now, Glencore serves from coal and oil, but in the future era of electric cars, cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel demand will grow.
This year, decisions by the governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway, which allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades, have raised the stakes on the spread of electric cars.
So already Volvo has announced they plan to scrap the internal combustion engine, and Tesla will bring a cheaper Model 3 electric car to the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts that more electric cars will be sold in the two decades already than cars using oil-produced fuels.
"In terms of some metals, it changes everything," Simona Gambranini, raw materials analyst at Capital Economics, told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, which have been growing in demand for years.
Electric cars have about three times more copper than conventional cars, reported Glencore.
More copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribasi estimates it will increase copper demand by about five per cent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore is benefiting from a growing electric car trend from rising copper prices and being the world's largest coconut producer, predicted Jefferies Group.
This county company estimates that the other winners in the electric car race will be Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
Cobalt has increased by 70 per cent this year on the London metal exchange.
The bubble price increase was 37 per cent.
Copper has also increased by 14 per cent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's share rose 20 per cent in London, having surpassed rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo Americani in price rises.
On the losers' side, lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine will have to adjust to a new era.
The main end use of the lead is the batteries supplying the starters with a stream of petrol and diesel engines.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless other purpose is found for it, which could overcome a drop in demand" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch metal market analysis manager Michael Widmer.
The lead in the price movement has not yet seen the impact of the loose trend.
Lead has shrunk 17 per cent this year, with it the best metal from a price hike among key industrial metals in London.
Investors will see problems with the metal only in the far future.
"I'm not sure it's so bad for the lead because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars in competition" said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at metal broker firm Triland Metals.
If lead demand falls, it will happen slowly.
It may be that this will happen in about a decade.
In the meantime, tougher exhaust standards mean that demand for hybrid cars, which rely on advanced lead-based batteries for frequent engine launches, will be assessed by the international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel as the lighter car can drive further with less electricity.
This explains an additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium demand for the period from 2013 to 2016.
It accounts for 2.7 per cent of the total world production of aluminium.
That trend is likely to deepen, Widmer said.
Aluminium has increased 13 per cent this year as rising demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel manufacturers are not sleeping.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce baby-friendly car chains.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to withstand the aluminum humum.
"Ultra-strong steel should be the answer to this development," said Exane BNP Paribasi analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to the platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal was worn as catalysts for diesel-engine cars, reported metal finer Johnson Matthey.
"Many of the raw materials currently in high demand such as oil and platinum may not have high demand in the future," Natixis commodity analyst Bernard Dahdah said.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
Plate manufacturers believe continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore chief Marc Grynberg said more hybrid cars would continue to be sold from full-electric cars in 2025.
The big hope for platinum manufacturers in the 10-year run is the hydrogen cell-based cars developed by the Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos, which rely on platinum to generate electricity from hydrogen.
So far, however, this technology has not yet commercially justified itself.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars," said Exane from BNP Paribas, Brunet.
German car manufacturers suffered a major setback in July as a Stuttgart court banned diesel in the hometown of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football's finance rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the rampant spending of European football clubs will not prevent Neymar's world-record move from Spanish football club Barcelona to France club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that dominates the European game and which has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, Paris Saint-Germain is yet to come.
The Financial Rules of Fair Play (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar's transfer was funded without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid €222 million ($262 million) for buying Brazilians out of his contract alone, and Neymar's salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's transfer to the French club.
Psg will no doubt be able to roll out such money to recruit Neymar and add to its star-derived ranks, given that the team is funded by the ruling family from Qatar's energy competition.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out with their own in the football business.
Ffp-le laid the groundwork for Michel Platini after being elected president of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs falling heavily in debt in search of success were actually engaging in cheating and risking ruin should banks or owners give up support.
Since 2011, the FFP will focus on tracking their losses instead of on clubs' debts.
That change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then making huge spending to improve the team and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
Ffp's current three-year valuation period, which runs until 2018, could face losses of up to €30 m for clubs.
And despite Platini being shamefully ousted from the presidential office in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing overspending.
"The ffp is definitely not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," Andrea Traverso, the overseer of the FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid for Neymar's over-purchase clause as a single full pay, they will be able to split that amount for accounting purposes throughout the period of validity of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, making it possible to show the transitional fee over the next five years as a sum of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
Ffp on the first wave of sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with Manchester City belonging to Abu Dhabi, received the worst penalties by their neck.
Psg was fined 60 million euros ($82 million at that point), reduced later to 20 million euros, and the club were ordered to limit the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs who may try to shovel over regulators' financial institutions by blowing up their incomes through companies linked to club owners.
The Qatar company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is deemed to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income.
That was what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority's PSG support was upbeat.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymar's PSG service could come through payments from Qatar to the 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become an ambassador for the World Cup and argue that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a manoeuvre.
The penalties previously handed to psgs mean UEFA will be even more vigilant in relation to any attempts to flout the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed Neymar's transition proactively with PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed as they are not allowed to discuss PSG's situation.
The latest reports show PSG made more than €10 million in profits at a turnover of around €542.4 million during the 2015-2016 season.
Data from the last financial year have not yet been published.
Psg hopes Neymar's arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship deals, commercialisation and spelling.
The club expects a turnover increase of at least 30 per cent when it comes to signing a contract.
In the Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, Neymar tried to block the switch by claiming PSG would be in breach of the FFP with it.
"This is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the country," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to PSG being mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal's mountaineer Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by United's sporting champion, shares the La Liga stance that the country is funding the club.
"This is a consequence of property rights and it has completely changed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
'If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a great player. '

Today 50 years ago: A storm in Estonia that tore roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which raged on 6 and 7 August, caused severe damage, particularly to the Baltic, Harjumaa and Raplamaa.
In northwest Estonia, during these days, wind speeds were over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one tree to another in the garden and tried with his hands to support them.
Everything was blind and ragged, like the end of the world.
Roofs were already flown from the houses on the back of the road, in 2002 the old Mrs Linda Kurova recalled in an interview given to Haapsalu magazine in Estonian Nature.
Linda's husband saw his own planted garden collapse.
But what do you still support the trees with your hands, where do you get against such a storm?
The sea came under the window, water sprayed from the windows," said Mrs Linda, who lived in Haapsalu on the shore street at the time.
That the roads had been filled with trees and the roof of the railway station's perron had flown 20 to 30 metres away, Linda saw most of the shark saluls similarly as recently as the next morning.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were logical on the ground, some completely lying, some half.
It all looked very depressing, the storm walked through the beautiful old trees with rack and crack like a war.
Western Virumaa was not particularly badly affected in August 1967 compared with Western Estonia, but the losses were also high, the Official Journal of Virumaa wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Lossipark and Padise Park were swept from the ground, but the parks of our wearing were also badly damaged.
In Tallinn, wind speeds were measured up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometres per hour.
On the night of 6 August, in Tallinn Sea Square, there was one small piece of plaque shouting: 'Mother, Mom!
The chickens are in the air and can no longer be signed! "," wrote the Virumaa Journal.
The building of the Põll manor in the farmland was destroyed during the storm to such an extent that it was later decided to be demolished.
The Türi ski jump constructions, which were no longer restored, did not meet the August storm.
The Red Star wrote on August 12, 1967, that harvesting towns and settlements from buried trees and their branches is progressing slowly, and residents could participate in the harvesting work.
Fruit fields were also badly damaged in the storm, and the newspaper reported that "party algorials must be both on reorganisation and on fertility plantation for zips and guiding stations."
Hurricanes can be talked about when average wind speeds exceed 32.7 m/s.
The record of inflationary wind wind in Estonia persists from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul measured wind speeds of 48 m/s.
Vaindloo Island was broken by a measuring pattern, so the speed of strong winds measured there could not be accurately recorded.
Clean bathing areas secret: night cleaning and poor beach weather
Colder summer weather also means less harvesting effort in Tallinn bathing areas.
'If there is a weather, people are on the beach, and if there are no, there are no people', says the beach cleaner.
Echo chicks on the beach in Stroom in Northern Tallinn.
They are offered a melodic competition by a tractor burning at low turns, which ploughs down the stripe on the plate.
In fact, the latter sifts through the sand from a depth of seven centimetres, picking out marine litter and the risk left behind by humans: bottlenecks, cigarette accounts and more.
People still come to the beach, regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If there is beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if not, there are no people," says Alexander Usov, chair of the Haabersti Administration beach cleaning works at the Private Company.
At 6.30 am and the beach is undergoing a bitter cleaning job, because at eight o'clock the plats must be fine for people.
Usov has already clocked four o'clock at the working post.
Apart from Stroom, he keeps an eye on the beach of Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pikakari.
Rubbish collections have declined.
Years ago, there was much more of it.
People can now already appreciate what is being done for them," says Usov, who has harvested the beaches for 15 years.
It was the case before that, when something new was put up, it was already broken the next day.
Now it is already being kept what the beach is.
The price of a clean beach
One of the biggest works on Estonian beaches is the harvesting of the sea debris, the adru.
For example, on Pirita beach, this coastal season must be carried away by 400 000 tonnes.
"It's an incredible amount," notes Usov.
The second big category is municipal rubbish, all that people leave behind.
The half-kilometre Stroom beach bar has eight large rubbish containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
So much occurs in rubbish.
However, colder summer weather has meant that rubbish is a fifth less than it otherwise is.
The third species is made up of abandoned things.
These are mostly children's lives.
As a harvest this time, Usov has shovelled a dozen model cars from the sand.
They will wait for the owners on the wooden road leading to the beach.
"They usually come out more, but it's a normal harvest." Usov already knows that soon he will find them again in the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to sink them in the sand again.
Rubbish is scattered
Haabersti Administrative Services spokesman Erika Scholler admits locals are disturbed by the tractor's screening work.
The noise, which runs from night hours to early morning, blends the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
On the day, however, this work is impossible.
In one month, the beach must be screened twice.
'If we don't, the district will fine us', Scholler notes.
But the aim, like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu, is to get Stroom beach under the hallmark of the international blue flag.
"There is much more work in Estonia than in Europe to ensure that the beaches are cared for," Scholler says.
We have more adru and stones and it is harder to sift sand.
But there is less rubbish on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
To hear the beach talk about rubbish, Martin, who lives near Stroom Beach, steps into an unforced conversation round of journalist and cleaning staff, highlighting the beach's current bottlenecks.
In the morning, there is a balcony picture everywhere.
The problem is with the birds and bottlenecks who have pulled the bags of rubbish ', reports Martin.
While it's hard to expect people to be able to change their current behavioural behaviour, Martin hopes the town hall will do something with bins and put a lid on them, for example, to prevent at least birds from ripping up there underway.
Overall, however, Martin is happy with the development of Stroom beach.
It can be seen that the city takes care of it.
It has become more pleasant with children's fields, enlightened and freshly asphinated roads.
It was once the case that the rollercoaster was only able to ride one way," notes Martin.
Treasure fuel finds in Stroomis: coins, only coins
The 40-year-old Dimitri, who combs a metal detector coaster with a metal detector, has had to be exploited during the morning's paddle period.
He does not believe that he will find anything precious today or in the future.
Marine gods are not generous enough to do so.
'I've been dealing with this for a year and haven't found anything valuable so far', reports Dmitry.
As a hobard hunter, in Dmitry's treasure bag, there are some euro coins, bottlenecks and also dangerous pounds that will later be thrown in the bin.
Usually there are still coins.
'gold, rings and so on are not usually', says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at their former level as lacklustre growth and the easing of inflation have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as households' botched incomes have put interest rates on hold.
Policymakers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep 6: 2 rates at 0.25% and fewer members are calling for a rise this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank trimmed its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 per cent and 2018 to its 1.6 per cent and warned that pressure on household incomes would remain as inflation is still expected to rise near 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank also signalled that rate increases will be necessary to curb Brexit-fuelled inflation over the next few years and a higher-than-expected rise in borrowing costs could be needed in financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of a partial withdrawal of the mammoth package to boost the economy launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
The bank will end a fixed-term funding scheme in February that offers cheap funding to banks, although said it now expects a £15 bn increase in offers under the scheme, which is £115 bn.
In minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future as the plight of real household incomes continues to have an impact on consumption."
On rates, it was reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" was needed to ease inflation, and this was "somewhat larger" than expected in the markets.
The stock exchange is currently predicting a first rise in the third quarter of next year and a second rise in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any jumps were step-by-step and limited.
The bank's reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to May's forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for 2018's 1.8 per cent increase remained.
After that news, the pound's rate fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make any changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened growing hopes of a rise in GDP growth of 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
The bank says growth is likely to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it is starting to gather some momentum at the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave households suffering from rising inflation and a paltry pay rise little reason to cheer, saying the situation was going to get a bit worse before the recovery.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent a hit on earnings in the next few years, but a marked recovery in wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The weak pound also spurs the economy by growing demand for British produce, partly compensating for lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were moved to 0.25 per cent last August following a shocking EU referendum that caused the pound to suddenly weaken.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years to breathe full life into prices and the economy.
Ahead of the Bank's latest decision, there was a growing demand for a rate hike as inflation had increased pressure on hard-pressed households; in July, three policymakers called for a rate hike of 0.5 per cent.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, down from 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected and is expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess increase compared to the 2-per-cent target was due to a completely weak pound.
Coreco's head of mortgage brokers Andrew Montlake said: 'Given the recent drop in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is once again becoming increasingly competitive as lenders crave work and hope to finish the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current deals are coming to an end, as refinancing, often without charge and at low rates, has become increasingly popular. "
NHS is prescribing 10,000 people for controversial HIV medication
Patients have access to "transformative" HIV preventive treatment since September, following a battle in the High Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England reported that National Healthcare is now making available to an estimated 10,000 people during the initial three-year clinical trial for pre-exposure prophylactics (PrEP) - a tablet administered before the intercourse, which has shown a reduction in the risk of infection in high-risk people by around 86 per cent.
The NHS agreed to fund a clinical trial after an appeals court upheld last year's ruling by the High Court that the NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite the authority's own claims that the drug should instead be funded by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, hailed the move unveiled on Thursday as a "new sweeping intervention," while the National AIDS Foundation (NAT) described it as a "watershed moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start registering people. There will be further clinics in October before the programme is rolled out across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylactics (PrEP) is a spawning of HIV drugs that are taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Results from clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people with a risk of infection.
Taking prep before intercourse means there are sufficient amounts of certain drugs in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken daily or at the latest two hours before intercourse.
Candidates suitable for treatment include lesbian or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV infected and do not receive treatment.
Clinics identify suitable people willing to take part in a clinical trial, including men, women, trans-gender people and those whose HIV partner does not receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their opt-in at the local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to get the drugs served this week after an international procurement procedure.
The clinical trial aims to assess PrEP's real potential by gathering clinical evidence of who the drug is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: 'This new extensive intervention should complement and amplify the wide-ranging and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of struggle with one of the greatest health problems facing humanity. "
Deborah Gold, chief executive of NAT, said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
Prep, if properly targeted for those in need and belonging to a risk group, offers the chance to change England's HIV epidemic.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England through this NHS-funded clinical trial have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, chief executive of the terrence Higgins Foundation, said: 'It is now a priority to ensure that the clinical trial across the country is put off quickly and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been procured, we are on the way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.
Sharon Hodgson, shadow public health minister, said: 'The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and well overdue after months of delays and dragging the government's feet.
Evidence shows the huge changes this drug can bring to HIV prevention work and ending the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is deployed across the country as soon as possible to protect people who have exposure to HIV and take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society. "
The price of electricity rose by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania it fell.
In July, the difference in the next day's stock market price for electricity between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to €1.94, compared with €7.71 in June this year, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia, the average exchange price for electricity was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour last month, and the price rose 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the system price of the electricity exchange Nord Pool was EUR 26.37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and seven per cent respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, 75% of the hours of the previous month went to Estonia and 16% of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of hours between the two countries did not carry out the next day's deals.
Electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved 99% of the time from Estonia to Latvia, and 73% of the hours used the full transmission capacity.
On the Nasdaq OMX market on the last trading day of July, the electricity exchange price in August could be about 34 and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the cost of generating electricity rose last month, and the transactions took place at a cost of between €5.04 and €5.47 per tonne.
Living high life - half-floor and smart design chips have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a perimeter home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator, swapped her large Knightsbridge home in 2014 against the Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and that Joanne has not wrapped her bags together and sold the apartment further is a tribute to the new design.
'Before that, I lived with my former life partner in Knightsbridge on a much bigger surface,' Joanne said.
'I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I was offering.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and had similar high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day. '
Since the first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a full renewal factor.
At the beginning it was a one-bedroom and sophisticated layout flat - to reach the bedroom had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a half-floor to take advantage of high ceilings.
'I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
Those were my demands, "he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed in Notting Hill to take advantage of 3.8 m-high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development site, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a half-floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach the matter creatively.
"The metal design is quite complex," he explains.
'We had to reorganize the premises so they would be located on top of each other without having to bend.
It wasn't just about building a platform, but we used a steel design to get the height of both the upper and lower space right. '
This positioning enabled Erfani to create two full-height rooms in the room with plenty of dramatic elements.
The semi-floor opens with an old-time left-light Retrouvius window with a view to the glamorous living room beneath the view.
The mirrored golden furniture, silver detailing and retrospective Serge Mouille's luminaire accentuate the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatrical, perimeter and light saturation.
Mirrors have been added to both ends of the short corridor to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the back-seat with a mirror gives the impression of the window opening up to another room.
At the entrance, the mirror capsule offers a deposit for all of Joanne's dining plates and glass requirements.
The living room adds charm to the possibility of closing the kitchen section if not used, creating an image of a more glamorous space.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, the unique fact with this kitchen is that it is a garage-type revolving door.
"There was a bit of design effort going into it," Erfan explains the door of the spooned MDF with steel strength.
'It has a counterweight, which is why it glides very easily when it's put up.'
With the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra meters, an extra bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"After all, the floor space is what you sell - or what gives the property value," Erfan says.
"The real estate agent steps into the outdated form of the room and does calculations based on the area of the floor."
Here they have been able to increase floor space, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"Materials are the ones you're touching and thus helping to create an emotional bond with your home," Erfan says.
'You don't fall in love with the electric cable on the wall.
It's important, but don't make the heart tongue ring. '
It shows that good design and increased surface area help make a pretty ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may even cause a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
Protagonist Dane Jensen is the chief fundraiser in the Chicago skyscraper, who competes with a colleague for an on-the-job performance.
It does not matter other than the amount of money earned, next to which all ethics are forgotten.
His wife and three children are seen by a man only in the early hours of the morning and late into the night.
In the first half of the film, I catch myself from the idea that it is, after all, a version of the business world of "Cardhouse" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's wiretap are similar.
The film goes on, the lesser the cadrimental element remains, and the moralising intention of the filmmakers is increasingly beginning to stand out.
A life-changing experience becomes cancer for the protagonist's son.
The choice must now be made between work and family life.
A son dreaming of an architectural profession makes his father, on his walk to the great buildings of Chicago, think about really important things like faith, goodness, love... without touching even the disaster of the twin towers.
After the third scene in which the son opens his father's eyes, there is a sense that the filmmakers have proceeded from the goal of surely crying the audience, because even the viewer with the most gorgeous heart is unable to hold back tears by seeing the suffering of a beloved cancer-stricken boy.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally understands the morality of his work and does a good thing to an old man looking for work.
Now I am making a bet with myself - if the film has a happy self, I reward my insightfulness after the film with a coffee, if I am wrong, then the scriptwriter can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, the suspicion arises that I will miss my coffee - when the husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man rushes past the palate of the corridor in slow motion.
But the son has grown wonderfully, and even though his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be positive, because now it is time to deal with his family.
I can also feel good about myself - I can predict the end of American drama quite well!
In honor of the truth, the film is well constructed, all the elements needed for it are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, actors are good and morale beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I suppose this film will bring in well.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually get on with it, too.
In this case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the White House's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information reaching President Trumpin, including news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in more pocket water.
Here's the split from reporter Josh Dawsey:
'When the White House's new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, got together with high-ranking officials on his first day in office, he pointed out a key problem for President Donald Trump in the White House, which he planned to solve with the fallout of bad information coming into the hands of the president.
Kelly told officials that the information had to move through him, whether on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information. '
Kelly's diagnosis seems entirely logical, but others have tried it too, and they have failed to tame Trump by tracking his media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television dates back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his television viewing habits have gone nowhere.
"If candidate Trump was dishonest about media coverage after being upset, it paid him to show that he was featured in influential publications also honestly," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that 'according to six former campaign employees, the key to managing Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption also steadily includes the praises'.
Good enough.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter use habits have ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that the rest of us do not know <unk> that Trump's sparkles would have been even more combustible without their interventions.
We will probably never find out about the sparks that Trump did not post.
When his helpers were able to save him a few times from the trouble, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from continually causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, composed of clicks competing with each other, people are exclusively trying to promote their own interests by passing on material to Trumpi that supports their worldviews but may not always be credible.
Throughout the story's run, Politico wrote in May about advisers' tendency to feed strategically questionable information to the president.
One of the examples, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher, is this:
'The current and former Trump subordinates say that Trump may react to negative press, especially with damaging effects on infections, exploding, taking obsession with identifying their source source.
This was also the case in late February, when someone gave a two-dimensional copy of an article on the website, owned by internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walshi of being the White House's "source of several infections."
It makes no difference that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of mocking, or that he did not offer any specific evidence, or that he has made false accusations in the past and withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and began inheriting from subordinates about Walshi. '
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House chief of staff Rob Porter "have tried to introduce a system for managing and documenting documents that reach Trumpin."
How did it succeed?
Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove Priebus to be a more effective leader, but Trump is still impulsive and his helpers are still vying for influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad in the capital are reluctant to obtain permission to appear.
There are many foreigners in the city centre of Tallinn.
Those with whom the Jouyet spoke confessed to playing in the Old Town without the permission of the town hall.
First we found three street musicians near the gates of Viru who had taken the same number of dogs with them.
It was clearly seen that musicians with recreational boots and burst clothes were backpackers, who would be taken off one shower for a berry.
Despite the appearance, the socialite's only woman played a story with an amusing rhythm on the accordion, while one man juggled his side with three balls and invited the passers closer.
A third man had sat next to them on one backpack and smoked a ready-made plaque in the heart.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing nation.
Bob, who played the accordion with Noemi and juggled with balls, was talking about kissing the streets for fun as well as money.
The aim of the company was to collect the ticket money for a ship travelling to Finland on the same day evening.
On the question of whether they asked the city for permission to muscle in the Old Town, Noemi and Bob shook their heads.
Firstly, we did not know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple and most of the time will be granted permits for a month or something like that.
There's no point paying for it ', explained Bob.
When we got back to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw two women being with musicians and chasing them away.
The socialite moved with backpacks and dogs to the Viru Centre roundabout for luck.
There were also three Polish young men on Viru Street, one of whom played fiddle, the other a clarnet, and the third had even carried an electronic piano.
'We're here to provide entertainment for people to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living', explained trio pianist Mivosh.
Mivoshi said they are aware that the town hall's permission must be.
'Of course we don't have it', he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music then there's no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we'll go elsewhere, but try must," he added.
The Bank of Estonia bought bonds for EUR 149 million in July as part of the public asset purchase programme of the central banks of the euro area, while the central bank's bond portfolio grew to a total of EUR 4.36 billion.
The Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases.
The President of the Bank of Estonia, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained in response to a request from members of the Riigikogu that the asset purchase plan of the central banks of the Eurosystem includes three different purchasing programmes: covered bonds in the financial sector (covered bonds), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The Central Bank buys bonds from the market to inspire investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
As a result of purchases, the yield on lower-risk assets is falling, and this motivates investors to take greater risks.
As a rule, under a public debt-buying program, each central bank buys its state government bonds, other state bonds are not bought.
As the Estonian state has not issued the bonds, the Bank of Estonia is doing so-called replacement purchases within the amount allocated to them.
Substitute purchases are also carried out by central banks in countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
According to Hansson, the Bank of Estonia generally buys the bonds of the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
The Bank of Estonia buys bonds as part of the asset purchase program as of March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering bonds were acquired, but the Bank of Estonia will no longer buy Elering bonds from June 2016.
On behalf of the central banks of the euro area, the Finnish central bank will buy both Elering and Estonian Energy bonds from June.
Travellers ignore ditch and return to 'millionaire division'
Some of the West Midlands's most affluent home owners have again come into fierce confrontation with determined travellers who have ignored a council-dug ditch to win back a field away from their villas.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on the field for a wealthy "millionaires division" near the baptized Solihull Street.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks after they were only kicked out there in May without being drenched in a ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactic group found a weak spot in the defence limit, squeezing their vehicles through an unblocked section that had been left to the walkway.
Furious residents have bashed Solihull council, saying the council is "useless in dealing with the problem."
One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after banishing them from Bentley Heath, where they stoned passers.
The council needs to be shamed for taking action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, they were driven away and now they are back again.
They came to last night, probably more today. '
He added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with such things by acquiring long hurdles to protect their parks.
I'm living on the Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy I have to continue paying the council tax if the council can't even block such a thing. '
One local resident, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said: 'It is ridiculous. We have only seen the last of these migrants leave, and a new onslaught is already taking place.
This time the number has increased and the grassland has even seen the horse remember. '
A spokesman for Solihull council said: 'We are aware that there is an unacceptable camp site in the land near Streetsbrook Road, and we are working with Solihull police. We are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
Gathering evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to police by calling number 101.
It helps to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them. '
The weekend festival will be visited by the Minister of Culture, Indrek Saar, among others, who is pleased that the real world's top names have been brought to Estonia.
Asked why the Weekend Festival is so important for Estonians, the Isle answers that it should be asked by all those who enjoy the festival's three-day story in full.
But he says that the real players in his area have come to Pärnu.
"If you look at this level of artists that you have been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre are brought home - this is not often the case in our company," the Minister for Culture says.
Which of the artists at the festival, however, are the ones who speak most of the Island itself?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for old men like me, surely one of the most experienced artist is Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
According to his record, all of us at some point have turned our feet ', he says.
But he still brings out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Our own Estonian players, of course: starting with NOTaj and you can read a whole series of them.
In reality, this renowned concentration of names is very high," he says.

Audi upgrades car manufacturers amid criticism of up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
A day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it was offering software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities including BMW's hometown of Munich, which has considered banning or throttling diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
No company described these operations as a recall.
European car manufacturers have been keen to advertise diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with regulations on carbon emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment to neutralise diesel-emitted exhaust gases will increase for car companies, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under close investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of ringing powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring signs indicating the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which quipped about the use of so-called fraudulent devices, which made it possible to adjust the regulations when testing an exhaust gasoline car, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics sub-unit of the Audi engine development department in Germany was arrested.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may go to trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was pulled into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when authorities accused Audit of installing the system to circumvent European emissions collections' requirements, thereby expanding an investigation that had focused on the earlier United States.
Audi's involvement in the investigation could be a big blow for Volkswagen, the manufacturer of EgyptAir luxury cars generates a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
Estonian schools receive European Union flags for EUR 20 000.
The Ministry of Education plans to purchase European Union flags to Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
In total, the 105 x 158 centimetres of the European Union flag will be awarded to 570 educational institutions.
The flags are designed for exhibiting indoors, they must be performed indoors in high-quality printing technology, also with tunnel confirmation, via the ERR news portal.
On the label of the flag reserve, the text reads: 'Gift to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education, or one flag costs EUR 35.
Journalist's murder highlights growing threat in Mexico
Workers at weekly newspaper Riodoce typically gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug dealers.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They are told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists are discussing which looks safer: either bring the children with them to an office that was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words to a billboard headed by the space: "enemies," "neutral," "allies."
They ask reporters to offer names in every column there is no need for evidence, enough impressions and a sense of inside.
On the payroll of government or cartels, suspected drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists <unk> a whole list of villains making it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
There is no respite from violence, and the more dead bodies are accumulated across the country, the majority of them are journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 at least 25. 589 journalists have been under national protection following attacks and threats, and so far this year at least seven journalists in seven states have died.
The latest deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, though his presence can be perceived everywhere on the facade of the EgyptRiodoce building hangs a large picture of Valdez pointing the middle finger, with the letter "Justice" and two 30 s reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts depicted with his smiling glasses on the face or his characteristic pancreas.
The meeting comes less than two months after he died. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate state prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, only two cases have been prosecuted, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, numbering thousands, the killers of journalists rarely end up in court.
Riodoce's editorial continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data and justice of the murderers, the security meeting, according to Ibarra, will be of little use.
"It's very tobe to waste your time here in the meeting," he says.
"As long as the cause is not known, you will distrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive only a few quarters before he was stopped by two men in the red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which translately means "the twelfth river."
An armed man drove away in Valdez's car and made an accident in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left behind by a woman and two adult children.
Rumours spread freely in Culiacan.
However, there is essentially only silence about Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival clicks struggle to fill the power vacuum.
It makes no difference that on the streets of Sinaloa a few people, or even several, are shot every day, or that the graveyard is teeming with abundantly decorated mausoleums of drug royals larger than the homes of many living.
Let us forget for a moment that peacetime refers to the fact that only one cartel runs the seaside state with precious ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was thoroughly aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and chair of Riodoce, feels tremendous scruples that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes the killing was favoured by two mistakes.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a rival and wartime cartel click with Guzman's sons.
This piece of literature may have angered the sons. suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they arrived in newspaper pieces.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own security after a raid took place in another newspaper editing that reported the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had remained alive for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would exist forever.
He worked as a veteran reporter at Noroeste newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said it was "impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem" in Sinaloa.
The newspaper gradually collected its reputation with bold and honest accounts, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish robust studies without fear of censorship and readers in a snowy print that they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Caboti Award for its Latin American coverage.
That same year, Valdez won the International Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) Prize for Freedom of the Press for her courage to follow Mexico's drug colole wherever it leads.
He openly admitted he was afraid.
"I want to live on," she said, accepting the AKK award.
Last October, he said in an interview given to the television channel Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
'You have to take on the task that the journalist's office is accompanied by Bec's second chance is to play the fool.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't talk about what was going on. '
Riodoce's collective longs for Valdez, a joke who roped like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared embassies and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from office across the road to the El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if her routine love became fatal to her.
His death has also led them to question themselves how best to do their work and stay alive.
'They don't like being stuck with these women, their children, their legal businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs.'
"These things weren't allowed to be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is strong self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspiciously, keep away.
According to Andres Villarreali, editor of riodoce, the problem is that "the brain of smell can be cheated... and that's how this thing happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply to the toxic mix of Tamaulipasis, Veracruz, Guerrero or other states that are home to lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees got together for security training, suddenly mobile phones were no longer allowed; days before that, it was revealed that only spyware sold to governments had been used to track journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers searched for relief from the 40-degree heat under the cover of a tree.
The government appointed them to guard the Riodoce office, located in a four-storey building in Culiacan's middle-class neighbourhood.
Some reporters pondered in half-joking whether these police officers were among the 50 per cent police officers whose governor himself has stamped untrustworthy.
Several months have passed since reporters have travelled to mountainous countryside, where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
Riodoce's edition this week addressed three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement as to who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows about the Taj restaurant is a state of mind for drug dealers as well as the authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered to the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for nearly the entire last century.
More recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption as part of widespread coverage of lawsuits.
Villarreal asked a reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, who was wearing the nickname El Chapo, escaped from a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have been looking for Valdez's column to obtain information from the best sources about the kidnapping.
"In the past we'd already known what had happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose clunky body building has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
'Now all channels of communication have broken down with our sources.'
Valdez's office has become a deposit space for labels and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they could never expect from Taj activists on behalf of the Press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of punches and headed to the local prosecutor's cabinet the next morning for a rally for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A dead body has been found and according to officials, it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists have become more vocal across the country, and as an organised protest criticises the phrase "SOS press" on pavements and buildings.
On that day, President Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to garner international support in the Valdez case for justice.
A day after Valdez's death while meeting with Sinaloa's governor, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because of telling the truth.
After that, he asked for her to be diverted from government coverage of the action, worrying that anger had affected her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "besieged" by organized crime, complicit state officials and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "The Narcotics Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also done at the behest of politicians and security forces who are in cahoots with organised crime.
Media monitoring group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists to police and state officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because you're meant to be silenced," Ramirez said.
Murders obviously have a bleeding effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipasis six years ago.
His dead body was found, along with a letter presumably signed by a cartel in Los Zetas: "I am here for my reports."
Next to his painted head, computer caviator and headphones leaked.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others let on as El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their chair in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels with the headline "What do you want of us?."
Some journalists have fled home countries or even the country.
This is a nerve-racking decision.
It is hard to find work in exile and they still have to cross the streets to avoid the dangers.
And sometimes they are being chased, as is believed to have happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in 2015 in one Mexican apartment three months after being banished from Veracruz.
Those who remain in place and continue to work will have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits he is horrified by the coverage of the drug business.
"Mexico is on its way to hell and that's why I started to be a reporter," he said.
At midnight on one recent Friday, when the latest number had already hit a lock, the editors of Riodoce sat on the pavement in front of the office and looted beer when suddenly everyone's phones began vibrating.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people had died in fire exchanges between rival gangs and security forces, according to confirmed data.
The war continued to escalate, as several messages left by cartels found in the area also promised.
From the same edge of the pavement, reporters lined up the Riodoce website using the news mobile phone.
The front cover of the next day needed a change.
Sirens snuffed along the Taj yet another fire exchange in the area.
Bojorquez beamed at police officers on call to see if they were vigilant.
If they were afraid, at least they did not show it out.
Under a massive portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, with his average finger seen throughout Sinaloale, the Riodoce staff delivered in his footsteps.
"How could one think about shutting down at all," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day Javier was killed, the apprentice asked me to send him to the streets to report?"
Dinosaur used protective colour to avoid foes
At first glance it looks like a shape, though quite scary.
Scientists have now revealed the first findings in relation to the incredible rhinocerousness-sized being discovered by the canada miner, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that the skin covered with its sodomy had a red-brown colour and its past had been somewhat 'sophisticated'.
A report published in the journal Current Biology described the Being as "the best preserved testosterone dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a new type of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of a scratch age, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation stunned researchers who describe it as "truly significant."
This testy-covered vegetarian is best preserved for the type of fossils that have ever been found, according to the magazine National Geographic.
It was found on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he was mining at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that didn't resemble the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossils discovered were sent to the Royal Tyrrell paleontology museum.
The next six years were working to dig the animal out of the 2,500-pound (1,100-kilos) plot.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be brought to the public.
"If you shake a little eyes, you can almost believe that he is asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the Being is exhibited.
'It goes into the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
When researching his skin, researchers found that this plant worker, while covered in sodomy and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely to be significantly threatened by meat-fed dinosaurs.
This dinosaur, with its abundant sodomy, used red and white protective colours to hide from predators, and applied a concealment technique called 'counter-narrative', which is also used by many of today's animals.
This allowed the dinosaur to blend better into the surroundings and avoid foes, according to experts, as the larger dinosaurs probably kept a hunt for him.
This 110 million-year-old family of nodosaurus first arrived at the news in May and is now being visited at the Royal Tyrrell paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now studied the Being and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory at the Borealopelta markmitchell museum, who belonged to a team that spent more than 7,000 hours exposing the animal to painstaking expose.
Thanks to the astonishingly good preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the testicles on the animal's body.
They discovered a counter-narrative - a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, which means that the opposing side of the being was darker than the bottom.
Although the counter-narrative is common, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much larger than nowadays inhabited by countershadowy animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur was actively enough hunted by other muscle-eating dinosaurs, that evolution preferred concealment instead of confrontation as a survival tactic.
But most modern, countershadowy animals - such as deer, mushrooms or armadillas - are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nodosaurus had to make a real effort to survive.
"The vigorous hunting of a dinosaur covered with huge and abundant testicles shows just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the scratch age could have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds of sodomy also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.
Scientists will continue to study the animal to get clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its intestine, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe the dinosaur crashed into a dying river, thereby reaching a stream into the sea, where it sunk its spine in front of the ocean bottom.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and rivers and oceans probably stretched far further inland than they are now.
'This nodosaurus is truly remarkable as she is fully covered with preserved testicular skin, while also remaining three-dimensional, maintaining the animal's original shape,' Brown said.
'As a result, the animal nowadays looks almost the same as in the age of scratch.
You don't have to use imagination very much to reconstruct it - you just need to shake your eyes and it seems like he'd sleep. '
The Cretaceous era was a time when huge, two-legged, muscle-eating dinosaurs - theropots - were floating on Earth.
Although the King Tyrannosaurus rex of them all lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armoured dinosaur may have been hunted down by some of its formidable predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 meter) tall and six-tonne-weighing monster.
Scientists, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was washed into the sea after death and it mumified in the mud.
The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, when he was mining at the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including leather and testicles, and is complete from cones to hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Two 20-inch-tall ora penetrated out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe this sodomy-covered plant worker adventured through the current western Canada until the flooded river in its offshore sediment.
But the seaside burial place of the dinosaur helped to preserve the splendidly detail of its aromas.
The fossilised remnants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that mythical armoured plates along the dinosaur's headlights are still covered by leather troughs.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the journal National Geographic: 'Such degree of preservation is as rare as a lottery victory.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it looks.
The fossilised leather leaves still cover the mythical armoured plates located on the animal's skull.
The right front foot is lying next to him, and five toes are stretched upwards.
I'll be able to count the testicles on his feet. '
How did one activist find an answer to the question "Who's streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a full shock.
Just a day after travelling to New York, this St. Louise resident sat on Airbnb via a rented room on a bed, browsing Facebook on the phone.
He ended up on the post of his former school companion.
It read: "The police have just killed an 18-year-old youngster and he is still lying in the street."
She was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on her stream, which is why she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Posts by the feast @TheePharoah user had been repeatedly shared on his timeline.
A trash par from the area of Louise sent a real-time tweet about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's insane," Ferrell thought of himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
She put her phone away, but saw the sparkle again later in the evening, which this time reported a gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
Photos were shared of a police tape and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and held a tag with the letter "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a real-time stream where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, according to him, penned a gun and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell resembles how he struck himself from the thought: "It's unusual."
""This is not the kind of murder that we are accustomed to and that we could call typical."
I felt horrified at that point.
I was angry and I was crying. '
He booked a return flight and travelled home the next day.
Having landed at 23, he went to his father for his six-year-old daughter and decided they would be driving the next morning to twin Ferguson.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is a central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Who's the streets?"), which will premiere in cinemas on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and shit from the perspective of the people who live in this community and who filled the streets by demanding answers.
When Ferrell, with her daughter - who had a flowery dress in her back and a fitting crown in her head - drove towards Ferguson, they were again chatting about an issue they had repeatedly talked about before that morning - about the experiences of black people and living conditions.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for their rights?" she recalls asking herself.
'We're driving to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right.'
"I couldn't take him along," Ferrell later said.
'What's happening now is... the culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know and see this and grow in the middle of it.
She needs to learn about activism and organisation and, at the same time, get to know the different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we need to do to be free and free.
Even if I manage to bring him up so that he does not personally experience blatant racism, he is no different from some other black girl.
I feel I would do him a disservice if I protected him from this world. '
The first stop they made when they arrived in Ferguson was South Florissanti on the way - from a police station in a place across the road that had become a sort of camp site where activists were waiting for news about police officer Darren Wilson, who was ultimately not charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who was preparing the southern dines.
They put food bags together and helped distribute them to the protesters.
For ferrell, a new type of activism began to slowly take shape.
"My activism completely changed after 9 August," she said, noting that when she was a student at Missouri-St. Louise University, she was president of the Association of Minority Students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
'I didn't have any organizing experience.
It all just smeared. '
Weeks later, Ferrell met one of the film's co-directors, Sabaah Folayan, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was happening.
Ferrell came to mind with the question: "Are you trying to document what's going on or find a story that can be exploited?"
Such scepticism was the result of an unread number of cases in which people - often pain-mongering - come into the community and try to profit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson would not be heard and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already struck hands with fellow director Damon Davis, an artist from the region who was known for activism in connection with death row inmates.
His involvement turned the project into a rope for Ferrell and six other locals, who were watched by the team in the movie "Whose Streets?" after Brown's shooting for years.
"In this documentary, nobody speaks for us or with us, but we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
'It was important to me how these people are portrayed, because that is how I am portrayed.'
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was intended to show that the movement was not about "a redemption manager, but about bringing the community together," as Folayan said - he became the most open participant in the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" is documenting surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as scarring and getting married to his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the ready-made tape.
'but I realized that doing this job and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability.'
What's more, Ferrell's story highlights and replaces the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three instigators, who thought on social media in the wake of the 2012 killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin by the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, are gay.
"In a leading role, black homosexual women have maintained the movement universally," Ferrell said, "and this is precisely because we have to fight constantly on several fronts.
Black homosexual women must bear all this burden. '
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women."
He states, however, that "this is not some sort of thing of creating equal opportunities" - Ferrell was not chosen to be the centre of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who was fuelling the right energy," he said.
'But it's no coincidence that she was directly on the frontline because there's a lot at stake when living as a black homosexual woman at such hubs.
His energy can be perceived through the screen. '
Meanwhile, news cameras have long disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and police remain fragile.
The suspended sentence imposed on ferrell for blocking the road during a demonstration will last another 2.5 years.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere in the region, which she calls home, as simply a "hatchback."
Nevertheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra he has corroborated in memory since he took to the streets of Ferguson a full three years ago.
'It's our responsibility to fight for our freedom.
It is our responsibility to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. '
7 tricks how to get over the pohmellis after the Weekend feast
Some of the more stubborn men, after a feast of scarcity, find themselves in trouble, hence help.
Or proceeds from the saying "avoid a pochmell, keep drunk."
But it's just an inevitable postponement and a proper bladder to health.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning after today's and tomorrow's Weekend's thrall - or other feast - and get over the pohmell as painlessly as possible?
Drink water.
Alcohol down and onto, after a great feast in the morning... or possibly even alcohol instead.
As the body loses a lot of liquids when using alcohol, it must somehow be recovered.
Together with water, mineral substances are also washed out of the body and so it is good to drink mineral water.
Since, after snapping, the sweet is often irritated, it is particularly good if it is soil-free or only lightly gaseed.
Go for a walk.
It would certainly not be worth heading to the grandmother to burst trees - which could prove to be a fatal false decision.
But a light walk helps the body to remember again what it feels like to be alive.
Lambing in a tent and shovelling out a pot is a more time-consuming way of healing.
Give the body energy back slowly and cautiously.
If you are already starting to bark from yesterday's overdrinking, it is certainly not worth trying to load a large fat steak into the liver.
Start with, for example, a fresh juice containing fruit fruits in which your body is located quietly to revive.
If the health of the south already suffers, you could try a wedding train, for example.
And, a little later, the back tank.
Avoid coffee.
This diurethicum releases your body from the last water.
As has already been said: water and juice are your friends.
Don't contribute to painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent a pochmell in the evening, your tax will have to deal not only with alcohol, but also with paratsetamol or ibuprophene and lose both performance.
In this way, you will be even more in breach of your tax and henceforth the poachers will be worse.
In addition, the painkiller does not persist in the body for very long anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it with a pretty empty stomach - it irritates your already battered sweet.
Or if you don't take a partner, you can get along well with yourself.
It affects about the same way as walking, but walking can't orgasm.
But avoid too active pace and exorbitant posturing - the physical effort should be moderate during the pochmell.
Make a joke.
A fool talk with the friends and fellow sufferers of time, make easy noises and laugh kindly about yourself and others (suffering).
Joking and laughter may not drive away the pot, but they will certainly be more fun to tolerate the aftermath.
For once the pochmell goes over anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee are being sought behind as suspects in murder
According to police, a professor at the University of Northwester and an Oxford University employee who has become suspects after finding the body of a man with deadly stabbing wounds in one of Chicago's luxury apartments is searched nationwide.
According to court documents in Cook County, arrest warrants for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathemi and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were issued on Monday with no caucuses because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbing.
The dead body was discovered on July 27, according to a warning issued by a Chicago police station to the community.
Police officers received a phone call and found the victim with multiple stab wounds on his body when arriving at the Grand Plaza apartment block.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was admitted dead at the scene and investigators are treating the stabbing as murder while police are actively searching for the two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a co-professor in microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president of public relations, said in a statement emailed that Lathem had now been temporarily removed from work and had been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal case being investigated by the competent authorities, and the University of Northwestern is cooperating with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant in the finance department of Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and ready to assist the US investigation authorities in any way we can."
In addition, the statement said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wished he would extradite himself.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the Chicago police department of communications, urges the suspects to hand themselves up to authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but we are dealing with defining the exact location increasingly intensively," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to search the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from an administrator at the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had received just a cryptic tip that something had happened in the apartment at No 1008.
According to police descriptions, the scene was a gruesome sight.
Guglielmi said it is not clear whether the event itself also took place on July 27.
Security cameras confirm Lathemi and Warren's stay in the building, he said.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
The Grand Plaza leadership sent a letter to residents saying: "Police are currently working to identify the chronology of events and the victim's background, and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that the act was a family visit."
Start-ups that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure worker satisfaction at his e-commerce start-up, but polls were futile.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse still, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some staff didn't trust the process.
"This system just wasn't consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs the e-commerce company Madison Reed, which sells hair care products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called to the aid of external persons.
A new type of human resources start-ups are emerging to help companies figure out what their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software that is firmly aimed at measuring employee involvement, they allow companies to conduct snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer anonymity to employees and a hot line for lodging complaints, and in some cases allow language publishers to bypass C-level leaders and appeal directly to the board.
"There are now tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
Erretti says he has got a much better view of what his staff think and feel in the three years he has used Glint.
In addition to flash resorts and surveys targeting specific teams, it offers a thermal card for the company, which provides insight into which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing it to identify the causes.
Companies are beginning to understand that they need to stay in touch with their work culture in order not to become the next Uber, which has been embroiled in scandals since a former employee published a blog post that described a harrowing environment in which those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, the desire to have an insight is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation and conformity may be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to data from financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a start-up company based in denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, observed an increase in interest and activity this year amid Uber's dubious reputation.
Convercentil has nearly 600 customers, among them Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered himself as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent lets companies send customized impulse surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, the complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has been anchored by regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and chief executive of Convercenti.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, the company could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and lawsuits, even if regulators don't intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 sites, has used Convercenti for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of rules and operations and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporation's headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find a phone number or email address at the corporation's headquarters, lodge a formal complaint and hope it would be taken seriously.
It was often a daunting and awkward process, said James Vitrano, general adviser to Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no good way to track employees' complaints.
However, now that the company is using Convercenti, problems such as discrimination, harassment or dishonest wage practices, which did not previously reach managers who operated in offices in other cities or states, can be more quickly identified and dealt with.
"I am able to get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of workers," said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we will protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said companies began taking ethical behavior, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, or after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations over the Enron scandal.
But it was only when "social media became mature" that companies realised they could not stop their black lingerie from publicly washing the web.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking periodic fees from companies for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been props for both start-ups.
Convercenti was funded $10 million in February by firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thereby raising the capital collected to a value of $47 million.
Glinti invested $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, raising the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments will come as no surprise, given the interconnectedness between businesses, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that today's workers expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are merely stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy in the company, feel they are being listened to and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, vice president of the Department of General Benefits and Workers' Experience at LinkedInis, which uses both Convercenti and Glint.
Investors are making returns when their portfolio companies are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase the commitment and involvement of workers, it's no wonder they will find support.
Having data on employee involvement is important, according to professional culture experts.
But this data will be useless if the company's supervisors do nothing about it.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can generate expectations that changes are ahead.
And if changes don't happen quickly enough or not at all, it can cause disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consultancy and business management company Kotter International, which has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things aren't brought to an end, the staff are thinking," Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care? ""
Erretti said Madison Reed, who now conducts six studies among staff, has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to restructure several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, will collect new data on workers and it is hoped that in the long term it will bring with it a longer-term commitment of workers in an industry known for its high workforce flowing.
"If you're not committed to ensuring transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
'And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you lose businesses. '
The sparring star of the eurozone is the Baltics: Earnings grow fast
While the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are fast approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes in a reference to the European Central Bank report.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, the total economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
This success is due to low debt levels, fast-improving institutions and business and free-market policies.
"The Baltic States, along with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where real-GDP per capita from purchasing power has significantly approached the EU average," the central bank reported.
Although the goal is for the total economic output per capita to equate to a richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was just 2/3 of the average of 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led baltans to seek better wages from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light, and the economy is also growing this year, the local people are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of people in Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, just under half of those surveyed thought this about their countries' economies.
Ncaa's decision to cancel twice-daily trolls makes Bruins' days long
The clock is almost 23 when a trope of UCLA footballers pauses for conversation at the edge of a new practice pitch on the team's campus.
Some of them have peeled off the back of a shirt, revealing a sweaty back from their workout camp's first-day effort.
For much of the team, these idle minutes offer a midday break.
Players taking part in the summer courses will be heading back to training for the final exams after a three-hour haul before returning to the Wasserman football centre at 6.30 am the next morning.
"The next three days will be a real ordeal for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
Ncaa's decision to cancel twice-a-day trolls to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer - at least until one-half with the final exams on Friday.
For that reason, UCLA's first three workouts were timed to start at 19.15 to fit into the players' already tight schedule.
The switch from two workouts a day means more days with one ace - the start of the Bruins' training camp was elevated to almost a week's forward compared to last season and for the first time in Mora's six Westwood seasons workouts during summer courses.
They have 18 aces in their plans until August 20 before starting official preparation for the opening game against Texas A & M in September.
The MORA says it is in favor of an NCAA rule change, though it adds another item to the agenda in the tight schedules of players.
"They have a huge load on three or four days and that's a serious challenge," Mora said.
'And they're breaking themselves through this ordeal; they're struggling, they're nice young.
I believe that when Saturday arrives and we have more time, it's really cosy. '
Once the camp is over, UCLA's workouts will be closed, which is not an easy task at all, given the clear view of the parking site close to their squares and the sideline Luskin Centre, a higher-class hotel that has already been hit with soccer survivors from the defensive network surrounding the colour mail.
The Bruins players occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted problems could arise with free rooms for the season.
"We are implementing security measures," Mora said.
'It's a real place of concern and it's not exaggerated at all to think people might be renting a room and filming a workout from there.
If you have a record of a workout, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we use a security team there and at the 8 th parking site.
We will do our best by using what we have.
I will try not to worry much about that.
We have a plan in place. '
In retaliation for the Electoral Union of SavisFarm-Ivanova, Kristiina Ojuland, expelled from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljuste, who was forced to resign from ECREA, created for Our Tallinn and for the party children, the Active Tallinn electoral alliance of businessmen, seems to be taking part in local elections this year at least as many political parties in party politics.
The chickens will be counted in the autumn, however, and the key question will be whether there will be enough frustrated voters for all of them.
Who will remain with the Saviscard?
How small the support team of Edgar Savistreasure has shrunk can be guessed from the events organised in honour of his electoral union.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current central political parties and many unfamiliar faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And can the reason why some of the faithful followers and friends of the treasure treasure stand aside from his candidacy in Tallinn be to look for the fact that the "list of treasures" of the business bankers, led by corruptors and suspected corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the rooftop of the municipal government for a Russian-made pop song involving a parent in the Lasnamäe district; and a rudimentary computer game in which the protagonist, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, on the wheel, must avoid the lombs and squirrels that have fallen on the way - is this the way the Central Party is trying for the first time to get the votes of the voters of 16 and 17 years allowed to the ballot boxes?
We look forward to seeing other parties' perceptions of a youth election campaign.
If the viewer of Channel 2 or TV3 watches a black square instead of entertainment, from the beginning of August, there are two options: to accept that in the future only ETV, ETV2, ETV +, Tallinn TV and the English France24 channels will be seen in the freeway, or to surrender to some TV operators every month.
There are probably also those who at first openly rejoice in the advertising-free television experience, but at the end of the day - albeit reluctantly - pay for TV pictures and advertisements.
The deafening music, the noisy nation and the trash left on the streets are the unpleasant side-effects of almost every major music festival.
If you do not want to be part of the melus yourself, however, it is worth discovering the homeland instead of casting your head at home - and leaving the place of sleeping for a hefty amount to the festival guests.
Washington changes green card rules
Media outlets quote President Donald Trump saying a new US immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the green card.
The plan envisages a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and the president supports them.
The bill is going to be debated in two chambers of Congress.
'This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money as it changes the way the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and begin to replace the current program.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the funds to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, according to US media outlets.
Siberian seto young people move to town, pensioners return to land.
Yevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous seto gold miners along the Maana River.
He works from his home 140 kilometres away from the Maana tributary in Kuvai on the outskirts of a gold cartel as a driver.
It is a tough job: two months on, without rest days, 12 hours of work, and then only ten days at home and back again.
During the three years worked in the artellis, Anatoli has seen gold only once.
'There's a hard time: there's a thorough check going in so that the vodka doesn't bring along, and going out to not take the gold', Anatoli says.
Mare Piho chatted with local seto Jaan in the village of Haida, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The archaic culture still preserved in the Siberian sethos is also beginning to affect the home-pigs, because it is just so fabulous, thinks Piho Mare, who studied the most thoroughly distant sethos.
His first research trip to Siberia will be 30 years this year.
During that time he has been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many pigeons did they migrate to Siberia at the end of the 19 th century and the beginning of the 20 th century to gain land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I would argue that 8 000.
I took this out of the story of the Siberian seto men, who have thought about it themselves.
It is difficult to say exactly, because up to 30 people may have come in one group at the time, but the passport was only given to a man.
The passport was granted to only one, but with him were children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look how great the territory was here!
This was many times greater than the historical Setown.
After all, it needed to be educated, managed in some way.
Setod came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture but also to the river (prayer fertilisation), gold mines, industry.
In New Petseri, for example, many of the setod later went to work in the classified city of Krasnojarsk-45 (where the Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P.), when it was formed.
Did the setod form the majority of the population in this region at the time?
Yes, they lived compact.
In addition, the tradition of marrying and having a great many children was preserved.
Seven to eight children in the family were common.
How much did the Siberian sethos culture differ and differ from that of the setocs of the mother country?
They are different, even though what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought with them a great number of popular leaders.
They did their own (folk leaders), but they always made the difference that had been brought along and that had been done here.
Climate change has had a strong impact on the traditional dressing of the pigeons, because it is colder here, after all.
The foods changed.
For example, in Setown, meat was salted, but here it was simply frozen.
Where are the Siberian setode villages and what life is lived there?/graphics: Alari Paluots
The bond with the mother country was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is going to give back there, it is going to affect them.
These girls, who have lived in families here, have listened to amazing stories.
Piho has in mind the people of the Estonian Setode Delegation who came to Haida village on the Day of the Kingdom of the Seto at the beginning of July and lived for four days in their homes - J. P.
What's left here, it's fabulous.
"It's overjoyed to come to the kill and go away as well, because the city has a great location: at the railway intersection and at the intersection of roads," says opera insulist Reigo Tamm from Tapalt.
The city is no longer just a military capital; we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural places, and the seal gets in every corner.
Kill is a top-topp city!
From the city through the rolling River Light, there is a small island where the slaughtermen tend to hold a hunting boat.
'It doesn't look like this beautiful place on the train window', Reigo dares.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in this river because the river is full of sources.
I have been swimming there, I can do it!
The river column can hold the picnic and just make romance - you can watch the river flow and think ahead and behind life.
I have also been there walking with my brides.
The opera-insulist Tamm, apart from everything else, has been on the river shore between three bridges, practicing his treasure sites: "As this place is on the side of the city, no one may come up against it if I round my stories."
"There is a wonderful view of Tapale from the mountain mountain, but there are also health conditions where you can run, get skied and play discgolf now, for example - the golf track is done, the disks can be borrowed from the sports centre," leads Reigo.
The old profiles, of course, go there with their disks, but I have not yet got to play there.
Obviously my colleague Rasmus Kull Tapale needs to be invited to visit because he has experienced a discgolfing player and has disks.
Maybe he will lend me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable from the childhood times of the current opera isolation.
At least during the ski hours.
There are many tears, disappointments left on this mountain and you can in my sporting life.
Not to mention broken bells and skis.
"The entire city centre is currently full of construction works, all this is going to become unrecognisable," praises Reigo.
Tapa's old and tired vaxal building, however, is a very attractive place where summer discoveries are played.
I am pleased that Märt Meos, the head of the R.A.A.A.A.Mi in 2012, accepted my idea and had to make a summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with Aleksei Karenin has just come to an end, on 11 August the railway station is "Living Up," when the old vacuum building is moving around in the 1980 s.
"From 11 to 13 August, the city of Tapa is the days of the open home cafés of a vacuum building and cultural events are taking place in a row, including a folklore," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city just in those days.
In the tiny yellow house on the 1 May wooden front, the museum has been around since 1994.
"The house is small, but there are lots of exhibits and information tremendously," praises Reigo's place, which is full of the history of Tapa City, most of which focuses on rail and warfare.
Reigo reigns that if Tapal goes through all the recommended places, the belly will go empty for a long time, but thankfully the small town is full of cafes.
'We have such good dining places and sitting in cafes sometimes you get the feeling that you're abroad', she describes.
Well-educated and young soldiers who have come to Tapale spend a lot of time in pubs and cafés, so there is a fascinating feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home town, but there is such an international community together.
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to the stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we are moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
BTV, the television channel, quoted the foreign ministry as reporting that two Bulgarians were taken into custody in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of 1 August, police arrested a group of people illegally camped on the Sithonian Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but an investigation is currently under way.
The Foreign Ministry told TV channel bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone who skips holiday in a place not intended for that purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The court could impose a fine, according to the ministry.
Wolves who teach puppies are about to break sheep.
After a year of pause, farmers in hiiumaa will again have to give their shepherd "educational material" to the wolves - wolves who have apparently taught puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep on three occasions, with a total of 23 sheep and eight injured, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the number was only three, the year before 124.
There are also data from the Environment Agency that there were no wolf baskets in Hiiumaa and information from the Hiiumaa hunting council that two wolf factories have been fixed on the island this year.
On the night against Monday, wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in Emmaste Municipality and injured half of the 18 survivors of the sheep.
In the early hours of Wednesday morning, wolves broke one sheep in a pasture in the village of Reheselja and badly injured another, who had to be hit with an emergency cardboard.
The rules for the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Department of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOVS) and amending the Plant Protection Act to the Coordination Circle.
The amendment of the law renounces the creation of a separate database for both GM (GM) crop locations and handlers, using a plant health register in the future.
In addition, the obligation for a GM crop handler to have a prior agreement within a prescribed radius with a beekeeping person will be modified.
Although there are currently no GM crops cultivated in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and non-modified crops.
This is at least as long as there is no decision to declare Estonia GMO-free," Sigmar Suu, head of the plant health department at the Department of Rural Affairs, said.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors," Suu added.
The draft law repeales provisions relating to the database and treatment training of GM crop locations and handlers in GMOVS, establishes requirements for the handling of GM crops and the commencement of economic activity.
In particular, with regard to beekeeping, the current obligation of the GM crop grower to inform beekeepers about starting cultivation of GM crops is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before starting cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to examine this in the draft information system and, if they so wish, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The proposed changes will affect, in particular, those active in the field of plant farming, beekeepers and the Agricultural Authority.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize MON 810.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in cultivating GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no land lawyer in Estonia, a European corn lab, for which MON 810 is resistant.
The varieties of this maize line have also been bred to the southern regions, and this corn is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In order to obtain certainty of the above, the Department of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in seeds of various varieties of summer, maize and soya cultivated in Estonia.
Analyses of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain alien gene, and the study concluded that seeds of varieties of rapeseed, maize and soya grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that GM crops are not being consciously cultivated in Estonia, and it was also confirmed that there had been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Maticu in form of 'genius'
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited Nemanja Maticu in the form of a "genius" after making his debut against midfield player Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, bought over from Chelsea for £40 m, started in Dublin Unitedi's last pre-season game before the Uefa Super Cup final against Real Madrid on Tuesday with a 2-1 victory in the sub-division, impressing in the defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go in the attacking moments.
But having been sidelined by the Blues' pre-season Asian culture, Maticul desperately missed a matchup form and held on for only 45 minutes, which Mourinho says must be improved from a firm before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he has the mindset of football," Mourinho said.
'We will help him achieve form as soon as possible.'
Like Matic, other new recruits Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku began under-grivism at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho began quietly putting his eleven starting men in place by the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed the club had already done a "great job" by signing contracts with three of his four priority selections.
"I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three of the four," he added.
'I'm still happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me.'
Another nose son got his foot in the GSM presenter on 1 August and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird observer who lives in his fingers, the first son of the month was equipped with the Sõrves, and this laundry is already flying around, has left the wash site and has joined the large overnight collection of Mullutu-Great Bay.
This is because there are no fruit fields in the Sõrves, the Voice of the Islands writes.
This Tuesday, relatively late for the rings, another monthly son became attached to the sender and this was on the island of Muhu.
Martinson said the installation of the attendants was actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a monthly son called Mati GSM was supplied to Sõrves Turkjul.
'His activities are all viewed on the Internet: how he went to Spain wintering, coming back for a long time on the German-Polish border and then came to Saaremaa', Martinson said.
British inventor allowed to install a microchip in his body to get into the house and car with a handgun
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could simply open his front door, get into an office and even run a car with a handgun.
33-year-old Steven Northam was allowed to install a tiny chip between his thumb and name finger, and is now also offering the service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals looking to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, consultant-anesthesiologist at the Royal Hospital of Hampshire County in Winchester, to ensure the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip mounted on cats and dogs, and it takes just 30 seconds for the procedure.
Northam's company is also swapping house and car locks to make them compatible with a chip, asking for £300 for one lock.
This married father of one child has installed the technology by now both home and in his car in the BMW Z4, which gets underway when his hand is on the wheel.
White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands
According to military documents disclosed to the magazine TIME, the White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter cost taxpayers as much as $24, 000 for an event celebrating American production last month.
Green and white paint Sikorsky VH-3D, dubbed Marine One during the presidential boarding session, was the centrepiece of the event promoting American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials revamped industrial products from all 50 states on their tour.
The helicopter, built in connecticut, was exhibited along with a hunt from Main, a fire-fighting car from Wisconsin and a two-lift truck made in Mississippi.
According to documents from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House military office called for a helicopter presence with the department command, or FARGOs, to be narrowly 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern yard for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually high-profile event," the HMX-1 commander said a day before the event in an email to his boss, the deputy of the Navy's chief officer in the aviation industry.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at the southern courtyard for an event starting at 7 a.m. on the morning of July 17 and remain there until the yard is cleared between 18 and 21 on the same evening.
Added was the fact that if there was to be a delay in leaving the White House, the return flight would need a second parade because of restrictions on working time.
The original flight crew was at a helicopter during the event, and the squadron's security team remained near the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to read out from the documents given to the journal TIME whether the second extraction was eventually needed or not.
Hatchi's law prohibits federal employees from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether this event could violate that provision.
"We asked if it was violating the Hatch Act, and we were told not to violate," the commander wrote.
"It seems you have no choice," the deputy chief of the lead officer replied.
The White House declared the event "Made in America" an official event, and the Hatch Act would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The president backed the health care reform efforts that had been under discussion in the Senate at the time and praised efforts to keep government regulations in check.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents need to use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for photosession is unusual.
Trump got into the spotlight in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, rolled onto the background of the president's plane, and his Twitter account is riddled with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the display of "Made in America," where products from all 50 states made by American workers from American materials were represented," said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokesman.
Hmx-1 teams often make test flights around Washington and in the southern courtyard to practice catching up with the sentiment precinct of the President of the United States to the White House.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, the HMX-1 White House hosted 58 samples in the courtyard.
According to the official, the flight was believed to be among the norm for "America-made" flight crew during that month's training flights.
Squadron helicopters flew an additional 11 hours on that day for "non-presidential support missions."
According to the White House, none of the other exhibits of the event overwhelmed the taxpayer's purse.
Sikorsky's spokesman said the company was not involved in organizing the exhibit on the southern yard of the helicopter.
Hmx-1 does not maintain budget documents for the president's flights and the exact costs of the event are hard to figure out.
But according to the Defense Department's hourly prices for the 2017 financial year, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24 380 per hour of flight.
Documents from the squadron noted the flight length of its main base from Navy Quantico Airport, Virginia, on both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House claims the actual cost of using a helicopter is well below its amount.
"The calculation of taxpayers' costs based on estimated benefit rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated benefit rates include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that will be taken into account for the annual envelope."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Defense Department's compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but cover costs related to fuel, maintenance and contracts.
White House former spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the time at the event.
"The point of the matter is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
'And I know Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud to be contributing to our national security and that there are expected to be hundreds, if not even thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So of course it's right to highlight that. '
It is not clear whether Trump came into contact with a helicopter as part of an event in the southern yard or not, but he sat behind the wheel of a fire-fighting car.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, poking fun at media outlets about the company's products in his personal aircraft park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - through tears arrived peace and joy
The 2011 MMil Daegus hit Šadeiko in the last area, an 800 m running leg ramp, and the pipe was taken away from the stadium with a delivery frame.
Just before that, he had received a zero in distance jumping from the universe in China.
The 2012 Helsinki EM was marred by an injury from a low-cost injury, but at the debut Olympics in London, it gained 23 rd place with 6013 points.
The misfortune, however, continued.
Moscow MM in 2013 received a thumb injury after the opening day in the Estonian record schedule.
Two years later, he won 15 th place on the Beijing MM and filled the Olympic storm, but that too was a disappointment for the athlete who wanted more.
Only last year, Šadeiko passed through the heaviest loss, when he did not receive a letter of result at first in the distance leap from Amsterdam EM.
I would just like to put together a proper multi-match once.
Once upon a time," Shadeiko ran.
Worse was still to come: a month later, his Olympic qualifier in Rio was already sealed at the first hurdle because of a betrayal injury.
The time had to be taken down - did the seven-match run run at all?
Is two days' effort still worth all that?
She thought long, but she found peace.
I got my head clean to think
It's relatively hard to describe this experience, but I've thought last season and Rio Olympic were something that just had to happen.
Luckily, there was time to heal yourself and think your head clean.
'I knew I didn't put the pills in the bag yet', Shadeiko talks about his self-cleaning.
I was able to turn a clean sheet and move on with a new momentum.
Coach Anne Nagorno said it was very difficult to look at the suffering of care, but she understood that the athlete in particular had to come to terms with himself.
After all, he was so grounded by everyone.
It was hard to tolerate.
'The grit, however, said he doesn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth', says Mountain.
Now there is some peace in him.
He does it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the Götzis multi-match.
In a high-profile contest, he corrected the personal top mark in the bullet court by nearly a metre (13.89) and ran a record-breaking time in a barrier race.
Then the multi-promoter felt that it was not a ceiling of ability, but that only the primary hunger for competition had been extinguished.
Nagorno, who coached him for years, says that Shadeiko is a black student.
He's a ready athlete, he's good to coach.
If something does trouble or is wrong, he says it immediately.
She knows her own body and trusts her sense.
That is what we must do.
I cannot say exactly what needs to be done and we will follow it.
A new approach has also been found by Shadeiko.
'I am not the one who makes the most of the trick', he says, and he says that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
Loved ones' baby bump makes joyous
Good emotions have also been offered to Shadeiko by the good fortune of the loved ones.
Both her former training fellow Maris Nagorno and sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-racer has received support from new weather citizens.
'It has been quite interesting', says Šadeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking equates to 'training' the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is outright such a big wine fan that believes - wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
In his words, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the 'very active' process of tasting wine.
By sniffing the glass, sipping the wine in the mouth, enjoying it and perceiving it as an aftertaste, we are putting our brains at work to create a taste for wine.
Sheperdi said the wine molecules don't really contain taste, but taste occurs in the way the wine stimulates the brain.
She brings in comparison how the brain "sees" colors.
"The taste is not in wine, the taste creates a taste of wine," says Sheperd.
The things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender and even the amount of spit that man produces.
Sheperd, of course, admonishes that wine is not in order to drink full.
"There needs to be more" in action, he says.
If you take too big a limp, the system is oversaturated.
Excess wine drinking can do harm to the brain instead of benefit - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity.
10% of Estonian ICT sector workers pay less than colleagues
Data from recruitment firm Fontes reveals that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than their colleagues.
The ten% pay gap is between men and women, writes Geenius on the portal.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the Fontese ICT sector pay survey.
A total of 8 577 posts were examined.
63% of posts were employed by men.
"Although only 3 companies said that the pay gap is in favour of men and that there is no pay gap for the rest of the companies, in reality, compared to similar works among themselves, the basic salary for the men's month is on average 10% higher than that for women and the total annual pay for men is on average 8% higher than that for women," said Ilmar Nordjala, an analyst at Fontese.
'narcose' 3 rd season promotional clip: Now that Pablo Escobar has gone, the Cal cartel will take centre stage in Netflix's hitch series
Despite revealing Pablo Escobar's killer in the second season of "Narcose," the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth season has been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first has already been completed with a promotional clip that delights the series with new villains.
In its third season, the DEA will turn its attention to the world's richest drug business organization - the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers "like a Fortune 500 company," simply with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) with this brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) leads ties with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a newly released promotional clip, Pedro Pascali is seen returning to Javier Penana, a figure recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement to help in the war on drugs.
Other new actresses include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "narcose" will become the opening story on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the UN mission to Afghanistan said Wednesday that elections can only represent the nation if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said hundreds of women were standing in local council elections, three women standing for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate by emphasising the importance of the role of women," she said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and can only be credible if women are fully involved and involved in all phases of the electoral process.
Local council elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
For its part, the Taliban have threatened an electoral process that coincides with a transition period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisable.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is calmly transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysomi says the strong role of women will boost the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
Of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women, according to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission.
The joy of sharing makes every thing fiercer, both large and small.
There is always too little time in common, but the trenn with the bushes gives a good opportunity to combine interaction, play, proximity and load.
And what a convenient solution - no matter where you cruise in the summer, you will always be accompanied by a living hanty, and you will be anxious to remember with your fine-tuned voice: "Let's do the trolls now!"
Start with the heat - it is very good to have a normal game of gold or to flag along the beach bar.
The rock is the bedrock of standing in the form of feet and ash - who would then like to take the shape of the sandcake washed from the waves over the summer?
It is wonderful to use a lever instead of children!
Firstly, it is safe and comfortable, the difficulty is slowly growing at the same pace as the force of the coach.
Those who have advanced can also make hacks with quite large children.
The child is training in balance, reading repetitions and feeling the fun of being able to speak high and be important.
At the same time, larger children can make their own pockets.
The scope of the movement is determined by the touch of the earth and the straightening of your hands.
Keep your fingers straight, ask you to keep your miniabic neatly shut.
The child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
The plank is a superfluous but hopelessly boring exercise for the child.
But it's easy to make fun of it!
Game-plank: Take a long plangucolon from which to wade through.
Actually harder than usual, but much more fun to do when in the meantime you can hand a friend.
To add a load, you can keep a plang, a small turf, and you can walk around in that position.
For extra months, you can sit on the hips of a little child, but this exercise offers fun for all children.
While the crabs sip in the sand, the drizzles, ash and belly plants get a load as if they were infectious.
The child descends on his feet so that his body size is distributed equally in advance and behind.
Security can hold your hands.
Curve your legs and stretch straight up.
The bladder can fly, have fun, train the balance and be difficult.
The life of a small coach is extracurricular when he gets a little mess at every turn.
The additional burden gives the browsing of your feet in advance.
Check that the spine remained in a neutral position.
The children themselves have much more fun to make belly sharks in pairs and with plaque.
Hand work and pulse slick.
Trace the child's safety, knee position, and keep your back in a neutral position.
Favourite and great fun of all children!
For the older while truly effective the whole body of the trenn.

From the Philippines to the wider world, or the Teachbag trip to the heart of fashion fans
Straw bags are a summer classic, which has become an own hitch product in recent years, and one of the right souvenirs has to hang out at the hands, and to which traders, despite its modest origins, have been able to spring up the price tag for the hitter.
A straw-red bag is probably one of the things that has existed once in life on a regular basis and has not caused much emotion to possess.
It just exists, and if it doesn't, then there's nothing broken either.
Now, though, beer bags are making a real winning turn, and fashion fans have swapped their fine designer bags for summer months for simple straw-bred bags instead.
It is not only a beach bag, but today it is just as popular as a street bag, and the courageous women even walk into the office.
At this point, however, it is worth making clear beforehand whether a summer look like this to the boss is still sitting or whether it is worthwhile pushing the riot and laptop to a slightly more formal sump.
However, the richness of the altercation has made beer bags a true summer love for women.
For example, when reading foreign moeblogs, the first thing that stands out is that fashion motorists are the first thing on a holiday home to grow into the local market and acquire a few beer bags, which are then faithful to the whole holiday season and which accompany the beach, the market and also girlfriends in the city cradles.
Some bloggers are downright so lavish that they buy a bigger bunch of bags from the market and sell or give away them to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting, however, that the demand for bags is so high among readers that women (and men!) in the real world would probably pass on each other a hug to become the happy owner of a few bags.
In some ways, this madness is also understandable, because it is rare for a fashion show to be able to buy for a few ten euros a thing that has risen into a construction status.
It is true that the clever merchants have also discovered a simple way of making money here, and so the finer luxury brands are selling apple bags for a few hundred and a few thousand euros.
Probably still so that richer customers don't have to feel simplistic, who are prominating around with some cheap bags.
For example, you can buy a beer bag costing more than a thousand euros at Dolce & Gabbana.
The interpretation of the chanel beer bag, however, could be worth around EUR 6 000.
Unlike most fashion buildings, however, beer bags do not come from a few large fashion houses, but they started from far away.
It is claimed that the beer bags originate far from the Philippines, where they have spilled over wide.
Straw bagging is primarily an export business there, and the local ones are very often not seen going around with them.
Admittedly, the apple coaching technique dates back to the 14 th century and is quite sarane with the usual cork-punching.
However, since beer bags do not have to be as heavily redacted as a basket, they can be combated with musters and other materials that make the bag more personal and, by that, more actractive.
For example, recently there are particularly trendy bags with colourful panels or leather strips.
Above all, however, beer bags can be sent to Jane Birkin, the star of the show, of whom the largest redacted beer bag had not been seen before.
Namely, she matched a beer bag to all kinds of clothing kits and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
The popularity of the bags nowadays does not play a smaller role, but it is also the case that caring for them is a dry head and, unlike all kinds of other sumadans, they do not have to be cared for by special means, but also water and a wet towel.
As with the trending initiatives, brands that have come out with all kinds of interpretations apart from the classical look.
For example, if you wish, you can acquire a straw ridicule or a tiny bag of oils.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic beer bag never goes out of fashion, but it is a piece of beer.
But, what is the classic beer bag then?
For centuries, a straw-red bag that resembles a basket of its style has been regarded as classical and has been cut short, as well as straw, sangs.

A man missing three days ago on island island was found
The treasure left his home on Wednesday night in an unknown direction in Kärla's downtown.
The arega had last contact by phone last night, Friday night, and the positioning of the phone provided the man's location in the West Isle parish, the village of Mblowers, from where he was searched by helicopter to midnight and with his dogs until early morning.
His phone then got his battery blank, and the whereabouts of the man could therefore no longer be identified.
Police continued searches this morning.
Police thank everyone who contributed to finding Aare.
Gmb worries about investment in firm McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union is awaiting confirmation from the leaders of cookie manufacturer McVitie's over long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
Gmb Scotland says the company has remained silent on the future of the Tollcross object investment.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
The company's McVitie's owner, Pladis, said they had invested more than £5 million over the last couple of years.
More workers were hired there, and union chairmen "are the first to hear" when something changes in factory activity.
In a letter to the company's object manager, GMB Scotland's company, McVitie, appealed "to address concerns that the facility will not be used to modernise production lines."
Gmb senior organiser Drew Duffy said: 'The fact that we are not getting clarity from the object's chief executive about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plan is deeply worrying our members.
Multi-generation families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow, as an indispensable mainstay for decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social weather shortages.
So, in terms of jobs, pay and well-being in the east of Glasgow and against a backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic depletion in production, a thriving yield business in McVitie's is sorely needed. '
A spokesman for Pladis said: 'The site manager of Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will respond directly to him as we value active communication with workers and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting was held in Tollcross between employees and representatives of the GMB, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: 'In recent years we have invested more than £5 m in the Tollcross object, most of it has gone to production lines and improvements to operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as an object of production, and if there should be any change in the activity of the object, the workers and the trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it. '
Did PSG warn Barcelona about the approach to Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won't give up on trying to lure Neymar into his ranks by making an offer of £189 m to buy him out. but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record conquest trip?
This hardline approach has opened the summer transfer window, and the Ligue 1 club are poised to crush more than double the snubbing of the current world record set by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for £89 m last season.
Once the switch is completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, who will start receiving more than £500,000 a week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona are, of course, outraged by both the way of approach and breaking Neymar free, although a source close to Catalansi's board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi heavily warned all clubs thinking about recruiting some of PSG's best players.
"I don't worry because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will stand up to them and make contact with those players," Al-Khelaifi said.
'We respect all clubs.
But if they try to enter into a contract with some of our players, they have to face the consequences. '
Barcelona appear to have stepped over that limit as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG's midfield player Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
Psg made it clear that they would not let the Italian leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could get a setback as a result of that interest, losing one of their expensive assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit.
"Brexit seriously threatens to drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned on a first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.
'I can't imagine who would benefit from it', he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders," he stressed.
Varadkari said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and because it cannot, remain part of the European single market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to streamline Britain's departure would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the UK, the Irish prime minister explained.
Noting that such a deal existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "Certainly we could have such a Britain."
The alternative to this would be a return to the customs points that would herald historical division and political failure.
"A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace," the Irish Prime Minister said.
He called Brexit "a challenge for our generation," and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of daily life in Northern Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister met leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when visiting Belfast.
Märt Avandi, who passed his first half-long triathlon: Ironman is able to pass by anyone.
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltic States was held in the winter capital Oteavl, when about a thousand triathleets from more than thirty countries entered the quasi-long Ironman competition.
The 70.3 mile distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, Märt Avandi also triumphed in the first triathlon of his life.
'I thought it would turn out to be difficult and in the end it was difficult', Avandi concluded.
Despite the complexity, Avandi acknowledged that, in fact, the triathlon is a fitting head for everyone.
'Not the distance kills, but the pace kills', he said, hinting that with the knock-on pace, almost everyone ends up in the finish.
Except Ott Sepp: "It's fine with Oti's physique, but alas he can't swim."
Avandi had been keen to do the trolling since February.
Early 4-5 hours a week, but later ten hours a week.
With time 05:34:12, he won 270 th place in the overall count.
Although Avandi lost both to Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and to Jürgen Lig (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called "prominents in class" contestants.
Tanel Padar, who was a "good example for the family zone" last year, lost to Avar in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18 respectively).
The German, Johannes Moldan, was crowned with 3:58:27, while the Estonians had the best Ivo singles time in 04:14:09.
Among the women, Dane Helle Frederiksen triumphed with time 04:24:01, while the Estonians beat Maria Ja, who lost to Frederiksen in nearly half an hour and was defeated by the time of 04:58:58.
Avandi completed a 1.9 km swimsuit with 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
Out of the water, he came in the 410 th position.
