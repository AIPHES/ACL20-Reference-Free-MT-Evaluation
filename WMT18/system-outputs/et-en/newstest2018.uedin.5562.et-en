Four members of the Kemerovo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimehe, the police in Spain detained Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian alliance, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects detained in Estonia into custody.
According to the suspect, they are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal community, aged between 27 and 57, who mainly commit drug crimes.
The alleged leader of a criminal association was detained in the Malaga province of Miami, Spain.
In Estonia, three men were detained as suspects, one of whom is a leading figure in the criminal organisation, according to the data collected, and two are members of a criminal organisation.
The data collected suggests that tasks and roles were clearly distributed in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal organisation was to commit drug crimes and thereby generate criminal revenue, "commented Vahur verte, head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case.
"We do not rule out increasing the circle of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have also been in the interest of law enforcement authorities in the past, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of this cooperation," commented prosecutor verte.
Ago leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said the detention was preceded by a nearly one-and-a-half-year preliminary investigation.
"During the first half of the week, long work was carried out and, at the same time, we detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that central criminal police officers were assisting in the arrest in Spain.
For years we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These detentions are another message to criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe, "leis said.
The information gathered so far makes it clear that, when they are at large, men who have been suspected can continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecution requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting his surrender to Estonia.
As part of this criminal case, property, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings of the criminal case will be carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organised Crime Bureau and will be led by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich in 2005 of blackmail and sentenced him to five years' imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was regarded as the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world, after the then allied leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Kemerovost, rose to prominence in the Estonian alliance in the early 1990s when he began to deal with extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes at various hotels and demanded a monthly umbrella charge from business men.
International joint operations, confiscation of criminal proceeds and court rulings that have entered into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest court rulings, the eight indictees of the so-called Dikajev criminal organisation, seized â‚¬80,000 in criminal proceeds, or a court ruling against nine persons in the case that Igor Aleynikov set up a criminal organisation in 2006.
The amount of criminal proceeds confiscated is close to EUR 71 500.
In these criminal matters, it has been a success that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with their foreign counterparts on a daily basis and, if necessary, carry out operations in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement read: "The NAACP travel notice issued by the State of Missouri, which is valid until 28 August 2017, calls on all Afro Americans passengers, visitors and Missourians to be particularly vigilant.
NAACP said the group's travel warning was prompted by both the recent Missouri law, which makes it harder to win cases of discrimination, as well as the fact that minorities are disproportionately targeted by state law enforcement.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are drawn to the side of the road because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP Missouri branch, told The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had such close complaints before." "
This is the first such warning the organisation has issued for the US state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults toward black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died earlier this year in suspicious circumstances after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state, and Missouri police took him into custody without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than those of white men.
"The note is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
'People need to be prepared, whether it's about taking bail money or informing relatives that they are going through the country.'
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state on the 16th floor of the state in terms of the number of similar offences.
The travel warning is also in response to a new law in Missouri that makes it difficult for the company to sue for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Association (American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU) had issued earlier travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to other countries, but recently interest groups have begun to use this measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different - A, B, C, D and E hepatitis virus.
All of these viruses provoke acute inflammation of the liver.
The malignant cost, however, is chronic B and C hepatitis, which can develop into liver cirrhosis, or liver cortisol and liver cancer.
The health agency's epidemiology adviser, Kuulo kutsar, argues that acute hepatitis disease is the same for all types of liver infection - fever, fatigue, diarrhoea, vomiting.
The last hour of the disease also comes from the popular name of liver inflammatory disease.
Children can have hepatitis without disease.
Different types of liver inflammation can only be determined on the basis of laboratory study data.
Acute hepatitis can switch to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without disease, meaning a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver disease.
The Kuulo cutter brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from one person to another and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sexy, from infected people to hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, mouth and drugs.
Family members and carers who are at risk of hepatitis A infection, people suffering from chronic liver disease, people who have sex with an infected person, men who have sex with men, drug users, A hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccinations, in particular, vaccination is recommended for people who travel a lot and people at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: Wash or disinfect your hands before using food to wash all fruit and vegetables.
Hepatitis B viruses spread through exposure to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tissue, augmentation, blood-contaminated household items (toothbrushes, pregnancies).
People at risk of hepatitis B infection include injecting drug users, sex partners of infected people, men having sex with men, infected mother's newborn, sick family members and carers, blood and other body fluids.
People can be vaccinated to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, as well as people suffering from chronic liver diseases, HIV infections, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
The other preventive measures for hepatitis B are: Refrain from using strangers' hygiene and manicure tools, other acute tools, and the use of syphilis-needles, tattooing and augmentation, and the use of condoms in case of a dangerous sexuality, or to prevent sexual risk.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation scheme in Estonia and is free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread through exposure to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, augmentation, blood-contaminated household items, donor blood, hepatitis.
People at risk of hepatitis C infection include injecting drug users, sex partners of infected people, men who have sex with men, infected mother newborn, sick family members and carers, people with blood and other bodies.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: Refrain from using strangers' hygiene and manicured devices, other acute tools, and systalls-needles, tattooing and augmentation, and the use of condoms in case of an infection.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
D hepatitis is caused by the D hepatitis virus, which is revealed in the presence of the B hepatitis C virus.
This leads to the presence of D hepatitis B with hepatitis B or superinfection in chronic B hepatitis C patients.
D hepatitis C viruses are spread through exposure to blood and other body fluids, contaminated with syphilis-needles, sexually transmitted and rarely infected mothers.
Those at risk of hepatitis D are chronic B hepatitis C viruses and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person from being infected with the D hepatitis C virus.
E-hepatitis viruses are spread by fetal coral through drinking water and food, including low heat-treated beef, fish and sea shellfish, donor blood, joint-use syllabuses and infected animals.
Passengers may be infected with the high incidence of E hepatitis in countries.
E-hepatitis prevention measures include compliance with hygiene requirements: Wash or disinfect your hands after walking in the toilet, before cooking and eating, after taking sick care.
Fruit and vegetables wash before consumption, avoid eating little heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption.
Although in the final round, the competitors tried to beat the four-time Olympic winner off the bench, the 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final and won with a time of 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long, pulling her husband tania and children on the path after finishing.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the path with them was wonderful, "Farah told journalists.
Farah targeted a fifth title race in London in a row of 5,000 and 10,000 metres for the golden duo.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connori's "lady gold." The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait, is much deeper from the beginning of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna's cultural life.
But even more deeply in history.
Perhaps the more thoughtful curves, the narrower theme, would have allowed the extraordinary story of the portrait allowed in the title to have more effect.
At the moment, it would be as if there were two books between some of them: Gustav Klimt and his painting 'lady gold', the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a much more substantial and comprehensive history book, along with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book, in the midst of the wedding of Vienna's cultural life, and who himself found himself in the Austrian capital, can hardly imagine how life went on around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the wealthiest cities in Europe, and when you see the name familiar in the book, you feel like a grammar culture.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud operated in a city where there was an incalculable syphilis and had the highest level of suicide in Europe gives nothing to the development of the story.
Or perhaps, however, every odd brush attraction also adds colours to the cultural life of the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna.
Dream trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten inhabitants of Vienna was Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice to open up to Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and Klimt for her famous paint.
But Adele's whole glamorous life, to which she belonged, was not drawn.
If you look at "Dame gold," it is hard to believe that, towards the end of life, this great lady was infected by socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his wife from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painting artist in Vienna.
Klimt's order cost $4,000 at the time, a quarter of the price of a good-located rural house.
The fact that some of the portraits were suspected of being a masterpiece with a sculpture modelle, the sugar magnate was not deterred.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the modelling and the artist created during the work continued until the end of life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "lady gold.
The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait, "Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randland.
Just before work began with Adele, Klimt had travelled to Ravenna in the San Vitale basilica, and investigators believe that it was the brilliant mosaics from the Emperor's Theodore that gave the artist the idea to make a golden portrait of Adele as a colourful mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Dame gold" in Vienna in 1908 and, around the same time (from 1907 to 1908), he was born in the golden land of "kissing."
Artistic historians did not go unnoticed by the similarity of the two women.
How is Hitler involved in the story?
"I think that in the memory of my friend Klimt, I owe it to him to make his hand work available to the public," wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after the artist's departure.
Six years before his death, Klimt had produced a portrait of Adele as a teenager.
In her testament, too (Adele left in February 1925), she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscapes to the Austrian Gallery.
In her jewellery, she teamed the ensemble with a pair of strappy heels for Marion and Luise.
A year after Klimt had finished "Austrian Mona Lisa," the 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to get to Vienna's Kaunite Art Academy, but failed in the drawing room.
Although sometimes the reason for Hitler's later anti-Semitism was that Jewish professors did not take him to the Academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in Maria testament, had changed noticeably by 1939 - it was important to find pleasing works from the rich Jewish art collections in Vienna.
Some of the work at Adele's home was also suited to Hitler's personal art property, but not those of Klimt.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year legal dispute began between the Austrian government and the heirs of Bloch-Bauer.
At this point, let's just note that if "The novelty" is seen in Vienna's Belvedere Castle, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait of "Dame gold" will have to be seen to travel to New York's Neue Gallery.
And before the trip to Vienna, read the aforementioned book.
Even when you look at Klimt's works, there is no plan, because at least my emotions revolved around a more Nazi and Jewish theme after the book was shut down than the $135 million sold-out funeral and modell Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much a portrait, but rather the favorite story of the sexes - and a very moving story.
The Bauers family tree, which was introduced at the beginning of the book, greatly facilitated the orientation of the events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In the living room, Gold was very close to the personal record of his own 200m seaside swimming pool at 2.16pm.
The top spot comes from the 17-year-old pizza a week ago, when the Canadian juggernaut Championships got a time of 2.16.58, brokered by Prior on the avid news blog.
Gold escaped the final, perhaps a tenth of the A-finals.
In the finals, he went through the distance with a time of 2.15.76 and reached a good seventh place with a new powerful top mark.
Of the Estonian record belonging to Alina Kendzior (2.15.13), Goldi stayed in the division for just over half a second.
In Estonia's all-time ranking, Gold rose to third, and his fresh personal top mark is the fifth result of all time in Estonia.
The young hope of the future is yet to start at the Canadian adult championships in a 100m, 200m and 400m free-kick and a 200m and 400m set-up.
The Canadian junior championships were held in Toronto last week, and Gold made a successful start there, too.
He won the 200m free-kick with a silver medal time of 2.03.22.
So quickly it was swamped by the guerrilla of the District, most recently in 2008.
More quickly than ever, only the Estonian record holder, Elina Partyka, has slept in Estonia.
The defending champion in Canada won another bronze medal in the 100m free-kick with an excellent personal record and the top mark of the new Estonian season at 56.66.
For example, the older Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than him, has only slept one century faster.
As a personal top scorer, he reached another 100m in the semifinals, becoming a batsman in the opening weekend of the tournament with a time of 1.03.69.
At half-time, he only reached seventh place when he scored in the finals at 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the ranking of the Estonian season in four different dishes.
President Trump goes on holiday, critics sharpen teeth
The holiday time has come - it's a relaxation for US President Donald Trump.
Since Trump, however, has so far been one of the most criticized by the president on holiday days, critics are already tweeting.
U.S. TODAY and CNN reports the president is planning a 17-day holiday to spend at an owner-owned golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president's holiday began yesterday, Trump's opponents on the holiday have spoken out over the weekend.
They look too frequent for Trump to relax.
Namely, it is customary for the president to spend the weekend in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villains.
By the way, Trump is not the most cleaned president in his 196 days in office.
George W. Bush, for example, arrived at this time on holiday for 67 days, with Barack Obama half less than Trump, just 21 days.
But Trump does tend to forget things quickly.
In a tweet days after becoming president, Trump said by sending "60 Minutes" that there will be no time for long holidays with his agent, as there is a great deal to be done.
He also expressed outrage over Barack Obama's holiday three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time: "While Obama is on holiday, playing golf, attending celebrities and junior concerts, IS journalists are cutting their heads off."
According to White House officials, the 17-day golf club visit wasn't a kind of relaxation.
It is officially called a working holiday, during which Trump has no time for reading or other pro-Trump activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for a working holiday.
Namely, the air conditioning system in the western wing of the White House was replaced, and that's why all the staff had to leave.
The Oval Office and other working rooms of the president are also located in the West Wing.
"I don't think any of you would like to be on the western wing in August if there's 38 degrees and no air conditioning," said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue working during the holiday.
From where President Trump will spend the next 17 days, you get an idea of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't stand for state office if you don't tolerate voter criticism
Our country's father knew a lot about unfavourable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers did not last long to start dazzling him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, annoyed him.
But he hasn't forced his critics to quit.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "freedom of speech could be taken away from us, and in the dark and quiet we could be led to slaughter by sheep."
That brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who is struggling to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who published their views on his official Facebook page.
And earlier in the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU) therefore complained to the court.
The governor's office slammed the action as trivial, and online commentaries were cuddled with counter-reactions in the style "Keda interested?"
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But it matters.
And that matters especially when it comes to a man like Hogan.
The act is an astonishingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His approval rating is runner-up among the state's 50 governor.
Hogan is not a thoughtful reaction to the fixture.
He has led the state with a firm hand and has remained strictly committed to his principles.
In addition, he has used a rather fabulous Facebook account as a key tool in dealing with his constituents, presenting, for example, the first time since the chemical attack, his girlfriend's head.
Thus, the Governor's page, which is a public forum with an official label, managed by staff who pay taxpayers' dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's conduct in an interview with The Washington Post, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing but modeling.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of online trolls, scammers or people full of anger.
The Post spoke with several pretty people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that's exactly what they are, quite people who communicate with their elected leaders. Teacher, company owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not at all rosy.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing Hogan's Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, a lawyer from Maryland Bowie, did not apologize for the anger, but for the pretty hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in a commentary on The Post's news story.
"Nor do I like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same subject, some immediately call it an indifferent collective effort, rather than acknowledging that it is a large number of concerned citizens."
In what the governor's officials called a "targeted ransomware attack," others would probably call "public support."
The Facebook-era allows messages to be easily matched by simply blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much cleaner than the old times when, in order to do the same, workers had to be sent out to collect newspapers with critical instructions and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to quit.
But that is exactly what is happening now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official to be criticised for tweeting on Facebook and other social media outlets.
President Trump has been taken to court by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter stream.
One of the first landmark judgments on the subject was made last week in Virginian.
U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the chairwoman of the Loudoun County Review Board violated the Constitution's first amendment when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) after using Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, affordable postal spending had a similar effect than the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers and anonymous letters dazzled his leadership.
And even then, Washington had to contend with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers from pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington decisions on the ground.
According to historical documents picked up as part of an online George Washington letters collection project, he was buried in the cabinet under petitions that criticised his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he did not force them to quit.
Freedom of expression, differences of opinion and debate are the foundations of our country.
And the right leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for comfort of home territory at Renaissance Club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for the comfort of home territory over the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place at the East Lothian Renaissance Club.
The Northern Irishman, who was in the neighbourhood last year with Archerfield Links in the final round ahead of Paul Ealle's downfall, has been knocked out of the new venue and will play the role of the club's founder and chief executive, Jerry Sarvad.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built, and now we see the club shining in full glory at this event," said Rafferty.
'The players see the path in their best form, it's in a brilliant position.
Jerry has done a great job in building this place.
He is a keen supporter of the golf game and is proud of what has been achieved here.
This will allow the path to be presented excellently. "
The Englishman is ever looking forward to being able to defend the championship title for the first time, although the man has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's going to be a very special feeling," said the coaching player at Southport.
'i could not defend my Extremadura Opening title because it was taken a year after my victory on the competition calendar.
It is magical to come back into this box.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will forever bear in our hearts. "
On home soil, Gary Orr, who joined the seniors' European Tour earlier this year when he turned 50, will return to the competition again.
It is his first event in Scotland since attending the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Opening in 2013.
"To play at home is always a bit more meaningful," Helensburgh man Orr said.
'You want to perform well, but at the same time you also feel extra pressure.
I've been hugely enjoying playing again and shown a pretty decent golf game.
I am satisfied with the progress so far. "
The trio will be joined on the pitch by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Test champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scottish players in the competition, the rest of them are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance is free, and car parking costs Â£5 for a car with one passenger and Â£10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds go to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold-rich land
When Bardina Degei prepares for dinner, she doesn't use the lead.
He even uses a potty selfie.
An Indonesian apartment in a wooden house in the capital of Papua province's Paniai regent in Enarota puts the housewife in the local language nota's inviting bathroom directly in the place of fire.
After half an hour, the dusted mug is taken from the fire and poured into the skin with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on a muddy floor and has no furniture and, at the same time, does his day-to-day household work, such as washing washes with water from close sex.
The role of the toilet is filled by an unlocked room.
As she is the youngest of her husband's four women, she has not been appointed to take care of any of the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
However, working late can be dangerous, most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are still soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," he says.
This is a rare glimpse into the life of a former Dutch colony that was submerged in Indonesia in 1969 following a referendum that caused controversy, in which only 1 026 elderly people were forced to vote before the eyes of the troops.
The move prompted the Dutch supremacist movement to move its outrage quickly against the Jakarta government, which is still keeping the region under its strong control, holding off foreign journalists and human rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Paapua and western Paapua, so an independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island.
To get here, you have to fly from the province's capital Jayapura for 90 minutes to Nabiresse and then go through a five-hour journey with a rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city, with a population of about 19 000, is made up of tree houses surrounded by bamboo tails and covered by wave iron roofs, whose rust has turned a different tone into yellow brown.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, not to mention journalists, and hardly any foreigners have been here.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the paintings of the honey pago were hailed by a god called uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing such clothes," says Degei, referring to his colourful hand-coated turban, dark plum and private soap.
"Before that, we were wearing only plant leaves on the body."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28 per cent of people living below the poverty line, and statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are one of Asia's worst.
But it is also Indonesia's gold-rich country.
Just 100km from Paniac, a mountainous province of about 153,000 inhabitants in New Jersey, the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based company.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua will be able to boast consumer timber stocks worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are the source of the suffering of boats as they lead to the stifling presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times showed that Freeport paid about $20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to one of the officers.
The efforts of the puppies to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden hangover and are ruthlessly recognisable.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 boats have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killing in the Highlands belonging to Papua tribes in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested by Indonesian police in the region.
The 2016 report by the Archbishop of Birsbane, "We lose everything," contains testimony about atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electric shocks) and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because such incidents occur every week," says Human Rights Watch Indonesia investigator Andreas Harsono.
The screws have been turned off even more strongly, as Papua natural resources have caused an influx of neo-settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's popular Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi islands.
Celebrity family dresses are sold with crisp chicken and mixed vegetables from Gado-Gado, which are served with peanut butter.
The local cannot compete with them.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market from local boats cheaper," explains 24-year-old Abeth You, born in Paniais, who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"Indigenous campaigners like Papua mama-mama [women] are therefore losing their market share."
Indonesian President joko Widodo, who is known among the nation as Jokowi, pledged during his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights abuses in Paapua.
The former puppy won on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace in the Papua 29 constituency of 27, including Paniai.
But in Paapua, very little has changed and the local feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," says You.
In fact, Paniai was struggling at a low point just two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarota were singing along the rocks on Christmas Eve when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle in the darkness.
The horrified children told them they should switch off the front lights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers succumbed to their vocal tone and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the drink soldiers ran behind the children and beat them with their gun handles.
One of the soldiers then shot among the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so brutally that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, a nearby Electoral Commission building was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered to demand justice on a football pitch in front of a local police station and a military command centre.
They were wearing ceremonial hunting boots and presented Papua Mee pago with a sparkling waita-dance, during which Joost walked around and kissed the bird singer.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and militants.
When the anger erupted, the soldiers were sent a command through an internal stadium. "If the crowd points out more than three times the resistance, let them down," according to an official document seen by TIME magazine.
The older Yeremias Kayame, 56, from the town of Kego Koto in the city of Enarotali, felt the threat and called for calm, asking the crowd to go home.
No one had the will to listen.
"Turning around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he told the magazine TIME in his erratic paint on the floor of a tree house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but says the ranks of soldiers gathered in the month.
"There were a lot of people, a lot of cousins," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to a neighbor who witnessed his shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said the magazine TIME grilled Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
'i saw him dead... I kissed him.'
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only ensured the security of his station as it was attacked.
"We must protect ourselves if we are threatened to kill," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for Papua police in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death." "
Five young protesters were killed and many injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
News of the killings arrived in Jakarta just the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapura gave a passionate speech in which he offered his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to address the abuses that took place in Paapua.
"I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve the human rights crimes that have taken place.
But almost immediately, excuses followed.
"Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of these took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes, "he said.
Speaking to TIME on June 5 in Jakarta, however, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying he had no intention of setting up a mechanism in Paapua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, "everything will be resolved by law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of human rights crimes in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor in the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said that 11 human rights crimes had already been resolved in Paapua, including what happened in Paniais.
The families of the Paniai victims took such claims with grim distrust.
"I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired." "
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I will be fired." "
His brother, Yacobus, confirmed the view that the people of Paniai were afraid to ruin the incident.
He said he received a knife from the army after he had helped bury the four victims.
"After burying the dead bodies, the army came to look for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot village residents in Paniai's neighbouring regent in Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, when it went to war between village residents and the head of a construction company who refused to transport the unconscious man to hospital.
This male man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while trying to fish in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Angry village residents protested at a construction site in front of the company's office.
According to police, village residents were throwing stones at police officers, after which the latter responded with warning shots.
But according to local reports, the mobile Brigade (Indonesian military-led police) began shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in great panic, we are afraid of retaliation," said TIME 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured inside.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days." "
Deiyai's parliament has called for the prosecution of police officers involved and the withdrawal of the police mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a problematic place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the honey, moni, dani and damali tribes living in Papua's immersive central mountain countryside.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua movement (VPL) and the army of rebels, which, as they say, protect the rights of boats by carrying out random attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the VPL's leading players are from Paniac, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of 'defending national sovereignty', the army has arrested Paniais over the last few years and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them will never appear again.
Among the Papua people, Pania is known as a "tragic forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarota is too expensive for the local to buy.
The bread is equally unrecognisable.
People grow all their food themselves, mainly bacon, plus a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Branding is the work of women, each of whom can maintain four or five stadium fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, the rest sell on the local market.
Ten bathrooms cost only 10,000 Indonesian rooms (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has deepened between the wealthier boats and the new migrants who have arrived at Nabire Airport since the opening of new airlines.
The few jobs that exist go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
The beneficiaries themselves often lack the capital or the necessary skills to run a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Japan.
In addition, severe restrictions on foreign media remain.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Paapua because "they did not follow relevant practices," although they had been given rare film permission.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy head of Human Rights Watch's Asia department, Jokowi's election promises to lift the restrictions placed on reporters to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"There are new threats to journalists in Indonesia from Papua's most eastern troubled provinces and to reporters in western Paapua, as well as the rejection of visas and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a media drilling watch means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states, Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands, urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "a variety of large-scale crimes" in Paapua, including the shooting of Paniai.
These same countries have historically supported the VPL.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's accusations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "There is still democratic order and freedom of the press in Indonesia, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take notice.
When the Dutch official delegation, headed by the country's human rights ambassador, Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapurat on 4 May, local people interrupted their silence, according to a source who wished to remain anonymous, asking: "We want freedom."
New presidential elections will be held in Indonesia in 2019, but campaigners do not believe they will vote for Jokow again.
"Jokowi is a well-intentioned man, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting," says Hobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants to make it clear to Jokow that not only are the people of Paniai constantly living under the threat of a predatory army, they are struggling in misery because of nightly education and health services.
According to Gobai, Paniai's people, like other campaigners, consider the voice given to his Jokow to be the debt he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims were able to cope with the last symbolic attack, and they buried the dead body of one of the victims in a police station and the military base responded to the land.
Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with a broken head.
"What else could we do?" He said.
Fire nears Dubai Torch pilgrimage for second time in a row
The fire engulfed one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337 metre high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire to have ravaged a high-rise building in just two years, which happens to be called Torchiks, a Texas tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no immediate cause of the fire was reported.
'We were asleep and woke up to the fire alarm and people shouting.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "one resident told Reuters, calling himself George.
According to Dubai civil defense officials, firefighters extinguished the flames at around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cool down the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for those affected.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on high-quality foreign soil around the world.
The investigation, conducted in the wake of the 2015 fire by the Torch Bureau, found that the most damage was suffered by fascination - decorative panels and insulation on the external surface.
British police have said they believe London's Grenfell Tower insulation and fasting panels may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that worked there in June, in which around 80 people died.
Watch: These phones will probably get sales hikes in the autumn
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, as phone makers then unveiled their new top models.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came on sale in the spring, with new hitt-phones expected in the autumn.
According to Tele2 marketing and sales director Kristjan Seema, today's flagships are characterised by an innovative design, an eye-catching scanner, an edge-to-edge 4K resolution screen and an ultra-fast processor.
Great excitement was created in the tech world by the Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the top of the sales ranking of Estonian smartphones.
The autumn will allow smartphone enthusiasts to have even more straighter charging, a more durable battery, a better quality camera and greater water and dust security.
He added that celebrities can already make assumptions and predict the four top models that will probably conquer this year's sales tables.
The four top models of smartphones will still reach stores in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to reach stores as early as mid-September.
Rumours of what the new Apple model looks like and what it can do with it are spreading a lot.
While the iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences to the iPhone 6s, Apple's 10th birthday is expected to erase the new model entirely from the past.
Four colours have been spoken: Black, white, pink gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire phone's front panel, a home button has been lost and a fingerprint reader has been built inside the screen.
Apple design manager JonyIve insists the new iPhone model looks like a smooth glass.
There has also been talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to the eye-catching snooker, steering-free charging and a more high-quality camera, a faster a11 processor can be expected.
It's certainly one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
The premiere of the brand new model Galaxy Note 8 starts on August 23.
The league has plenty of rumours about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
Audible is meant to be even more of a business user, and S Pen allows for even bigger functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wave and the other with a narrower view of the telescope.
At the moment, no one knows what the two tasting cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test, which is certainly comparable to the iPhone 8 in terms of quality.
However, we are very much looking forward to 23 August.
While Nokia has made sales this year with three smartphones at the top of the Nokia 6, there is still a lack of their flagship - Nokia 8, which will be presented as early as 16 August.
Expect a 5.3-inch-wide screen from Nokia, and an ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminium corps and a significant degree of water and dust security in IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two tasting cameras, with optics produced by the firm Zeiss.
While Sony's firm flagship has been at the XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future, with even more innovative features.
We're looking for a smartphone that's a bit more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least as good or better with the camera.
There has been speculation about Sony's new model that its screen is at least bullish.
What reality brings, we can see right now, because traditionally Sony has unveiled its Autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair IFA, which runs from 1 to 6 September this year.
According to a leaked transcript of the phone call, Trump pressed Mexico on paying for the border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders were unveiled by The Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump went on a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto for the latter to stop declaring in public that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president prayed with him for public condemnation of the wall, saying: "You must not say that to the press."
Trump set out his presidential campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts from his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, revealing a tense exchange of views.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that the United States would take on refugees heading to Australia is "ridiculous," "nasty" and "foolish" - he claimed the deal, which was made during the Obama administration.
Trump ended the speech by announcing to Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
In the case where the city of Tartu rejected their tender for the procurement of coach transport between July 2019 and 2029, the Supreme Court did not consider the lines of the OÃœ MRP Linna.
This is a commandment rejecting the offer of the MRP Linna lines in Tartu, as the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Acleantin, Head of the Tartu Urban Government Law Service.
This is the procurement of bus and coach transport within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The MRP Linna lines complained to the Supreme Court about the decision of the Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court did not prosecute it.
While many on social media complain that the noise coming from the Weekend Festival disturbs their night, and the entire city is full of drink celebrities, there are many who have no bad words to say about the festival.
I am even positively surprised that the celebrities in the shops were so courteous!
I did not see any distress or rudeness.
Even the kindness I saw, "says the jealous Laine.
"It is all well and good for the floodgates, the feeling and the joy of PÃ¤rnu, which has been left in the winter like a winter dream," he adds happily.
The daredevil Laine und, who is home from the beach, is not scared.
While living in the city centre, he still heard that music was being played on the beach, now the music has not yet reached his home town.
"But I hope I hear," he says happily.
Agnes, who had a conversation with the Teachers, says that the big festival is rather good for PÃ¤rnu - after all, it contributes greatly to the turnover of local traders.
In addition, he is pleased that so many expats have come to visit the summer capital.
The woman of the celebrity melu does not mix.
Even though I am no longer on the beach, it is nice that the beach has been revived.
And it's great that the nation is moving and that's been the case three times already, "the woman says.
The first time, I think it was a little bit worse.
"Then maybe there were complaints," he tweeted.
But what is happening on the beach, he says, is common for the summer capitals.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little city," says Harri, who is headquartered in the Park.
Melu and MÃ¶ll have not grasped his elbow, either.
But for what?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this interaction between nations would be better.
The man of loud music is not black.
It does not work, even though I live near there.
"Good people can hold together and there is no pause," he speaks.
Guests who come to the wedding are courteous, according to him.
"They are, of course, a little exaggerating with bottles, but young people are young and master God - let us go, but be people and we can do it!" He says.
Coastal residents have travelled anywhere by that time, either to relatives or acquaintances.
"But generally the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this kind of melu," says Tiina, who walks with children in PÃ¤rnu.
His family's dream of festive music didn't bother either, although last year it moved even further from the street.
Last summer the lava was different, then we heard more.
We live outside the city ourselves, that there is actually quite a lot of space along the PÃ¤rnu River, "he says.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to revive business
British education company Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent, thereby launching another restructuring programme to tackle business-threatening distress.
The buy-to-let jobs, which are likely to be laid off by chief executive John Fallon in late 2018 and early 2019, will add to the 4,000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced plans in May to cut costs by another Â£300 million ($394 million) as part of a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business that has been hit by the transition to fast digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann last month, said their expectation for the year had not changed since it reported a 1-per-cent increase in sales.
On Sunday, the rainy season continues with summer warm weather

In many places there is rain, there may be showers.
Lows in the south and west wind from 5 to 11, with outbreaks of up to 14, on the islands and on the coast up to 18 m / s.
The air temperature is between 13 and 17 degrees.
The day comes with an alternating cloud of the weather.
In many places there is rain, there is a chance of snow.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others, according to officials.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
Three civilians were also killed in the incident in the city's Qarabagh cell, according to unconfirmed local reports.
The bombing is the latest in a series of acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Herat mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with "man-made explosives."
All of the injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at a US military hospital at Bagram airport, according to the statement.
According to correspondents, the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (IS), are a serious source of concern for forces in Qarabagh, NATO's Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, nearly 20 percent of them in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shiite raid.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bomb attack in the central city killed more than 150 people - the highest number of deaths caused by a military attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops helping the country's military and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA revoked decision to delay suicidal regulation after hacking
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annulled the decision to delay the introduction of an Obama-era regulation that obliges states to limit emissions caused by sugars, one day after 15 states complained to the agency about the move.
The EPA announced the decision to proceed with the "2015 ozone designation exercise" late Wednesday, saying it shows the agency's commitment to cooperation with states.
"We believe we need to engage in dialogue with our state partners and listen to them," EPA leader Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to delay ozone levels by measuring smoke pollution in different parts of the country to determine where its levels should be reduced by one year to meet the highest air quality standard in 2018.
15 mostly Democratic states filed a lawsuit with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, saying the decision is illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has tried to pull back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama; Trump says it is part of a broader plan to boost economic growth.
But those efforts have sparked mixed reactions among Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the impact of increased pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhalation of air containing ozone "can reduce the ability of the lungs to work and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases," such as asthma.
German pigs can come with a pipe.
German pigs and cattle may come under fire as heavy rains threaten the harvest of the European Union's second-largest wheat producer, writes Bloomberg.
This year, it may be the case that weeks of sausages before harvest may mean that fruit intended for the bread industry can only be fed to animals.
"The quality of wheat is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Agravis Raiffeisen analyst Bernhard Chilla.
This year, up to 40 per cent of German wheat can go into animal feed, which is double compared to normal, forecast Agravis.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First of all, winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by a heatwave in June.
In July, Germany was hit by an avalanche that has continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned to northern Germany, where rain is blocking the harvest.
So far, only five per cent of wheat has been cleared.
Most of the region has not yet started the harvest, reported local harvest collector Ceravis.
"These are pretty difficult days," said Ceravis senior trader Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Consistency in everything, in other words, the clever kicks of Finn's interior design
The beautiful nature plays its part in the interjections of the messy homes because, through the large windows, the magnificent views of Saima's shores end up in many (life) rooms.
At every turn, the attempt by our northern neighbours to create both rough and perfect (energy-saving) homes stands out.
The Finns' ability to use wood as construction and finishing materials, furniture and beauty products deserves admiration and respect.
Virtual techniques and smart solutions can be found in the mesh houses by both the builder and the (home) designer.
It vividly points out that the combination of black, white and grey, if complemented by wood hues and toilet plants, can be very distressing.
Good ideas can be snapped up for another week, as the Fair runs until 13 August.
Accessories and herd pots suggest that there are often coffins in this kitchen.
On the night of the Today show, the line was brought down to this year's Weekend Festival Baltimore, and Martin Garrix gave the title his all to remember as the last speaker.
The nation was in a real turn at the time of Garrix's performance - singing, hugging, dancing in an entertaining way.
When Garrix finished, the common mass of PÃ¤rnu was spread over the city.
We bring you to the gallery with all the pictures that our photographer tried on The Weekend for three days.
Surely you are also in some of them, looking up!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are expected to be on the collision course to face the most attractive boxing match in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN's office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Councilman's lightweight champion, walked to the other end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenko.
After Garcia's unanimous decision resulted in a victory over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner at Showtime on Saturday, both fighters are in the top five of the weight table.
Garcia extended his right hand and said: "How do you go, Champion?
I wish you every success. "
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at Kl 19 on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko's girlfriend Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be "the perfect yardstick."
"I'm a former soccer player," Garcia recalled.
'i moved up for the Broner [63.5kg] but I'm not that big.
I am small at 63.5 kg.
I want to move below the light weight.
And he's got to move an upward lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fans have liked it.
Let's offer them that.'
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight." "
Klimas raised the question of whether watching it should be pay-per-view; it is part of his strategy to let Lomachenko debut in the 62kg class later this year in order to make it possible next summer.
"Watching this fight could be rewarding as fans have liked this confrontation," Garcia said, later saying he was open to fighting on any channel offering the best financial package.
'We're key players.
No other name can get so much attention.
Whenever they're ready... '
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a "mighty champion" and could go to watch his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia, saying he thought the three divisional champions from Riverside were looking "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted this novelist."
Garcia said the goal was to show hitting strength and then boxing.
Both confirmed that they know how the tension between them is growing.
'It's a fight waiting to be realised.
No other confrontation raises so much attention and smells.
I am more than willing to work for it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: 'I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It's going to be a good fight. ""
Which parts of the world will be moved to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Protection Agency (PPA) extended and issued a record number of more than 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia for work, study or family.
When, for example, last year it was decided to issue a fixed-term residence permit to 6702 foreigners, the figure was 4928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis is being prepared by the Ministry of the Interior.
While, ten years ago, nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year, in recent years, this figure is beginning to reach close to 2 000.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased exponentially during the Ukrainian crisis - 1087 people received a fixed-term residence permit in 2014, up from 675 a year earlier.
According to the statistics office, the number of Ukrainian citizens was the highest in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia last year than they left.
"The Ukrainian community has been great in Estonia all the time, and due to difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural for work and learning opportunities to be sought from a country in which the community and many of the family are already ahead," said Interior Ministry spokeswoman Kristin Rammus.
Last year and last year, the number of Ukrainians with fixed-term residence permits was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in 10 years, the largest number of fixed-term residence permits have been issued to the latter.
When Ukrainians come here predominantly to work, Russian citizens are worried about family migration.
"Given the historic Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the largest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, a migration researcher at the Internal Security Academy.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have received Estonian residence permits have moved, there is East Virumaa immediately after Harjumaa," he added, and pointed out that about 40 percent of them are married to European Union citizens.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received a fixed-term residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit decreased.
"The leap is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been requested for permanent residence in Estonia," explained Interior Ministry spokesman Rammus, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonian residence has remained stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years will be able to apply for a new residence permit permanently in Estonia from the previous year.
Its aim is to encourage the transfer of adapted people.
However, a residence permit for a long-term resident requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has apparently been reduced because of the new residence permit.
Last year, for example, this residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians will be able to exchange work, and the Estonian state will no longer point the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit became very popular - the applicants were still holders of grey passports (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 people received a residence permit to settle in Estonia, including, for example, 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
With the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In 10 years, Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, there were 200 last year.
We are coming from Nigeria to study in these universities.
In addition, Estonian higher education institutions are popular, for example, among Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of Indian, Bangladeshi and Nigerian nationals has risen largely thanks to student migration.
For them, too, the rule applies that where a community has arisen, there will be others more easily, "added Rammus.
In 10 years, two people have also moved to Estonia from North Korea, for example, just as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If around 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit per year, that is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if we include the citizens of the European Union, migration will remain around a percentage, "said Maasing, adding that, in fact, the numbers are small.
In total, 14 822 people migrated to Estonia last year, compared to 13 792, according to the statistics office.
This means that immigration surpassed the second year of emigration.
Most of the expats and entrances are Estonian citizens, but more are among those leaving.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was minus 2 000 people in the last year.
Estonians migrate, first and foremost, between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess sizzles with sats, tights and tresses
The bottomless design, however, has a history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours somewhere in the museum and admire old-fashioned thieves and cranes.
If you do something with a knife, you will study and learn more about it every day.
That is the joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem alien to some, but the designer doesn't think so.
You yourself decide how much brilliance is in your life!
I have a friend who has a whole sauna full of kitchens of the haute Couture I created.
Because it is not his fault that he does not live in Hollywood and does not go to the red carpet every day, he also wants to wear these most beautiful knickers, and he is suffering!
You can live your life special!
The fashion artist doesn't recognise the gap between bright events and grey everyday.
It was this reasoning that set in motion a plan to move high fashion in Estonia to rural areas, between forests and fields, to people who are often not reached by fashion.
The Mammu collection was presented, for example, in the VÃµru, JÃµrvis and PÃ¤rnu fashion alley, where the Royal defibrillator of 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, the shop is often taken in, nodded with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere - cry Bravo, stand up, want to thank you at hand.
Much of the audience came to be just as cute, but now they are fans of Mammu Couture.
When you exceed people's expectations, they are spirited!
And I like the feeling that I'm in my fashion business as if on a summer tour.
In PÃ¤rnu, we had a 50-metre red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful kittens, it looked like they weren't coming to an end!
Maria also does not recognise the fashion practice that the creation must be presented to the Superman supermodell; she willingly brings ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own customers to the stage - they are always happy to come.
It is, after all, such a bet experience, you can shine on the stage in a wonderful place!
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen my performances, I am always behind the lava to give the last glimpse of things as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerves would not allow me to sit calmly on the floor.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who wants not only to play a representative role, but to be involved in everything.
I have a studio in my boxing machine, most of the collections I carry out myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, you discover.
I am never far from my creativity, and I am not afraid of the work.
Design is not the end of the story, but also the style, logistics, organisation, organisation - everything has to fit into one temperamental woman's day.
These working hours will still be enormous for the fanatics.
I can't tell when my working day will end, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an incessant chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and, in turn, compliments.
It has been said several times that there is magic in my kitchens - they make you feel like a princess.
The abundant treacherous satire that made Maria famous overnight has left the Mammu Couture signalling to this day.
Martin MÃ¼rsepp of the U18 boys: The weapon of the Estonian alagrupiturnir was now turned against us
Sorry, the fairy tale ran out.
The first thing that stood out was that we couldn't get our laugh.
And if there is such a big difference in the table, there is nothing to do, "commented the Estonian U18 basketball boys 61: 75.
Opponents took 28 balls from the attacking table and got so many more attacks because of it.
We were also not prepared for their aggressive defence or attack, it created.
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build protection.
In defence, however, they were able to keep their hands everywhere; we could not combine.
It created the team's feet from the bottom.
The homework of the opponents was better done.
MÃ¼rsepa estimated that Estonia had to make more tactical mistakes in order to take down the momentum of its opponents.
In the last quarter - we had zero errors, but opponents already got several quick baskets.
Athleticism and a tight offensive line, which was our weapon in the sub-group tournament, now all turned against us.
Today we had no strength against their aggressiveness.
The mystery star remained in peace with her nephew in Kalevis, Matthias Tass.
On the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team; to this day there was a single rugby player.
It is a pity that such an aggressive response had not been met before.
Tass has been confident all the time and played his way out today, but it looked like he was tired - he has borne quite a burden.
But he made some quite nice moves that I have seen in the trenches before, "added the supervisor.
Horrifying numbers: The swans' basketball team threw an EM tournament with three strikeouts with less than 10 points....
The U18 age class does not just go to the young men's emi B-divison basketball tournament in Tallinn, the kidneys started the day before yesterday in Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland, unfortunately, rocked the field of antirecords.
Estonia lost 25: 65, but after the third quarter the score was 9: 49. It was only in the last ten minutes that the opponents took a foot from the gas pedal, and that period remained at 16: 16.
In both the first and second quarter, Estonia scored 4, the third 1 points....
In doing so, the Estonians initially hit two of the first four whistles in two minutes, then went on to play 25 pieces, then one bogey inside and then another 21 throw away...
Perhaps in almost half an hour, 47 whales were caught in one.
In addition, 2 points came from four free throws.
The balloting was a reasonable number at that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland's throw hits were 33 and Estonia had 13 percent (68 / 9).
Estonia had started with two losses, the opening day had to admit Portugal's 83: 56 runners-up.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to supplement supplies
Today, NATO's 1st permanent mine group arrived in Tallinn over the weekend for a planned port visit to supplement ship supplies and prepare for pre-existing exercises.
During the visit, the ships prepare to return to the sea and, at the same time, give the crew the opportunity for a couple of days of holidays.
Following the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a series of exercises and be prepared for future operations to search for historic explosives.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the co-operation activities carried out by them in local waters illustrates well our integration with the allied forces," said the chief of the operations and planning department of the naval fleet.
As of 29 June, NATO will lead the 1st permanent anti-mine group, the Latvian navy captain Gvido Laudups, who took over the group's tasks from the Estonian naval officer at a ceremony in Riga.
The flag carrier of the group is the Latvian naval support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, which also operates the group's steering board.
In this half of the year, the Estonian navy mine hunter Sakala is also part of the international unit.
As one of the four groups of vessels under NATO naval command, NATO's 1st permanent anti-mine group is a readiness unit belonging to the primary emergency responders, whom the alliance can send to various locations around the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become the site of the Birgitta Festival, which was launched 13 years ago by Maestro Eri kans.
This year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to the artistic leader of Tallinn Filharmonic, Risto Joosti (36).
Risto Joost: Listeners to the opera world's classics include "Traviata" and "Tosca," balletic answers from the fascinating "Bolerost" podcast.
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre answers.
It's bigger than any musical theatre in its usual form.
This is a festival whose slums take hold and never quite open again.
For the experience that the listener receives in this surreal and mysterious environment makes the human souls brighter, and touches on human perception in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic leader of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Did Maestro Eri's kid shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klass, it has been a lot of help.
He directed me through the whole of my student career and also supported a dirigising career at the beginning.
Perhaps it is thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue his work.
Different klas have injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it's all passed on to me as well.
It was great to join a team that knows how things are going exactly.
It was the great heart of Eri's kids that gave me the strength to thrive in Tallinn Filharmonia with the Birgitta Festival.
And here I am now and I get it!
What could erase audiences at this year's festival, what special are you offering?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, as a surprise, the presentation is, by the way, the first ballet written on the story of Astrid Lindgren.
It's like, "Karlsson fly."
And one notorious nuance about this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write this book.
He has probably been living in the Karlsson shrine since he was a child.
Risto, how do you cook it all?
Thanks to my supportive life partner, certainly.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I am fortunate to have it.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend as much on other people as I do, that is, how I go to every new day.
And that kind of conscious tone, keeping positive, and actually smiling at yourself in the morning mirror, greatly increased my happiness.
Especially now this week, when there are the most important tests, I have practiced it particularly aggressively and it works.
Giving yourself a smile activates the brain and raises the tone.
This is not just a buzzword.
I think that people do not yet know the things of their body that the universe offers them, but it is slowly being discovered by each and every one of them.
Right now, this is an important moment.
Do you have some sort of ritual before the wedding of the dirigendi?
It is still, the clothes must be exchanged for the more comfortable.
This is this little moment for yourself.
But, in general, yes, I do not have the opportunity to rest before a great appearance or to make a small cuddle.
In fact, I even like to actively communicate with people, even before taking a dirigentine pulse.
But come to the Birgitta Festival, here's what to discover for a not-so-great opera and ballet friend!
Watch the hilarious video with Risto Joost!
New results of tests for assessing the age of Swedish asylum applicants published
The latest results of the test show that more than 80% of teens were assessed as older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of forensic medicine (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) started the tests earlier this year.
The tests were set up to accurately assess age during the asylum application process after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly underage refugees.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases for testing, and the Institute of forensic medicine has issued a total of 2481 test results between mid-March 2017 and July 31.
Eighty per cent (2002) were assessed as 18 years old or older, and in another 25 cases, the Institute of forensic medicine estimated that the test "could be 18 years old or older."
In 432 cases, it concluded that the man is "probably younger than 18."
Tests are only used when a person's age is questioned.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson, who works at the Institute of forensic medicine, the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told the newspaper The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum applicants have lied about their age.
The institute issued 581 test results in May and said that in 442 cases "there are indications that the person under investigation is 18 years old or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of these 581 tests, it emerged that in 243 cases a person had directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, which makes smart X-ray images and anti-inflammatory MRT, after which they are allowed to be analysed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the sceptics is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose tasks include assessing people's biological maturity to find out whether they went through puberty sooner or later.
'i have had reason to think about it and I don't think the method of measurement currently used should be used.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we should not make a face that we can, "he told the newspaper Metro.
But Johan GÃ¶ransson from the Institute of Judicial Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that there is a low risk of a child being sexually assaulted.
The largest, or about 10 percent, is at risk if a person is a little under 18. "

The 20-year-old left-hander Anna Maria Orel made a fine debut at the London Mall, getting a good 18th place with 67.37s.
Orel was MM's youngest female wrestler, and the cheerful woman confirmed she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The contest went well and I got a good experience.
In the first Test (64.80) I immediately made my average score, in the second (62.80) I risked too much and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear, "Orel said after the match.
I was looking for my emissions and I'm so glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orelli's MM debut ended with a good 18th place.
Rain Orelit did not mix because, after all, he traveled through winter at the TCIS stadium.
"I'm scared," he said with a small mug.
At the London Olympic Stadium there was almost a full-house section of the nation, did Orel kill people around him or was he able to turn himself off?
I said, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it gives more - that is it!
If you've won, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed he remains satisfied with MM's debut and there are still plenty of good matches ahead of him: "I came here this season with the 32nd or final result, I finished 18th.
This is a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and MMS - that's the only thing that matters.
I take a good experience and some days I want to compete for medals already.
West Virgina governor announced party change
West Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced at a rally Thursday evening with President Trump that he would replace the party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats were walking away from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I say to you, having prayed and thought a lot... today I say to you, the Western Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
There were joys of joy at the gathering.
"So I will become a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a trainer, I would say to you," It's time to play another game. ""
Trump had promised a major announcement earlier at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not support Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the state's only billionaire, was elected in 2016, according to Forbes.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and the coal business pretty much him from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued an announcement Thursday evening that "Governor Justice's party exchange is another blow to a democratic party that would rather prevent the country from getting better again than working for it."
"With just 15 governor seats and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent wake-up call for a party that has come to an end and is unable to find a positive.
It is no surprise that, where there are many people, there are also many injured.
Urmet, who served in the Weekend medical examiner's office, told The Associated Press yesterday that they have had to share quite a lot of the plasters.
Villagers and marries are basic, apart from miscarriages and light falls.
Head, back and foot, of course.
According to Urmeti, visitors come to the festival with the wrong footwear, and so the problems come.
Medics have also had to assist visitors with a few more injuries - there have been some panic attacks as well as one foot broken.
We have also made rumors when a man has broken his hand or finger.

Coe praised Russians' honest apology over doping scandal
Athletics international nominee Sebastian Coe praised "Russia's Thursday honest apology" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country back into the sport.
Russian Legislature nominee Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World athletics Championships that the match ban imposed on his country is the right one and he has a firm goal of fighting doping.
He asked for an apology "from all athletics fans who have been stripped of gold and silver medals in the competition."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the contest ban, which was introduced in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think today was a very honest response, a very honest presentation," IAAF president Coe told journalists.
"The entire council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian alumni admitted to themselves that they have had quite difficult times and that they are doing everything possible to restructure the alliance."
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its own enrollment.
"I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the group's proposal that now is not the time to withdraw Russia," Coe said.
'We need to do everything possible over the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always approached the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from a broken system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletics fans who meet the IAAF's strict criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the World athletics Championships in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF working group, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of criteria for retaliation.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that doping control was still inadequate and that the trainers who received the ban were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution will dramatically change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only will the electric car revolution dramatically change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say that from one place they will win and lose on the other, smaller mining firms will not help.
Glencore is currently serving coal and oil, but in the age of electric cars, cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel demand will continue to grow.
This year, contributions to the spread of electric cars have been raised by the decisions of the governments of the UK, France and Norway, which promise to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
The setup has already informed Volvo that they plan to scrap the internal combustion engine, and Tesla will bring a cheaper Model 3 electric car to the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that electric cars will be sold more than oil-powered cars over the next two decades.
"For some metals, it changes everything," Capital Economics commodities analyst Simona Gambranini told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has been increasing for years.
Electric cars have about three times more copper than conventional cars, reported Glencore.
Even more copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribasi estimates it will increase copper demand by about five per cent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric batteries means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glencore will benefit from a growing electric car trend from copper price rises and from being the world's largest cobalt producer, forecast Jefferies Group.
Its broker company estimates that the other electric car race winners are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is reacting to an already changing trend.
This year, the London Metal Exchange has scored 70 per cent.
Buoyant prices were up 37 per cent.
Copper has also climbed 14 per cent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore shares rose 20 per cent in London, having surged in price to rival Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the losers' side are lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine, which will have to adjust to a new era.
The main end-use of the lead is the batteries supplying the starters of cars with petrol and diesel engines.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk for lead demand unless another purpose is found to overcome the fall in demand," said Michael Widmer, head of metal market analysis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The impact of the downward trend has not yet been observed in the form of the lead price movement.
Lead has rocketed 17 per cent this year, with it being the best metal among the main industrial metals in London.
Investors see problems with the metal only far away in the future.
"I'm not sure the lead is so bad because cheap oil keeps conventional cars in competition," said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager of metal broker Triple Metals.
When lead demand falls, it happens slowly.
Perhaps that will be the case in about 10 years' time.
In the meantime, stricter emissions standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which depend on advanced lead-based batteries for frequent engines, will be assessed by the international lead and cycling research organisation.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel as a lighter car can drive further with less electricity.
This can be explained by an additional 1.6 million tonnes of lower minimum demand from 2013 to 2016.
It accounts for 2.7 per cent of the world's total aluminum production.
This trend is likely to get worse, "Widmer said.
Aluminium has climbed 13 per cent this year as rising demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers do not sleep.
Ak Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce tiny automobiles.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter smelter of steel to withstand the lower minimum.
"Super-strong steel should be the answer to this development," said Exane BNP Paribasi analyst Sylvain Brunet.
We see some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil era can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal diesel engine was used as a catalyst for cars, reported metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"For many now with high demand for raw materials such as oil and platinum, there may not be much demand in the future," said Natixis commodities analyst Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, head of Uncore, said more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025.
The big hope for platinum producers in the 10-year term is Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motosi developed hydrogen-based cars that rely on platinum to produce electricity from hydrogen.
So far, however, this technology has not yet commercially justified itself.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars," Exane told BNP Paribist Brunet.
German carmakers suffered a major setback in July as a Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in the city of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
Rules designed to prevent the unbridled spending of European football clubs will not prevent Neymar's world-record switch from Spanish football club Barcelona to French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that dominates the European game and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, are still ahead of Paris Saint-Germain.
The financial rules for fair play introduced by UEFA in 2011 (FFP) mean PSG must mildly prove that Neymar's switch was funded without a huge loss.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros ($262 million) alone to buy the Brazilians out of his contract, and Neymar's salary is set to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's French club transfer.
PSG will no doubt be able to hand out such money to recruit Neymar and include his stars in the squad, given that the team is funded by a family dominated by Qatar's energy squad.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come up with those in the football business.
The FFP laid the groundwork for Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs who fall into big debt in search of success would actually deal with fraud and risk ruin if banks or owners were to give up support.
Since 2011, the FFP is focusing on tracking their losses instead of the club's debts.
That change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and then make big spending to improve the team and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
During the FFP's current three-year assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs could face losses of up to â‚¬30 million.
And despite Platini being reportedly ousted from the presidential office in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, remains committed to obstructing excessive spending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules," said Andrea Traverso, an FFP supervisor at UEFA, last week.
Although PSG paid for Neymar's overpurchase clause as a single full payment, they will be able to split that amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, making it possible to show a transfer fee of â‚¬44.4 million over the next five years.
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, received the worst penalties.
PSG were fined 60 million euros ($82 million at that point), later reduced to 20 million euros, and the club were ordered to restrict the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-15 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs who may try to cleverly hand over regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their incomes through the club's owners' businesses.
The Qatari company may be sponsoring PSG, but if the value of sponsorship is deemed to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to count on official earnings.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority's PSG support was inflated.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymar's PSG service could come from Qatar via payments from the 2022 World Cup management committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become an ambassador for the World Cup, and argue that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean UEFA will be even more vigilant in relation to any attempts to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not proactively discussed Neymar's transition with PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed as they are not allowed to discuss the situation with PSG.
The latest reports show that PSG earned more than 10 million euros in profit during the 2015-2016 season with a turnover of around 542.4 million euros.
Data for the last financial year has not yet been released.
PSG are hoping Neymar's arrival will have a positive impact on sponsorship deals, merchandise and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase of at least 30 per cent in turnover in connection with the signing of the contract.
Spain too, clearly annoyed by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to block Neymar's move, claiming PSG would breach the FFP with it.
"This is a clear case of financial doping with the club and the country," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to PSG primarily owned by Qatar.
Arsenal striker Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's stance that the country is funding the club.
"This is a consequence of property rights and it has completely changed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
'If the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a great player in the country. "
Norway's low-cost airline, Norwegian, has a nice tradition of putting on the airwaves the images of those who have shifted boundaries in their own field and have been an inspiration to others, writes trip.ee
With the expansion of Norwegian's operating geography, the circle of people who earned a seat on the plane has also expanded.
Among the selected perks are Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (pictured) and Miguel de Cervantes.
In the near future, however, one plane will feature a portrait of the Queen's legendary singer Freddie Mercury.
Today 50 years ago: A hurricane-ravaged storm in Estonia that ripped roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane referred to as the storm of the century, which raged on 6 and 7 August, caused major damage, in particular, to the West Bank, Harjumaa and Rapland.
In north-west Estonia, wind speeds of more than 30 m / s were high during those days.
My old man ran into the garden from one caving tree to another and broke with his hands to support them.
Everything was dark and ragged, like a world cup.
The tale was already flying from houses to roofs, recalled in 2002 by grandmother Linda Kurova Haapsalu in an interview given by Estonian Nature.
Linda's husband saw how the self-planted garden collapsed.
But what do you still support with your hands, where do you get against such a storm?
The sea came under the window, the window was primed into the water, "Ms Linda, who lived on the street in Haapsalu, told reporters at the time.
That the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station had flown to a distance of 20 to 30 metres, Linda saw most of the Haapsalans in a similar way until the next morning.
According to the local, the trees behind Paralepa were on the ground, some completely lonely, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went from beautiful old trees to ragina and praggy through like a war.
West Virumaa was not hit particularly hard by the August 1967 storm compared to western Estonia, but the losses were great there, the Virumaa Journal wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu LossiPark and Padise Park were swept from the ground, but our kandi parks were also heavily damaged.
In Tallinn, the wind was measured at speeds of up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometres per hour.
At Merifield in Tallinn, on the evening of 6 August, one of the little penguins shouted: "Mother, mother!
The chickens are in the air and no longer get down!, "the Virumaa Journal wrote.
The manor building in Viljandimaa was destroyed during the storm to such an extent that it was decided to be demolished later.
The August storm did not withstand the constructions of the TÃ¼ri ski mountain, which was later no longer restored.
The newspaper Red TÃ¤ht wrote on 12 August 1967 that the harvesting of towns and settlements from abandoned trees and their branches was progressing slowly, and residents could get involved in cleaning work.
Grain fields were also severely affected by the storm, and the newspaper reported that "party primary organisations must be encouraged and guided by both maintenance work and grain harvesting."
Hurricanes can be told if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m / s.
The record of Puerto Rican wind in Estonia persists from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul measured wind speeds of 48 m / s.
A meter broke out on the island of Vaindloo, so the speed of the strong winds measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean bathing areas: Night cleaning work and poor coastal weather
The coldest summer weather also means less cleaning effort in Tallinn bathing areas.
"If there is no, then there are people on the beach, and if there are not, then there are no people," says the beach cleaning agent.
Evacuees scrambled on the beach of the Stroom in northern Tallinn.
They are offered a melodic competition on the low turn by a rainbow tractor that ploughs down the driveway.
In fact, the last of the seven centimetres is screening through the sand, picking up the marine litter and the cross left behind by the people: Puddles, cigarette cones and so on.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If there is beautiful weather, then people are on the beach, and if not, there are no people, "says Aleksandr Usov, head of cleaning works at the Haabersti Haldus beach.
It is 6.30 p.m. and there is bitter cleaning work on the beach, because at 8 o'clock, the plate must be in order for the people.
Usov is on the job post as early as 4 p.m.
Apart from Stroom, he keeps an eye on the beaches of Pirita, Lake Harku, KakumÃ¤e and Paljasaare Pikakari.
The amount of rubbish has decreased.
Years ago, it was much more.
People can now already appreciate what is being done for them, "says Usov, who has been cleaning the beach for 15 years.
Before, it was the case that when something new was put up, it was already broken the next day.
Now we are already keeping what is on the beach.
The price of a clean beach
One of the biggest works on Estonian beaches is the harvesting of sea debris, or adru, which has been washed ashore.
For example, on the coast of Pirita, 400 000 tonnes will have to be taken away from this coastal season.
"It's an incredible amount," notes Usov.
The second major category is municipal waste, which is all that people leave behind.
The half-kilometre Stroom beach has eight large bin containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
There is so much rubbish.
However, the coldest summer weather has meant that the rubbish is a fifth less than otherwise.
The third species is made up of abandoned things.
For the most part, these are children's lives.
This time, Usov has climbed out of the sand with a dozen mudelatos.
They left the owners waiting on a wooden road leading to the beach.
"They usually come out more, but this is a normal harvest." Usov already knows that he will soon find them in the sand again.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
Rubbish is torn apart
Haaberstown Administrative Services spokeswoman Erika Scholler admits that the tractor's screening work is disrupting local ones.
The noise, which runs from the early hours to the early morning, disrupted the sleep of people living in the neighbourhood.
On the day, however, this work is impossible.
In one month, the rand must be screened twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," Scholler notes.
But the goal, like Pirita, Pikakari and PÃ¤rnu, is also to get the Stroom Rand under the hallmark of the international Siniflag.
"Compared to Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are maintained," says Scholler.
We have more adrenaline and stones, and it's harder to screen the sand.
However, there is less rubbish on our beaches than in the rest of Europe.
Upon hearing that there is talk of rubbish on the beach, Martin, who lives near the beach of Stroom, unexpectedly enters the conversation between the journalist and the cleaning staff, highlighting the current bottlenecks of the beach.
In the morning, there is a balcony picture everywhere.
The problem is with birds and puppies who have been pulled out of rubbish bags, "reports Martin.
While it is hard to assume that people will be able to change their current behaviour, Martin hopes that the city government will take action with the bin and, for example, put them on the canvas to prevent at least birds from making news there.
Overall, though, Martin is happy with the development of the Stroom beach.
You can see the city taking care of it.
With children's squares, enlightened and newly asphalt roads, it has become more enjoyable.
It was once the case that the balloons only got one way to drive, "notes Martin.
AardekÃ¼t findings in Stroom: Coins, only coins
A 40-year-old Dimitri, who reportedly stumbled on a metal detector's coat, has come to take advantage of the morning snowfall.
He does not believe that anything precious will be found today or in the future.
Marine gods are not generous enough to do so.
"I have been dealing with this for a year and have not found anything valuable so far," reports Dmitry.
As a hobby hunter, Dmitry's treasure house has some coins, puddles, as well as dangerous nails that are later thrown in the bin.
Usually there are still coins.
"Gold, fingers and other skirts are usually not," says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at former levels as weak economic growth and inflation easing have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that growth will remain sluggish as households' squeezed incomes have put interest rates on hold.
Policymakers at the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep the 6: 2 rate at 0.25 per cent, and fewer members are calling for a rise this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7 per cent and 2018 to its 1.6 per cent, and warned that pressure on household incomes will persist as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank also signalled that the rise in rates will be necessary to curb inflation due to Brexit over the next few years, and a higher-than-expected rise in borrowing costs may be required in financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of a partial withdrawal of the mammoth package that was launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
The bank will end a fixed-term funding scheme in February that offers cheap funding to banks, although it said it now expects a Â£15 billion higher offer under the scheme, worth Â£115 billion.
In minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future as the difficult situation of real household incomes continues to have an impact on consumption."
On rates, it was reiterated that a "slight tightening of monetary policy" was needed to mitigate inflation, and to a "somewhat larger" extent than expected in the markets.
The stock is currently predicting a first rise in the third quarter of next year and a second rise in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any jump is gradual and limited.
The bank's reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to May's forecasts of 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The forecast for 2018's 1.8-percent growth remained.
After that news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 percent to $1.31 and 0.4 percent to $1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened growing hopes of a rise, with GDP rising 0.2 per cent in the second quarter to 0.3 per cent in the previous three months.
The bank says growth is likely to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will start to gain some momentum at the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little cause for joy to households suffering from rising inflation and miserable wage increases, saying the situation would get a little worse before improving.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent a hit on incomes over the next few years, but a marked return in wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Because of the weak pound, the economy is also being stimulated by growing demand for British produce, which is partly offset by lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates moved to 0.25 per cent last August after a shocking EU referendum caused a sudden weakening of the pound.
The bank estimates it is likely to take four years to fully breathe life into prices and the economy.
Before the bank's latest decision, there was a growing demand to raise rates as inflation had increased pressure on hard-pressed households; in July, three policymakers called for a rate increase of 0.5 per cent.
Inflation fell to 2.6 per cent last month, compared with 2.9 per cent in June, although the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said excessive growth compared to the 2 per cent target was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco mortgage brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in exchange rates, the mortgage market appears to be becoming increasingly competitive again as lenders scramble to work and hope to end the year positively.
The exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current deals are coming to an end, as refinancing, often without a service fee and at a low rate, has become "increasingly popular."
NHS is writing a controversial HIV drug for 10,000 people
Patients will have access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment since September after a battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England reported that the National Health Service is now making an estimated 10,000 people available for pre-exposure prophylactic (Prep) treatment during the initial three-year clinical trial - a tablet that was administered before the incident and has shown a high risk of infection by around 86 per cent.
The NHS agreed to fund a clinical trial after an appeals court upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS was able to pay for Prep, despite the authority's own claims that the drug should be funded by local authorities instead.
NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens welcomed the move unveiled on Thursday as a "new massive intervention," while the National AIDS Foundation (NAT) described it as a "pivotal moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start registering people.
Pre-exposure prophylactic (Prep) is a molecule of HIV drugs that are taken before mid-term to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that Prep significantly reduces HIV transmission among people with the risk of infection.
Taking Prep before the break means there is a sufficient amount of certain drugs in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the break.
Suitable candidates for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment.
Clinics identify suitable people willing to participate in clinical coverage, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-affected partner does not receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their wish to participate in a local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The programme costs Â£10 million and NHS England signed a contract to receive the drugs this week following an international procurement procedure.
The clinical trial aims to assess the true potential of Prep by gathering clinical evidence about who the drug is for and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new large-scale intervention should complement and amplify the wide-ranging and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of fighting one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity. "
Deborah Gold, chief executive of NAT, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
Prep, if targeted correctly for those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to change England's HIV epidemic.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England, through this clinical test funded by the NHS, have access to a powerful new tool that is individually administered and does not depend on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The priority now is to ensure that a clinical trial across the country is swiftly launched and that no HIV risk group is excluded.
Now that the medication for Prep's clinical trial has been obtained, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV.
Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of a clinical trial at Prep is very welcome and greatly delayed after months of delays and the looming of the government's feet.
The evidence shows the major changes this drug can bring to HIV prevention work and to stopping the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical test takes us a step closer to a full understanding of Prep's benefits.
It is now important for the clinical trial to be introduced across the country as soon as possible to protect people with exposure to HIV and to take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society. "
The price of electricity rose by 12% in Estonia and fell in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference in the stock price for the next day of electricity between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to EUR 1.94, compared to EUR 7.71 in June this year, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price difference is the riches of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia, the average stock price for electricity was EUR 34.33 per megawatt-hour last month, and the price increased by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per megawatt hour.
In Finland the price was EUR 34.17, while the electricity exchange Nord Pool system price was EUR 26.37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices rose 12 and seven per cent respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved 75% of the hours of last month towards Estonia and 16% of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of hours between the two countries did not take place the following day.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Latvia 99% of the time from Estonia to Latvia, and in 73% of the hours the entire transmission capacity was in operation.
According to transactions on the last trading day of July on the NASDAQ OMX market, the stock price for electricity in August could be around 34 and September 37 per megawatt-hour.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affects the production price of electricity, rose last month and the transactions took place at a price of EUR 5.04 to EUR 5.47 per tonne.
Living a high life - a half-floor and smart design has turned it into a small Earls Court apartment space home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator, switched her large Knightsbridge home to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold the flats is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with a former life partner in Knightsbridge on a much bigger ground," said Joanne.
'i was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and had similar high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day.'
Since the first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a complete upgrade.
At first it was a flat with one bedroom and a complex layout - to reach the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and half-floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
'i wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
Those were my demands, "he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, an architecture and design studio in Duck & Sets, to take advantage of the 3.8 m high-rise warehouses and create a home that would not just be a development site, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
"The metal design is quite complex," he explains.
'We had to rearrange the rooms so they were located on each other without having to bow.
It was not just about building a platform, but we used a steel design so that the height of both the upper and lower space would be right. "
This placement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms on top of each other in the room, with plenty of dramatic elements.
From the poolside, an old-fashioned copper light opens up to the glamorous living space under the window of Retrouvius.
Golden furniture, silver detail and retrospective Serge Mouille's lighting highlight the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, space and light saturation.
At both ends of the short corridor, mirrors have been added to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the back of the mirror gives the impression of another tuppy opening window.
At the entrance, the mirror offers a storage place for all of Joanne's meals and glass requirements.
The living room adds a charm opportunity to close the kitchen if it is not used, creating an image of a glamorous space.
Matching kitchens are nothing new.
In this kitchen, however, there is a unique fact that this is a garage-type revolving door.
"There was a bit of design effort going into it," explains Erfan with a steel-strength spooked MDF from the door.
'It has a counterweight, which is why it smells very easily when it's out.'
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra square feet, an extra bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"At the end of the day, the underground pint is what you sell - or what gives the property value," says Erfan.
"The real estate broker enters an outdated form of tuppa and makes calculations based on the underground surface."
Here, they've been able to increase the floor space, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the space.
"Materials are the ones you touch and thereby help create an emotional bond with the home," says Erfan.
'You don't fall in love with the electrical cable in the wall.
This is important, but it does not make the heart's languages brighter. "
It shows that good design and increased surface area help make something amazing from a pretty normal flat.
In fact, they may even cause a desire not to leave, as was the case with Joanne.
Actor Dane Jensen is a celebrity hunter working in the Chicago pilgrimage, competing with a colleague for a professional high school.
It does not matter other than the amount of money that is earned, alongside which any ethics will be forgotten.
His wife and three children are seen by the man just early in the morning and late at night.
In the first half of the film, I find myself thinking that this is, after all, a version of the business world of "The House of Cards" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler are similar.
The more the film goes on, the less of a cathedral element remains, and the moralising intention of the filmmakers is increasingly beginning to stand out.
As a life-changing experience, the main character gets a son's illness from cancer.
A choice must now be made between work and family life.
The unrecognisable son of an architect makes his father walk to Chicago's great buildings to think about really important things like faith, goodness, love... without touching even the disaster of the twin towers.
After the third scene in which the son's father opens his eyes, there is a feeling that the filmmakers have approached the goal of getting the audience to cry, because even the most healthful viewer cannot hold back tears.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally understands the morality of his work and makes a good deed to an old man seeking work.
Now, in a sense, I bet with myself - if the film has a happy feel, I reward my weirdness after the film's clue, if I'm wrong, the stylist can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there is a suspicion that you will be left without a coffee - when the husband calls Dane to the hospital and the man stretches in slow motion towards the naked side of the corridor.
The son is, however, miraculously entertained, and although his father has just lost his job, this will prove positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can predict the end of the American drama pretty well!
In fact, the film is well designed, all the necessary elements are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and mortar beautiful: Money is not the most important thing in life.
The soap brings this film well.
Mr. Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will really get on with it, too.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the White House's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information reaching President Trump, including news, in the hope that it will keep the crowd in more balanced water.
Here's a cover from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the White House's new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with high-level officials on his first day in office, he pointed out a key problem for President Donald Trump in the White House, which he plans to address.
Kelly told officials that the information "must go through him, whether on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was shared with good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems entirely logical, but others have tried it too, and they have failed to tame Trump by tracking his media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he is in the White House, his TV viewing habits have gone nowhere.
"When candidate Trump was angry about unfair media coverage, it was hard to show him that he was being reflected in compelling publications in an honest way," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "the key to managing Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praises."
Very well.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter usage habits have ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know that Trump's shutdowns would have been even more heartening without their interventions.
We'll probably never know about the shutdowns that Trump did not post.
When his helpers managed to save him either or a couple of times from the pitch, their ponds were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from consistently creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House of competing clicks, people are invariably trying to advance their own interests by transmitting material to Trump that supports their world views but may not always be credible.
Politico, reflecting on the course of the story, wrote in May about advisers' tendency to feed the president with strategically questionable information.
One of the examples, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher, reads:
"Current and former Trump subordinates say that Trump can respond to negative press, especially damaging impact leaflets, explosive," according to an obsession with identifying their source.
This was also the case in late February, when someone reportedly gave the president a printed copy of an article on the internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson's website GotNews.com, which accused the chief of staff, Katie Walsh, of being the source of "a number of leaks from the White House."
It doesn't matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of the hacking, or that he did not offer any specific evidence or that he has also made false accusations in the past and withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and began asking the subordinates about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Chief of Staff Rob Porter "have tried to establish a system to manage and document documents reaching Trump."
How did it succeed?
Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader of Priebus, but Trump remains impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These changing factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians who have come to the capital from abroad will not be allowed to speak.
In the centre of Tallinn, there are a lot of foreigners in the dressing room.
Those with whom the fire came to light acknowledged that they were playing in the old town without the permission of the city administration.
First we found three street musicians near the gates of Viru, who had taken the same number of dogs with them.
It was clear to see that musicians with rhinoceros and sculpted clothes were selfie-goers who would spend one shower marching away.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the group played a fun rhythm in the accordion, while one man stood next to him in a three-ball juggernaut and invited the bystanders closer.
A third man sat next to them on one of the backs and smoked a ready-made plunge in the heart.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing nation.
Bob, who played the accordion with Noemi and pals, was told to muster the streets for both fun and money.
The aim of the company was to collect tickets for a ship travelling to Finland on the same day.
On the question of whether they asked for permission from the city for filming in the old town, Noemi and Bob were shaking their heads.
Firstly, we did not know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple, and mostly permits are granted for a month or something like that.
It makes no sense to pay for it, "explained Bob.
When we got back to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw two women play with musicians and drive them away.
The company moved on to the cross-section of the Viru Centre with bags and dogs.
On the street of Viru, there were also three Polish young men, one of whom played a fiddle, the other a clarkson, and the third had even brought an electronic piano.
"We are here to provide entertainment for people to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living," explained trio pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that there must be permission from the city government to speak.
"Of course we don't have it," he joked.
But we hope that when people enjoy our music, there's no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we go elsewhere, but we have to try, "he added.
The Bank of Estonia bought bonds for EUR 149 million in July as part of the public asset purchase programme of the central banks of the euro area, while the central bank's bond portfolio grew to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank does not publish more detailed information about the purchases.
The President of the Estonian bank, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained in response to questions from members of the national assembly that the asset purchase scheme of the central banks of the Eurosystem includes three different purchase programmes: Bonds covered by the financial sector (covered Bonds), property-secured bonds (ABS) and public bonds (PSPP).
The central bank is buying bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Purchases have an impact on the return of lower-risk assets, and this motivates investors to take greater risks.
As a rule, under the public bond purchase programme, each central bank buys its own government bonds; the bonds of other countries are not purchased.
As the Estonian state has not issued bonds, the Bank of Estonia makes so-called replacement purchases within the limits of the amount allocated to them.
Purchases are also made by central banks in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited.
The Bank of Estonia generally buys the bonds of the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Investment Bank (EIB), according to Hansson.
The Bank of Estonia has been buying bonds under the asset purchase programme since March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering bonds were acquired, but in June 2016 the Bank of Estonia will no longer buy Elering bonds.
On behalf of the central banks of the euro area, the central bank of Finland buys both Elering and Estonian Energy bonds as of June.
Travellers ignore ditches and return to 'millionaires' rails
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands have once again been caught up in a fierce confrontation with determined travellers who have ignored the council's digging ditch to win back a field away from their villains.
Travellers have parked their 20 gigantic villas on the outskirts of the wealthy "millionaires" near the crispy Solihull street.
They have returned, along with the army of horses, children and trucks, after they were only struck out there in May, without letting themselves be distracted by a ditch that was digested by the council to prevent their invasion.
The activist group found a weak spot in the defences, squeezing their vehicles through an unblocked section that had been left on foot.
Furious residents have slammed Solihull council, saying the council is "useless in dealing with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday evening after they were evicted from Bentley Heather, where they were throwing stones at bystanders.
The council must be shamed for taking action, because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The migrants were there in May, they were driven away and now they are back again.
They came back last night, probably more today. "
He added: "Birmingham council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy that I have to continue paying council tax if the council can't even stop this sort of thing.'
One local resident, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: 'This is ridiculous; we only saw how the last of these migrants left, and a new offensive is already taking place.
This time, the number has grown and the grassland has even been seen as a "horse in memory."
A spokesperson for Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there are unacceptable camps on the land near Streetsbrook Road and we are working with the Solihull police and we will take the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
In gathering evidence, it will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling number 101.
It helps to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them.'
The Weekend Festival is visited by the Minister for Culture, Indrek Saar, among others, who is pleased that real world names have been brought to Estonia.
To the question of why the Weekend festival is so important for Estonians, Saar replies that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the festival to the full in the three days of the festival.
He does point out, however, that the real players in his area have arrived in PÃ¤rnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this musical genre are brought home - this often does not happen in our lives," says the culture minister.
Which festival artists, however, are telling the island itself the most?
I consider myself relatively old-fashioned, and for some kind of old people, surely one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who stood up last night.
According to his record, "after all, at some point, all of us have complicated our own foot," he says.
But he still brings out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Our own Estonian players, of course: Starting with NOOP, and they can be read in a series.
In reality, this concentration of known names is very high, "he says.

Audi to upgrade up to 850,000 diesel vehicles amid criticism from automakers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it was offering software applications to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the BMW chairman, the company believes there are "smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities, including BMW's home city of Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday it would upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
No company described these operations as a recall.
European car manufacturers have been actively promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment installed to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles will increase for car companies, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German carmakers are under thorough investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of harassing powerful car manufacturers and ignoring signs referring to the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which was silent on the use of so-called fraudulent devices, which made it possible to adapt exhaust emissions to regulations by the time the car was tested but withdrew in normal driving.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics subunit of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could go to trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade requirements for European exhaust emissions, thereby expanding an investigation that had focused earlier on the United States.
Audi's involvement in the investigation could be a major blow to Volkswagen, and the manufacturer of luxury cars generates a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
Estonian schools acquire European Union flags for EUR 20 000.
The Ministry of Education plans to buy European Union flags for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
In total, the meters will receive 105x158 centimetres of the European Union flag for 570 educational institutions.
Flags are intended for exhibiting in indoor spaces; they must be carried out in high-quality printing techniques in indoor spaces with an hour's confirmation, brokered by the ERR news portal.
The Lipuvarda label has the text: "A gift to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.

Journalist's murder highlights growing threat in Mexico
Weekly Riodoce workers typically gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in Sinaloa state, soared by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They are told that it is important to change their routine.
Two older writers discuss which seems safer: Whether to bring children into an office that was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard at the top of the room: "Enemies," "neutral," "allies."
They ask reporters to provide the names of every column; there is no need for evidence; impressions and internal feelings are enough.
Drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being employed by the government or cartels, and there is a whole list of males who make it dangerous to cover the chaos in Mexico.
There are no breakthroughs of violence, and the more dead bodies accumulate across the country, the majority of them are journalists and, according to the Committee for the Conservation of Journalists, there have been at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, and there have been at least seven journalists killed so far this year.
The latest deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence makes it deeply felt, although his presence can be perceived everywhere on the facade of the Riodoce building, a large picture of the average finger showing Valdez with the letter "Justice" and two 30s reporters.
The meeting comes less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, their own nightmare, unhappiness, paranoia.
Although a separate Public Prosecutor's Office was set up to deal with journalists' cases in 2010, only two cases have been prosecuted, according to the Committee for the Conservation of Journalists.
As with most annual murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime, which amount to thousands, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodoce's editorial continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without murderers' data and justice, there is not much to gain from the security meeting, Ibarra said.
"It's very stupid to waste your time at this meeting," he says.
"As long as the cause is not known, you will distrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state's capital, Culiacan, on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive only a few quarters before the two men stopped him in the red Toyota Corolla. He was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times.
An armed man drove away in Valdez's car and made a crash near it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left behind by a woman and two adult children.
Rumours spread freely in Culiacan.
However, on the subject of Valdez, there is essentially a silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the most bloody battlefields in the country as rivals struggle to fill a power vacuum.
It does not matter that on the streets of Sinaloa a few people, or even several, are shot every day, or that the cemeteries are dressed in abundance from the mausoleums of double drug kings, which are larger than the homes of many.
Let us forget for a moment that the time of peace refers to the fact that there is only one cartel leading the seaside state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was thoroughly aware of the risks associated with his work, Riodoce's co-founder and chairman Ismail Bojorquez (60) feels immense guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes the killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with Guzman's son-in-law and wartime quarterback Damaso Lopez.
This piece of letters may have infuriated the sons, and the suspected gang members bought all copies of the edition as soon as they reached the newspaper kiosks.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own security after a crackdown was carried out in another newspaper reporting the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had remained alive for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would be there forever.
He worked as a veteran reporter at the newspaper Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said Sinaloa "was impossible to deal with journalism without the drug problem."
The newspaper collected a period of time known for its bold and honest coverage, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish powerful studies without fear of censorship and readers in a fascinating print from which they were able to read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its Latin American coverage.
That same year, Valdez won the Committee for the Conservation of Journalists (AKK) International Press Freedom Award for his courage to follow the Mexican drug story wherever it leads.
He openly admitted he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said, accepting the AKK award.
Last October, he told TV channel Rompeviento TV in an interview that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
'You have to embrace the task that comes with a journalist's office and the other option is to play a fool.
I didn't want to be asked what I was doing in the face of so many deaths or why I wasn't told what was going on.'
The Riodoce collector longed for Valdez, a funny man who robbed like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared embarrassment and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office across the road to the El Guayabo bar and always sat on the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love became fatal to him.
His death has also led them to question how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like being left with these women, their children, their legal business, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs." "
"These things should not have been touched," Bojorquez said.
The result is strong self-censorship and self-restraint, even at the best of times.
Trusting your instincts.
If it's fractured in a suspicious way, keep away.
According to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the fragrance can be cheated... and so it happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules are no longer valid in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply to Tamaulipasis, Veracruz, Guerreros or other states, which are home to lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees got together for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed; a few days before it was revealed that only spyware sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers sought relief from the 40-degree heat in the shadow of the tree.
The government appointed them to guard Riodoce's office in a four-storey building in Culiacan's middle-class neighbourhood.
Some reporters wondered semi-jokingly whether these police officers are among the 50 percent of police officers whose governor himself has been unreliable.
Several months have passed since reporters have travelled to mountainous rural areas where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
Riodoce this week's edition addressed three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor's home town.
And from the prosecutor's office a quarter away, Culiacan, one of the most expensive restaurants, was robbed by a group of people.
There was no official announcement about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it had to be scary when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows, and the restaurant is a hotspot for both drug traffickers and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered by the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
More recently, several IRP governor have been accused of widespread coverage in cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how Guzman's son, wearing the nickname El Chapo, escaped from the military.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have sought Valdez's column to get information from the best sources about the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have already known what had happened," said the 46-year-old Villarreal, whose sparkling body design earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."
Valdez's office has become a storage space for labels and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they could never have expected, activists on behalf of the press said.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez clutched the couple's eyes and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration about another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burnt dead body has been found and, according to officials, it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists have become more vocal across the country, and criticized the organised protest for walking roads and buildings with the phrase "SOS press."
On that day, President Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to gather international support to get justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death in court with the Sinaloa governor, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them by telling the truth.
After that, he asked that he be diverted from reflecting the government's actions elsewhere, worried that anger had impacted his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said Mexican journalists had been "restricted" by organised crime, complicit state officials and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Narcojournalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but are also carried out at the command of politicians and security forces in a twist of organised crime.
Media monitoring group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and state officials last year.
"In Mexico you sue because you want to be quiet," Ramirez said.
Assassinations obviously work verbally.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipasis six years ago.
His dead body was found along with a letter that had probably been written by the cartel Los Zetas: "I am here for my reporters."
Her brunette tresses were styled in a computer-clad ensemble and high-waisted headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others let go as did the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after the murder of their president in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke to the drug cartel publicly on the front page with the headline, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from home states or even from the country.
It is a nerve-racking decision.
It is hard to find a job in exile and they still have to walk down the streets to avoid the dangers.
And sometimes they are driven behind, as was probably the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women at one of Mexico's headquarters in 2015, three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
Those who stay on the pitch and continue to work will have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that reflecting on the drug business would intimidate her.
"Mexico is on its way to hell, and that's why I'm a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been snapped, Riodoce's editors sat in front of the office walking and crying shoulders when suddenly everyone's phones started vibrating.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlani, 19 people were killed in fire exchanges between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by many of the messages left by the cartels found in the area.
From the side of the road there, reporters posted the news using a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
The next day's front office needed a change.
The sirens were evacuated by another fire exchange in the area.
Bojorquez appeared to call police officers at the scene to see if they were vigilant.
If they were afraid, at least they did not show it.
Under a massive portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, on which his average finger is seen across Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff edged in his footsteps.
"How could one think of closure at all," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day Javier was killed, the trainee asked me to send him to the streets to report?"
Dinosaurs used protective colour to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like shape, though quite scary.
Scientists have now unveiled the first findings of an incredible ninety-size creature discovered in the canada mine, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as "dinosaurs Mona Lisa."
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered with his Finns had a red brown colour and his past had been somewhat 'complicated'.
A report published in the journal Current Biology described the creature as "the best preserved Final dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
Fossiili is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the cricket era, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation featured researchers describing it as "truly remarkable."
This vegetarian, covered with Finns, is the best preserved of the type of fossils that has ever been found, according to the journal National Geographic.
It was found by Shawn funk on March 21, 2011, when he was extracted from the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that did not recall the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The discovered fossils were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The next six years were working to get the animal out of the 2,500-pound (1,100-kilometer) plot.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be brought to the public.
"If a little eyes are scratched, you can almost believe he is asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a research fellow at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - dinosaurs," Mona added.
Studying his skin, the researchers found that this plant, while covered with Finns and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely to be significantly threatened by meat-cooked dinosaurs.
This dinosaur with numerous Finns used a red and white protective colour to hide from predators, and applied the shelling technique, which is referred to as obstruction and is also used by many of today's animals.
This, according to experts, allowed the dinosaur to be better absorbed into the surroundings and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him.
This 110 million-year-old family of nodosaurs first came to the news in May and is now visiting the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now studied the creature and gave it a name, according to Borealopelta marketchell Museum Labor's Mark Mitchell, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours on the animal.
Thanks to the astonishingly good preservation of isis, Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the Finns on the body.
They discovered a constellation - a method of protection common in the animal state, which means that the ground side of the creature was dark than the bottom.
Although the eclipse is common, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much larger than the animals living in the shelter today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was sufficiently active in other musculoskeletal dinosaurs, that evolution preferred survival tactics instead of confrontation.
But most of the animals that use modern resistance - such as bowls, sebras or armadills - are much smaller and more vulnerable to prey, which suggests that nodosaurus had to really struggle to survive.
"The vigorous hunting of dinosaurs covered by vast and abundant Finns shows just how dangerous the dinosaurs of the cricket era could be," Brown said.
A chemical analysis of sugary organic compounds also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
The researchers are continuing to create an investigation to get clues about this life, including the preserved contents of its intestine, to find out what the animal would do to its last ear.
They believe that the dinosaur crashed into the river, thereby reaching the flow into the sea, where it sank in front of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to reach much further inland than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable as it is fully covered with preserved Final skin, while it has also remained three-dimensional, maintaining the original shape," Brown said.
'as a result, the animal looks almost the same today as in the age of cricket.
There doesn't have to be a lot of imagination to reconstruct it - it's just enough to kiss the eyes and it looks like he's sleep.'
The crisis era was a time when the Earth was swamped by huge two-foot mobile mushroom dinosaurs - teropods.
Although their all-King Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could hunt down some of his formidable predecessors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and a six-tonne weight monster.
The researchers, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was uprooted after death in the sea and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered by Shawn funk on March 21, 2011, when he was extracted from a Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved FinTech dinosaur in the world, including leather and Finns, and is complete from the pool to the wooden.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five metres) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Its shoulders were invaded by two 20 inches of ora.
The researchers believe that this plant, which is covered with Finns, was sealed through the current western Canada until the flooded river took pride in its open sea.
But the seafaring site of the dinosaur helped preserve its Finns in excellent detail.
The remnants of this particular insulin are so well preserved that the bones of the mystical Final plateau's long dinosaur are still covered by skin remnants.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the journal National Geographic: "This degree of preservation is as rare as a lottery victory.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it looks.
The remnants of the stone's skin still cover the mystical FinTech plates located on the third floor of the building.
A better front foot flew next to him, and five of the thieves climbed upward.
I'll be able to list the Finns on his tall.'
How one activist found the answer to the question "Kelle streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a complete shock.
Just a day after travelling to New York, this St. Louisi resident sat through Airbnb in a rented room on the bed, browsing the phone on Facebook.
He was caught on top of the post by his former school companion.
It read: "Police have just killed an 18-year-old youth and he is still lying in the street."
He was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on his stream, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The constant @ TheePharoah user posts were repeatedly shared on her timeline.
The dirty star from the St. Louisi area posted a real-time photo of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black young man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell tweeted.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away but was seen again later in the evening, which this time reported a gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
Shared photos of the police officer and shouting people, and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and held a banner reading "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a live stream where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a knife-wielding dog.
In another video, another policeman grabbed a gun and shouted: "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell recalls how he caught himself thinking: "It's unusual."
"" It's not the kind of murder we're used to and what we might call typical. ""
I felt terrified at that point.
I was angry and crying. ""
He booked a return flight and travelled home the next day.
Having landed at 23, he went to his father to catch up with his six-year-old daughter and decided they would travel to a two-bedroom Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is a central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Whose streets?"), which will air in cinemas on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and sitcom from the point of view of the people who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell, along with his daughter - who had a floral dress and a matching crown with it - chatted to Ferguson, they talked again about what had happened to them several times earlier in the morning.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for their rights?" He recalls asking himself.
'We are currently driving to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right.'
"I could not take him," Ferrell said later.
'What's happening now is... the culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know it and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He needs to learn about activism and organization and, at the same time, know the different layers of black experience and living conditions, and what we need to do to get free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to grow him in such a way that he does not personally experience blatant racism, he is no different from another black girl.
I feel I would do him a disservice if I protected him from this world.'
The first stop they made when they arrived in Ferguson was on the way to South Florissanti - a place across the road from the police station, which had become a kind of camp site where activists were waiting for news.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who prepared Southern meals.
They put food bags together and helped distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louisi, he was president of the Association of minority nursing students, and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
'i had no organization experience.
It's all just lazing.'
Weeks later, Ferrell met with the film's co-director, Sabah Folayan, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was happening.
Ferrell came up with the question: "Are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited?"
Such scepticism was the result of countless cases in which people - often white - come into the community and try to profit from its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson would not be heard and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already held hands with co-director Damon Davis, the region's artist who was known for activism in connection with the death of prisoners.
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrell and six other local people who were watched by the film's "Whose Streets?" Team after Brown's shooting for years.
"In this documentary, no one is talking for us or us, we are talking about ourselves," Davis said.
'It was important to me how these people are portrayed, because that's how they portrayed me.'
While the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was intended to show that the movement was not about "the relentless leader but the community coming together," as Folayan said - he became the most open player in the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" Documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married to his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he was ready to see the liner.
'But I realised there has to be a certain vulnerability to doing this job and humanising black people.'
What's more, Ferrell's story highlights and refocuses the role of a black gay woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three investigators, who were thinking on social media in 2012 of killing black teenager Trayvon Martin with the hashtag # BlackLivesMatter, are gay.
"In a leading role, black homosexual women have maintained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's precisely because we have to keep fighting on many fronts.
Black gay women "have to bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is really kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women."
He argues, however, that "this is not some kind of thing about creating equal opportunities" - Ferrell was not chosen as the focal point of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who had the right energy," he said.
'But it's no coincidence that she's straight on the front line because there's a lot at stake as a black gay woman living in such hubs.
His energy can be perceived through the screen. "
Meanwhile, news cameras from Ferguson have long disappeared, but racial links between the community and police remain fragile.
The suspended sentence for blocking the road during the Ferrell demonstration will last another 2.5 years.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in the region, which he calls home, simply as a "huge bowl."
Nevertheless, he still considers the important mantra he has eaten in memory since he took to the streets of Ferguson as many as three years ago.
'It's our responsibility to fight for our freedom.
It is our responsibility to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. "
7 tips on how to get over the podcast after The Weekend
Some of the stubborn men's sons will find, after a naughty feast, that it will help.
Or follow the saying 'avoid the bowl, the gun is broken'.
But this is just an inevitable delay and a decent pint on health.
What can you do to make you feel better in the morning after today's and tomorrow's Weekend rally - or any other party - and get over the bowl as painlessly as possible?
Drink water.
Alcohol down and down, after a big party in the morning... or possibly even instead of alcohol.
As the body loses a lot of liquids when using alcohol, it must somehow be recovered.
Along with water, minerals are also washed out of the body and therefore it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after napping, it is particularly good if it is bubble-free or only lightly gagged.
Go to walk.
Certainly, going to the bowl would not cost the grandmother a glimpse of the trees - it could turn out to be a fatal misjudgment.
But the easy walk helps the body remember again what it is like to be alive.
Lying in a tent and sleeping in a bowl is a more time-consuming way of getting healthy.
Give the body energy back slowly and cautiously.
If you are already okay from yesterday's overrun, it is certainly not worth trying to charge a large fat prawn.
Start with, for example, a fresh juice in which the fruit sugar in your body is quietly located.
If the health of the South is already suffering, you could try wedding songs, for example.
And a little later, already selfish.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will release your body from the last water.
As has already been said, water and juice are your friends.
Do not put on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent a bowel in the evening, your tax must deal not only with alcohol but also with paratsetamol or ibuprofen and thus lose performance.
In this way, you will be riding your liver even more, and in the future the poachers will be even worse.
In addition, the painkillers do not last long in the body anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, do not do it with an empty stomach - it will irritate your already torn stomach.
Or, if you do not have a partner, you can do well with yourself.
It works about the same way as walking, but walking does not get an orgasm.
However, avoid too active a pace and turn the potatoes - during the bowl, the physical effort should be moderate.
Make a joke.
With the friends and companions of time, the story of the doll, the path to simple behaviours and a laugh amicably over both himself and others (suffering).
Joke and laughter may not make the poppy, but it is certainly more fun to tolerate the aftershocks.
Once the pohmell goes over anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee are being sought on suspicion of murder
Police say a nationwide search is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who has become suspects after finding the dead body of a man with deadly pushback wounds from one of Chicago's luxury apartments.
According to court documents in Cook County, an arrest warrant for 42-year-old Wyndham Lathemi and 56-year-old Andrew Warren was issued Monday on suspicion of first-degree murder in connection with the death.
26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated pushes, according to the documents.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago police station to the community, the dead body was discovered on July 27.
Police received a phone call and found the victim, whose body had several stomach wounds, on arrival at the Grand Plaza apartment building.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and investigators are treating the pushback as a murder, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of public relations at the university, said in a statement sent by email that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from work and has been banned from entering Northwestern University's districts.
"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant at Oxford University's financial department.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been in contact with British police and are ready to assist US investigative agencies in any way we can."
In addition, the statement read that Warren's colleagues are shocked and want him to give himself up.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the Chicago police department's communications department, urges suspects to report themselves to authorities.
"The police have an idea where they are staying, but we are dealing with identifying the exact location more and more intensively," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, the suspects are being sought by local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic hint that something had happened in the apartment at 1008.
According to police descriptions, it was a gruesome spectacle.
According to Guglielmi, it is not clear whether the event itself also took place on 27 July.
He said security cameras confirm Lathemi and Warren's stay in the building.
"We believe Professor Lathamil and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
The Grand Plaza management sent a letter to residents: "Police are currently working to establish the chronology of events and the background of the victim and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that this was a family dispute."
Start-ups that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce start-ups, but the polls were futile.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, misleading.
And even as he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs an e-commerce company selling hair care products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called on the outside to help.
Start-ups with new types of human resources are emerging, helping companies find out what their employees are feeling.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee involvement, they allow companies to do app surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hot line of complaints and, in some cases, allow keepers.
"There are now tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" Asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City start-ups.
According to Errett, in the three years he has used Glint, he has got a much better picture of what his staff think and feel.
In addition to apps and surveys aimed at solid teams, it offers the company's heat map, which provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing it to identify the causes.
Companies have begun to understand that they need to stay up-to-date with their work culture so as not to become the next Uber, which has been embroiled in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing a harrowing environment that punished those who dared to speak out.
For start-ups like Glint, the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation and compliance could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
The start-up firm Convercent, based in Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, noticed an increase in interest and activity this year against the backdrop of Uber's dubious reputation.
Convercentil has nearly 600 customers, among them Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered itself as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customised impulses, collect real-time confidential responses and look at heat maps from problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous messaging model that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when the CEO is involved, the complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has angered regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercenti.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, the company could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee departure and court cases, even if regulators do not intervene.
RUBY Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has used Convercenti for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and procedures and provide an easy way to communicate with corporations.
If an employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find a phone number or email address at the corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope it would be taken seriously.
It was often a daunting and awkward process, said Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to monitor employee complaints.
However, now that the company uses Convercenti, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices, which did not previously reach managers who acted in offices in other cities or states, can be identified and dealt with more quickly.
"I can get closer to the workers" holistic 360-degree experience, "said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we will protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, perhaps after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical breaches in connection with the Enron scandal.
But it was only when "social media became mature" that the companies realised they could not stop their black laundry from publicly washing the web.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supportive of both start-ups.
Convercenti funded $10 million in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and tola Capital, raising $47 million in the value of the capital it collected.
Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments will come as no surprise, given the interconnection between businesses, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission.
"If people are happy in the company, feel that they are being listened to and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, vice president of general benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convert and Glint.
Investors earn revenue when the companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If the analytical tools of the third party promise to increase the commitment and involvement of employees, it is no wonder they will find support.
The possession of data on employee involvement is important, according to experts in the work culture.
But these data are useless if the company's ex-viewers are not going to do anything with them.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can raise expectations that there will be changes ahead.
And if changes don't happen quickly enough or not at all, it can cause disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask 4,000 proposals, you have to be ready for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consultancy and business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things weren't brought to an end, the staff would think:" Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care? '
According to Errett, Madison Reedil, who now runs six studies among employees, has been able to take action on the same day the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from staff disappointed with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with the problems.
RUBY Tuesdays, however, is collecting new data on workers and it is hoped that, in the long run, it will lead to a longer-term commitment of workers in an industry known for its high workforce turnover.
"If you're not committed to transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
"And when you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies. "
The shining star of the euro area is the Baltics: Incomes are growing fast
While the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes, referring to the ECB report.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, total economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
This success is due to low levels of debt, rapidly improving institutions and business and free market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic States, along with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where reactor GDP per capita from the purchasing river is significantly closer to the EU average," the central bank announced.
Although the aim is for the total economic output per capita to be equal to the richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was just 2 / 3 of the average of the 15 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led fans to seek better wages from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, local residents are not at all enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of people in Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of those surveyed thought this about the economies of their countries.
NCAA decision to cancel two-day tournament makes Bruins days long
The clock is almost 23 when trophies UCLA footballers stop to talk at the edge of a new exercise pitch in the team's university town.
Some of them have been wearing a selfie shirt, revealing their training camp's first day of efforts on the back of the highway.
For much of the team, these weekends offer a midday break.
Players taking part in summer courses will be heading back to the pool for final exams after three hours of training, before returning to the Wasserman football centre at 6.30am the next morning.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday's game on Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the trenches twice a day to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer - at least until the final exams to one side on Friday.
For that reason, UCLA's three first innings were timed to start at 7: 15 p.m. to fit into the players' already tight schedule.
The switch from two training sessions a day means more of a trendy day - the start of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead of last season and for the first time during Mora's six Westwood season.
They have 18 trenches scheduled until August 20 before the official preparation for September's opening game against Texas A & M.
Mora says he is in favour of the NCAA rule change, though it adds another item to the players' busy schedule.
"They have a huge load in three or four days and it's a serious challenge," Mora said.
"And they break themselves through this challenge; they're struggling, they're nice young.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it's really enjoying.'
Once the camp has ended, UCLA's training will be closed, which is not an easy task, however, given the clear view of their pitches from the nearby parking lot and the side-by-side Luskin Centre, a high-class hotel, which has already been hit by the gates from the surrounding safety net.
The Bruins players will occupy the hotel this weekend, but Mora admitted there could be problems with free rooms during the season.
"We take security measures," Mora said.
'It's a real concern and it's not at all exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and there's training in the film.
If you have a record of training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we're going to use a security team there and 8 in the parking lot.
We will do our best by using what we have.
I try not to worry much about that.
We have a plan in place. ""
The election union of Savisaare-Ivanova, who was born to the Central Party, and Kristiina Ojuland, who had been expelled from the Reform Party to join the forces of Maria Kaljuste, will appear to be taking part in local elections this year at least as much as political parties in the local elections.
However, the titles will be counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who will stay with Saturn?
How small the advocacy group of Edgar Savison has waned can be awakened by the events organised in honour of his electoral union.
One member of the national assembly, some former and current central parties and many unfamiliar faces - will this be the composition of an electoral union?
And is there any reason why some of Savisaare's faithful followers and friends are being prevented from standing in Tallinn?
On the roof of the town hall, a music video for the Russian-language podcast, in which the parent of the LasnamÃ¤e district is involved; and in every sense, the original computer game in which Prime Minister, JÃ¼ri Ratas, is trying to avoid, for the first time, the votes of the electors of the 16- and the first time in the ballot box?
We look forward to hearing the perception of the other parties in the youth election campaign.
If Kanal 2 or TV3 viewers watch a black square instead of entertainment from the beginning of August, there are two options: Accept that from now on, only ETV, ETV2, ETV +, Tallinn TV.
There are probably also those who at first openly welcome the advertising-free television experience, but ultimately - albeit reluctantly - pay for television and advertisements.
The deafening music, the lunar nation and the rubbish left on the streets are the unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
However, if you do not want to be part of it yourself, it is worth going home to discover the home instead of painstaking - and leaving the bedroom for a fabulous amount to the festival guests.
Washington changes green card rules
Media outlets quote President Donald Trump as saying a new U.S. immigration plan is planned that will change the rules of the green card.
The plan envisages a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people a year, stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the president supports them.
The bill is going to be debated in the two chambers of Congress.
'This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money as it changes the way the US grants green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and will replace the current program.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the funds to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, according to US media outlets.
Siberian Seto's young people move to the city, pensioners back to land.
Yevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of famous Seto gold miners along the former Maana River.
He works from home 140 kilometres away in a makeshift suburb of Kuvai as a gold-collar driver.
It's a tough job: Two months in a row without rest, 12 hours of work and then only 10 days at home and back again.
In the three years developed by Artellis, Anatoli has seen gold only once.
"There is a hard time: Going inside is thoroughly controlled so that the vibe does not lead, and by going out, that the gold does not take it," says Anatoli.
Mare Piho was speaking in the village of Haida with local Seto Jaan, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The archaic culture still preserved by the Siberian setode is also beginning to affect the home-sects, because it is just so staggering, thinks the most thoroughly distant setos studied by Piho Mare.
This year marks the 30th anniversary of his first research trip to Siberia.
During this time he has been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many people still migrated to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in order to gain land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I would argue that 8 000.
I calculated it according to the stories of the men of the Siberian Seto, who have also thought about it.
It is difficult to say precisely because, at the time, up to 30 people may have come in one group, but the passport was only given to the man.
The passport was given to only one, but there were children, nurses and other female relatives.
Look how big the territory was here!
It was several times larger than the historic Setown.
After all, it needed to be educated, managed in some way.
The Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (worship), gold mines, industry.
In New Petseri, for example, many Setos later went to work in the classified city of Krasnojarsk-45 (where the Soviet power built a uranium storage plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did Setos make up the majority of the population in the region at the time?
Yes, they lived compact.
In addition, there was a long tradition of getting married and having many children.
Seven to eight children in the family were common.
How much of the Siberian setode culture differed and different from that of the native setode?
They are different, though what was brought here was never the same there.
They brought a lot of popular ideas.
They then made their own (popular ideas), but they always made a distinction between what was brought along and what was done here.
Climate change strongly influenced the traditional clothing of seafood, because it is colder here.
The food changed.
For example, Setomaal meat was salt, but here it was simply frozen.

The bond with the mother was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is going to give back there, it is going to affect them.
The girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho is thinking of the people of the Estonian setode delegation who came to the village of Haida at the beginning of July on the day of the kingdom of Seto and lived in their homes for four days - J. P.
What's still here, it's staggering.
"It's super easy for Tapale to come and go, too, because the city has a great location: The railway hub and the intersection of roads," says Tapalt-based opera writer Reigo Tamm.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural spaces, and the pizza will be every corner.
Kill is a top-topped city!
Along the White River, which runs through the city, there is a small island where the tapals tend to hold a meal party.
"It doesn't look like this beautiful place from the train window," muses Reigo.
Anyone who is not afraid of cold water can swim in this river because the river is full of sources.
I have been swimming there, I can do it!
The rolling of the river can be long and simply romantic - it can bridge the flow of the river and think about life in front and behind.
I, too, have been walking there with my bride.
The opera columnist Tamm, apart from everything else, has gone to the river bank between the three bridges to get used to his gardens: "For this place to be in the city, no one may be responsible if their own stories are overwhelmed."
"There is a wonderful view from the mountain to Tapa, but there are also Terminers where you can run, skip the winter and now, for example, play a golf course - the golf course is done, the heels.
The old pros go there with their keepers, of course, but I have not yet been able to play there.
You will probably have to invite my colleague, Rasmus KULL Tapale, because he has experienced a discgolfing player and has heels.
Perhaps he is lending to me!
Reigo and MÃ¤nnikumÃ¤gi were inseparable from the times of the current opera columnist's childhood.
At least during skiing hours.
There are a lot of tears, disappointments left on this mountain, and you can in my sporting life.
Not to mention broken bells and smells.
"The entire central city is now full of construction, all of it becomes unknown," approves Reigo.
Kill the old and tired whale building, however, is a very attractive place where summer discoveries are played.
I am pleased that in 2012 the head of the R.A.A.M, MÃ¤rt Meos, accepted my idea and had to make my own theatre in the vacant summer theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with "Aleksei Karenin" has just come to an end, on 11 August the railway station will be "Elluwakening" when the old whale building moves around in the 1980s.
"From 11 to 13 August, the days of the town of Tapa, where the open home cafes of the vacant building have been awakened and there are riding cultural events, including the popular Hall," says Reigo.
In a tiny three-bedroom house on May 1, the museum has been in place since 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are well and information enormously," praises Reigo's place, which is full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on rail and warfare.
Reigo muses that if Tapal goes through all the recommended paintings, the stomach will go dry for a long time, but luckily the small town is full of cafÃ©s.
"We have such good meals, and when you sit in cafÃ©s, you sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad," she describes.
Educated and young soldiers who come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafÃ©s, so there is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home town, but there is such an international community around.
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we are moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal tent in Greece
The TV channel BTV quoted the Foreign Ministry as reporting that two Bulgarians were taken into custody in Greece for illegal bricks.
Police arrested a group of illegally ordered people on the Sithonia peninsula on the morning of 1 August, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but an investigation is currently underway.
The Foreign Ministry told television channel bTV that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free bricks and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone caught on holiday in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
The wolves who teach the puppies are in the process of breaking the sheep.
Farmers in Hiiumaa will once again have to give the wolves the 'learning material' of their herd after a year's break - the wolves who have taught the puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves in the county of Hiiu have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and eight have been injured, writes the Hiiu page.
Last year, the corresponding number was only three, up from 124 a year earlier.
There is also data from the Environment Agency that wolf pests were not born in Hiiumaa last year, and information from the Hiiumaa hunting council that two wolf pests have been fixed on the island this year.
In the middle of the night on Monday, wolves broke into the village of Emmaste in the village of Kabuna, killing 15 sheep and injuring 18 survivors from a lab party.
In the early hours of Wednesday morning, wolves spotted a sheep in the pasture of the village of Reheselu and badly injured another who had to be taken to an emergency stop.
Rules for the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act to the coordination front.
The amendment to the law exempts the establishment of a separate database for both GM crop locations and handlers, using a plant health register in the future.
In addition, the GM crop management company will be subject to the obligation to have a prior agreement with the person dealing with beekeeping within the prescribed radius.
Although GM crops are not currently cultivated in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non-GM crops.
This is at least as long as there is no decision to declare Estonia GMO-free, "said Sigmar Suu Kyi, head of the plant health department at the Department of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden on both the private and public sectors," Suu Kyi added.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the data collection and handling training of GM crop locations and handlers in GMOVS, lays down requirements for the handling of GM crops and for the commencement of economic activities.
Specifically in relation to beekeeping, the GM crop growers will be replaced by the current obligation to inform beekeepers about the cultivation of GM crops with the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeepers before starting cultivation.
The draft law has been sent for coordination with ministries.
All interested parties will have the opportunity to familiarise themselves with this in the draft information system and, if they so wish, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The proposed changes will affect, in particular, those active in the plant farming sector, beekeepers and the Agriculture Agency.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop is authorised for cultivation - maize MON 810.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in the cultivation of GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no corn juice in Estonia, a European corn borer, to which the maize line MON 810 is resistant.
Also, the varieties of this maize line are breeding in the southern regions, and this May is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In order to obtain certainty, the Department of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect pollution from potential GM organisms in the seeds of various sugars, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of samples taken showed that the seeds were not native and the study concluded that the seeds of rapeseed, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that genetically modified crops are not deliberately cultivated in Estonia, and it has also been confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Maticu in form of 'genius'
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited a 'genius' in the form of Nemanja Maticu after the midfield player made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, who was bought from Chelsea for Â£40million, started in Dublin in the last seasonal pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday with a 2-1 victory in the Premier League, impressing in a defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to play in the attacking midfield.
But having stayed away from the Blues' seasonal pre-season Asian tour, Maticul desperately missed the match and he held on for only 45 minutes; that, according to Mourinho, must be fixed before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant mindset - he has the mindset of football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him achieve the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new collaborators Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviva stadium at the start of the season, and Mourinho began to quietly lay down his uniform for the starting man at the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed the club had already done an "excellent job" by signing contracts with three of his four priority options.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three out of four," he added.
'i'm even happier if they can make the top four but they've worked hard for me.'
Another warm-up son got a foot on the side of the GSM Embassy on 1 August and this time in Muhus.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird observer living in the Ring, he became the first godson to be fitted with the Ring, and this woodland is already flying around, has left the wreckage.
This is because the Ring does not have fertile fields, writes Islands HÃ¤Ã¤l.
This Tuesday, relatively late in the day, the devil was accompanied by another godson, and this on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of favourites is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a curator was supplied with a knife called the Mati GSM Embassy in Ring, Turkey.
"His dealings are all vivid on the Internet: How he went to winter in Spain, coming back for a long time on the German-Polish border, and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
British inventor allowed to install microchip in his body to escape handbag in house and car
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he could just open his front door, get into the office and even launch a car.
33-year-old Steven Northam was allowed to install a tiny chip between his fingers and name finger and is now offering this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with consultant-anesthesiologist Dr Geoff Watson of the Royal Hospital in Winchester, Hansfield, to ensure the installation procedure meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip installed on cats and dogs, and the procedure takes just 30 seconds.
Northam's company is also changing the locks of houses and cars to make them compatible with the chip, asking for Â£300 for one lock.
This married father of one child has installed the technology now both at home and in his car on the BMW Z4, which kicks off when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House showdown cost taxpayers thousands
According to military documents disclosed to the magazine TIME, the White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter for an event celebrating American production last month cost taxpayers a staggering $24,000.
Green and white paint Sikorsky VH-3D, which is described as "Marine One" during the president's pardon, was a central attraction for the event presenting American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike pence and senior White House officials announced industrial products from all 50 states during their tour.
The helicopter, built in Connecticut, was extinguished along with a fire car from Maine, Wisconsin, and a two-storey truck made in Mississippi.
According to documents from the helicopter's self-defense attorney Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House's military office called for a helicopter.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually high-profile event," the HMX-1 commander said the day before the event in an email to his superiors, the naval's leading officer.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive in the southern courtyard at around 7: 15 a.m. on the morning of 17 July and will remain there until the straw is cleared between 18 and 21 on the same evening.
Included was the fact that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, a return flight would require a second eyepage due to working time restrictions.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, and the escapee's security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its time on the ground.
In the documents given to the magazine TIME, it was not possible to find out whether the second ekipage was eventually needed or not.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether this event could violate the provision.
"We asked if it violates the Hatch Act, and we were told not to violate," the commander wrote.
"It looks like you have no choice," the lead officer's deputy replied.
The White House declared the event an "official event" made in America, and the Hatch Act would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The president supported the health care reform efforts that were under discussion in the Senate at the time and praised efforts to rein in government regulations.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically lucrative purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely as a photograph is unusual.
Trump was caught in the spotlight in February when his first campaign event in Florida, Melbourne, aired background on the president's plane, and his Twitter account was uploaded with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"The white house is very pleased with the display" made in America, "which represented products from all 50 states prepared by American workers from American materials," said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 teams often make test flights around Washington and on the southern side of the aisle to get used to waking up to the US president's White House with a centimetre punch.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 tests in the White House backyard.
According to the official, the flight was believed to be the norm for the "American-made" flight crew's training flights this month.
The escapee helicopter was flying for an additional 11 hours on that day for "unrelated support missions" with the president.
According to the White House, none of the other exhibits of the event were burdened with taxpayer walkouts.
According to a spokesperson for Sikorsky, the company was not involved in organising the excursion on the southern side of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not retain budget documents on the president's flights, and the exact costs of the event are hard to figure out.
But according to the Ministry of Defence's 2017 hourly prices, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
The escapade documents stated the length of the flight from its main base from the naval Quantico airport to Virginian in both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House argues that the real cost of using a helicopter is well below that amount.
"Calculating taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated compensation rates include staffing, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that will be taken into account for annual appropriations," the statement read.
According to a 2015 RAND survey, the Ministry of Defence's compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they do cover the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracts.
The White House's former spokesman Sean Spicer at the time defended the use of a helicopter at the event.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security and that there are presumably hundreds, if not even thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So of course it's right to highlight that.'
It is not clear whether or not Trump encountered a helicopter in the southern courtyard as part of the event, but he sat behind the wheel of the fire car.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's representatives, tweeting a joke to media outlets about the company's products in his personal aircraft park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of their products."
Grit Å adeiko - through tears came peace and joy
The 2011 MMil Daegus hit Å adeikot in the last field, an 80m run on a foot ramp, and the stadium was moved away with a catcher.
Just before that, he had received a null in the distance from the universe held in China.
The 2012 Helsinki Emmy was ruined by a hamstring injury, but in a debut season in London, he received 60,013 points in 23 appearances.
The misfortune, however, continued.
The 2013 Moscow midfielder suffered an ankle injury during a stint on the Estonian record on the opening day of the tournament.
Two years later, he received 15th place on the Beijing Mile and played the Olympic Form, but this was more than a disappointment for the sportsman.
The heaviest comeback was passed by Å adeiko only last year, when the result was not recorded at first in the distance of the Amsterdam Emil.
I would just like to put together a proper multi-contest once or once.
Once, "sprayed Å adeiko.
Worse was yet to come: A month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was already plagued by a resurgence at the first barrier.
Time had to be taken down - did the seven matches go on at all?
Is the two-day effort still worth all that?
Neiu thought for a long time but found peace.
I was able to clean my head
It is relatively difficult to describe this experience, but I have thought that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Luckily, there was time to heal himself and to clean his head.
"I knew I couldn't put the ball in the bag yet," Å adeiko says of his self-defense.
I was able to turn a clean sheet and move on with a new kick.
According to trainer Anne Nagorno, it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the negligent, but she realised that, above all, the sportsman himself must find out.
After all, he was so buried by everyone.
It was hard to endure.
"Grit, however, said he doesn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth," says Nagorno.
Now there is some peace in him.
He does it for his own joy.
The tournament came back in May when Å adeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the GÃ¶tzis multi-contest.
In a high-level contest, he improved the personal top spot in the bullpen by nearly a metre (13.89) and ran a record-breaking time in the barrier race.
Then the multi-contestant felt that it was by no means a capacity ceiling, but that only the primary hunger of the contest was erased.
Nagorno, who has guided him for years, says that Å adeiko is a black student.
He's a ready sportsman, he's good at training.
If something does trouble or is wrong, he says it immediately.
He knows his own body and trusts his sense of self.
That is what we must build on.
I cannot say what exactly we have to do, and we will follow it.
Å adeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not the one who trenches the maximum," he says, and vows that the most important thing is getting the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
Loved ones' baby happiness makes jokes
Good emotions have also been offered to Å adeiko by the good fortune of loved ones.
Both his former trainer Maris Nagorno and sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-contestant has received support from new weather citizens.
"It's been pretty interesting," says Å adeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking equates to "training" in the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is such a great wine fan that he believes - wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it's not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but instead about the "very active" wine tasting process.
By splashing the glass, smelling the wine, enjoying it and perceiving the aftertaste, we put our brain to work to create a taste for the wine.
According to Sheperd, the blood molecules don't really contain the taste, but the taste arises from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He brings, by comparison, how the brain "sees" colours.
"The taste is not in wine, the taste creates a taste of wine," says Sheperd.
The things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender and even the amount of syllabus that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, advises that wine is not in order to be full of drink.
"There needs to be more in action," he says.
If you take too much of a blonde, the system is oversaturated.
Excessive wine drinking can do harm to the brain instead of benefits - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glass of wine, memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity.
10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector pay less than their colleagues
Data from Personnel search company fontes reveal that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than their colleagues.
The ten percent pay gap is between men and women, writes the portal's genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the Fontese ICT sector pay survey.
A total of 8,577 posts were examined.
63% of the posts were employed by men.
"While only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and that the rest of the companies believe that there is no pay gap, in reality, compared to similar jobs, the average monthly salary for men is 10% higher than that of women, and the total annual salary for men is 8% higher than that of women," said Fontese analyst Ilmar Nordic.
'Narcose 'season 3 promotional clip: Now that Pablo Escobar is gone, Netflix hitmaker takes centre stage at Cali cartel
Despite being revealed as Pablo Escobar's killer in the second season of "Narcos," the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth season has received confirmation from the streaming service, and the first has already been completed with a promotional clip featuring a series of new paintings.
In the third season, DEA turns its attention to the world's richest drug company - the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful crusaders, "like the Fortune 500 company," simply with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) of that brain, Pacho Herrera.
In a newly released promotional clip, Pedro Pascali sees the return of Javier Pena, a player who is recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement to help in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Narcos" will open on September 1.
Afghan democracy depends on women's role in politics, says UN
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday that elections can only represent the nation if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said hundreds of women stand in local council elections, three women stand as vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The emphasis on the importance of the role of women cannot be exaggerated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and can only be credible if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The local council elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban, for its part, has threatened an electoral process that coincides with a transition period when the role of international military operations becomes an adviser.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is calmly handed over from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes every thing more acute, both large and small.
There is always too little common time, but the trend with the rings provides a good opportunity to combine meeting, game, proximity and load.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you cruise in the summer, live hangovers will always accompany you and will impatiently remind you of your fine voice: "Let's do the trend now!"
Start with warmth - it is very good to have a normal gold game or slip along the beach.
The piece is the bedrock of survival in the form of shoes and tuhara - who would then like to take the shape of a sandwiched sand cog from the waves during the summer?
It is wonderful to have children instead of chicken!
Firstly, it is safe and convenient, and the weight is slowly growing at the same pace as the training force.
The advanced will also be able to make villages with quite large children.
The child trails the balance, reads the records and feels fun about the opportunity to walk high and be important.
Larger children can, at the same time, make their own fuels.
The scope of the movement is put in place by touching the ground and pulling up the hands.
Keep your fingers straight, ask for the minivan to be properly captured.
A child can read records and feel like a trainer.
The plank is super casual, but a hopelessly boring exercise for a child.
But it's easy to make fun of it!
Game-plank: Take a long plank column from which to fold.
In fact, it is more difficult than usual, but much more fun to do if, in the meantime, you can give a friend a hand.
To add the load, you can stay on the plank, plug on the turf, and walk around in this position.
Extra fat can sit on the hips of a child, but this exercise offers fun for all children.
While the crabs on the sand sizzle, the trimmings, tuhar and quirky muscles get a load like an infection.
The child is placed on his feet in such a way that his body fat is distributed equally in front and behind.
Security can be kept out of hands.
Squeeze your feet and sip straight up.
Good luck can fly, have fun, strike the balance and be in difficulty.
The life of a little trainer is exhilarating when he gets a little Musi in every confession.
The extra load is provided by the sifting of the legs in advance.
Check that the back remains in a neutral position.
The children themselves have a lot more fun to do in the bathroom and playground.
Cook with hand and pulse.
Monitor the child's safety, generation position, and keep your back in a neutral position.
All the children's favourite and great fun!
For the parent at the same time, a really effective whole body trend.
The sports facilities were Ott (10), SÃ¤de (8), Once (4).
From the Philippines to a wide world, in other words, a trip to the heart of fashion fans
The beaked bags are a summer classics which, in recent years, have become a product of their own, which one of the right summers even has to run out of hand and which, despite its modest origin, traders.
A red bag from the shoulders is probably one of the things that has existed at any time in life and which has not generated much emotion.
It simply exists, and if it is not, then nothing is broken.
Now, however, beer bags are making a real win, and fashion fans have been exchanging their sophisticated designer bags for the summer months instead of simple beers in red bags.
It is not only a coastguard, but today it is just as popular as a street house, and more courageous women even walk into the office.
It is worth making it clear at this point, however, whether such a summer fog is still sitting on the top, or whether it is worth putting a wet and laptop in a slightly more formal way.
The celebrity actress, however, has made a real summer love for women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion logists, the first thing that stands out is that the fashion gurus take the first thing on a holiday trip to the local market and acquire a few bedrooms, then a whole holiday.
Some bloggers are even so generous that they buy bags from the market for a bigger pile and sell or give away them to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that the demand for bags is so high among readers that, in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go to each other in order to become the happy owner of a few bags.
In some ways, this kind of madness is understandable, because the characters are these times when, in fashion, it is possible to buy a thing that has risen to a hitmaker for just a few hundred euros.
It is true that clever traders have also discovered a simple way of making money here, and so the more sophisticated luxury brands are also selling straw bags for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Probably still so that wealthier customers don't have to feel as simple as those who promenade around with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy a Dolce & Gabbana beer bag worth more than a thousand euros.
For the interpretation of Chanel's bedroom, however, you can walk out for â‚¬6,000.
Unlike most movies, however, the beachwear didn't come from any of the big fashion items, but their story got off to a much more distant start.
Indeed, beer bags reportedly originate far from the Philippines, from where they have been transferred to a wide range.
Bundling from the shoulders is primarily an export business there, and it is very often not the case that local people are going round with them.
Arguably, the boxing technique dates back to the 14th century and is quite similar to the usual basketball.
However, because the beetroot does not have to be as strongly red as a basket, it can be intertwined with muscles and other materials that make the bag more personal and, by extension, more actrative.
For example, in recent times there have been particularly trendy bags with red-coloured paintings or leather strips.
In particular, however, the handbags can be sent to actor Jane Birkin, the biggest red-haired beer fan of whom had not been seen before.
Namely, she was matching a beige bag with all sorts of clothing buns and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival for much of it.
The popularity of bags nowadays does not play a smaller role, however, because taking care of them is a cocktail and, unlike all other sugars, they do not have to be cared for by special means, but also by water and wet water.
As in the case of trendy tracks, apart from the classic appearance, the brands have come up with all sorts of interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you can acquire a red riddle or a tiny bowl of beer.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic beer bag never goes out of fashion, but it does.
But what, then, is the classic beer bag?
For centuries, the classic has been regarded as such a beautifully red coat that resembles its style of basketball, stands open and has short, as well as shoulders, pitches.

Man missing in Saaremaa three days ago was found dead
The pair left their home in KÃ¤rla on Wednesday night in an unknown direction.
Aarega had the last contact on the phone yesterday, Friday night, and the phone positioning gave the man a seat in West Saare, the village of Mings, from where he was searched by helicopter at midnight, and with dogs in the early morning.
His phone then became empty and the man's location could therefore no longer be identified.
Police continued the search this morning.
Police thank everyone who helped find Aare.
GMB worried about investment in McVitie's Glasgow factory
The trade union is awaiting confirmation from cookmaker McVitie's executives about long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent on the future of the Tollrock site's investment.
The plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
McVitie's owner Pladis said they had invested more than Â£5 million in the site over the past few years.
Workers were employed there, and the trade union chairmen 'are the first to hear' when something changes in the activities of the factory.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland appealed to McVitie to "allay concerns that the funding is not being used to modernise production lines."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we don't get clarity from the head of the site about Tollrock's business needs and future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow, as an essential pillar for decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social exclusion.
So in terms of jobs, pay and well-being in the east of Glasgow, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rise in living costs and the chronic decline in production, McVitie is desperately needed. "
A spokesperson for the site said: 'The Tollrock site received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will respond directly to him as we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between employees and GMB representatives in Tollrock, where a number of issues were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years we have invested more than Â£5 million in the Tollrock site, most of it has gone into production lines and improving operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollrock as a production site, and if there should be any change in the activity of the object, workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it. "
Did PSG warn Barcelona about their approach to Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on efforts to attract Neymar into their ranks by making an offer of Â£189 million for his exit - but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record conquest?
This thoughtful approach has opened the summer transfer window and the Ligue 1 club are ready to break more than double the current world record set by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for Â£89 million last season.
Once the switch is completed, Neymar will, as a result, become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, who will receive a salary of more than Â£500,000 a week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona are, of course, angry at both the approach and Neymar's free-kick, although a source close to Catalani's board confirms the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his Santos arrival in 2013.
But has the PSG president warned the football world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi severely warned all clubs thinking about recruiting some of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch some of our players, we will confront them and contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
'We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to enter into a contract with some of our players, they have to face the consequences. "
Barcelona appear to have taken over the border as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfield player Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear they would not let the Italian leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could face a backlash as a result of that interest by losing one of their expensive assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit
"Brexit seriously threatens to strike a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," warned VARADKAR on his first visit to Northern Ireland since his inauguration in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods, said VARADKAR.
"This is our vision for the future: Building bridges, not borders," he stressed.
According to Varadkari, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and, as it fails, to remain part of the European single market.
It would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the UK, the Irish prime minister explained.
Noting that such a deal existed with Turkey, VARADKAR said: "Surely we could have this with Britain."
The alternative to that would be a return to customs items that would declare historical division and political failure.
"A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace," the Irish prime minister said.
He called Brexit a "challenge for our generation" and warned that the result could affect every aspect of everyday life in Northern Ireland.
The Irish prime minister met with leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland during a visit to Belfast.
Through his first half-long triathlon, MÃ¤rt Avandi: Ironman's ability to pass anyone.
The largest triathlon festival in the Baltic States was held in the winter capital today, when about a thousand triathletes from more than thirty countries took part in the half-long Ironman competition.
The 70.3 mile distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, MÃ¤rt Avandi also completed the first triathlon of his life.
"I thought it would prove difficult and in the end it was difficult," said Avandi in the finishing.
Despite the complexity, Avandi acknowledged that, in fact, the triathlon is affordable for almost everyone.
"Not the distance will kill, but the pace will kill," he said, suggesting that at an affordable pace, almost everyone will reach the finishing line.
Except Ott Sepp: "With Oti's fury, everything is fine, but alas, he can't swim."
Avandi had been working aggressively on the trend since February.
Start at 4-5 hours a week, but later on for 10 hours a week.
With a time of 05: 34: 12, he reached 27th in the overall count.
Although Avandi lost both Raio Piiroja (time 04: 59: 53) and JÃ¼rgen Ligg (time 05: 06: 37), he won other so-called 'prominent classes'.
Tanel Padar, who was a "good role model" last year, lost to Avan in seven minutes (time 05: 41: 54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05: 50: 23), Kalev
The overall winner of the men's count of the OtepÃ¤Ã¤ stage, which is part of the Ironman series, was chronicled by the German John Moldan with 3: 58: 27, and the Estonians had the best Ivo Greater 04: 14: 09.
Among the women, the Dane, Helle Frederiksen, triumphed with a time of 04: 24: 01, while Maria JÃ¤nese, who lost to Frederiksen for nearly half an hour, was defeated by 04: 58.
Avandi passed the 1.9 km swimming distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
Out of the water, he came in 410th position.
