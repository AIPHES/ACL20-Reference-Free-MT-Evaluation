Four members of the Kemerovo gang were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the postal newspaper, in Spain, the police detained Slava Gulevich, the head of the so-called Kemerovo in downtown Estonia, known as Slava Kemerovsky, in the criminal world.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of a court.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects detained in Estonia into custody.
They are suspected to be members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal association between the ages of 27 and 57, who mainly commit drug crimes.
The alleged head of a criminal association was detained in Mijases, Spain, in Malaga province.
Three men were detained as suspects in Estonia, one of them being a leading figures in the criminal association according to the collected data, and two are members of the criminal community.
The data collected point to there was a clear division of tasks and roles within the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal community's activities was to commit drug crimes and thereby earn the proceeds of crime, "commented the head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case, the state prosecutor, Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out increasing the circle of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have previously been caught in of interest to law enforcement agencies, and some of them have been serving sentences for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish counterparts has been a key priority throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," prosecutor Verte commented.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said the detentions were preceded by a preliminary investigation that lasted nearly a year and a half.
"Long-term work materialized in the first half of the week and at the same time we detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that officers were assisting in the detention in Spain.
For years now, we have good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can also get them from on the part of Europe, "Leis said.
The information collected so far shows unequivocally that men suspected of being at liberty can continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor's office requested their their arrest and been approved the.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting his surrender to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation in this criminal case.
The pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case are conducted by the Central Criminal Police's organized crime office and run by the Public Prosecutor's Office
The Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of racketeering in 2005 and punished him with five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world the then downtown leader, following Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian downtown in the early 1990 s when he began dealing with blackmail in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes who operated at various hotels and demanded a monthly rooftop tax from businessmen.
International joint operations, of proceeds of crime and court rulings in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest judgments, the so-called Dikajev of eight accused persons who confiscated proceeds criminal of EUR 80 000,, or the judgment against nine persons in that Igor Aleynikov set up a criminal case association in 2006 aimed at the illegal trade in cigarettes and the crime the crime of trafficking in human beings in Eastern Viru County and Southern Estonia.
The confiscated proceeds of crime are close to EUR 71 500.
in In these criminal cases, success has been ensured by police officers exchanging information and evidence every day with their foreign counterparts and, if necessary, acting together in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns against travelling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The NAACP travel mark issued by the State of Missouri, valid until 28 August 2017, calls on all Afro-American travellers, visitors and missourians to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious as they move around the state, given the whole of dubious race-based events that have taken place recently across the state and also been pointed out here."
Naacp said the group urged the travel warning to be issued by both the recent Missouri law, which makes it harder to win discrimination-related cases, and the fact that minorities are unequally targeted by state vigilantes.
'People's civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled from tea fat to because of the colour of their skin, they are beaten or killed, "NAACP Missouri branch president Rod Chapel told The Kansas City Star.
'We've never had such complaints before.'
This is the first such warning issued by an organisation concerning the US State.
The group cited events such as racist insults at the direction of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died earlier this year in half-suspicious circumstances after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state and Missouri police took him into custody without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that in the state, black drivers cars are 75% more likely to be stopped than those of drivers.
"The comment is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and work colleagues about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be ready, whether that means taking up caucus money or informing relatives that they are going through the state."
The latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program documented 100 hate crimes in Missouri in 2015, which places the state in 16 th place in the state's cross-section for similar offences.
The travel warning is also in response to Missouri's new law, which makes it harder for the company to sue for housing or work in search of discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union Taj ACLU had issued earlier travel comments about Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because, according to the ACLU, it increases racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have begun to use this measure as a counter-reaction to certain US-based laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different levels of hepatitis A, B, C, D and E.
All of these viruses evoke acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, there is a chronic hepatitis B and C, which can continue to develop into the cirrhosis of the liver, i.e. the liver wrinkling and liver cancer.
Kuulo Kutsar, epidemiology advisor the health authority, says that symptoms acute hepatitis disease are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, selflessness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, pathetic stool, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and the collusion of skin and limb.
The popular name of the liver inflammation also comes from yellow disease.
In children, hepatitis can run without the disease.
Different types of liver inflammation can only be determined on the basis of laboratory study data.
Acute hepatitis can switch to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without a disease phenomenon, meaning a person may know nothing about their dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Mr Kutsar identifies detail different forms of hepatitis and describes their course more.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from the infected person stool on the hands and hands to foodstuffs, surfaces, objects, getting into mouths and consuming drugs.
risk of hepatitis infection - that is, family members and carers of patients at risk, people chronic liver diseases, people sex with the infected, men who sex with men, drug addicts, travellers to countries with with high hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccinating, in particular by recommending vaccination for people travelling widely and at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, the daily fulfilment of hygiene requirements is important: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruit and vegetables before consuming food.
Hepatitis B viruses spread through contact with the blood of the sick person, injection of drugs, tattooing, August, use of blood-contaminated human (toothbrushes, shaving tools), the donor donor, sex with a hepatidly person, and the good-faith mother mother to the fetus/newborn.
of drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men who sex with men, infected mother newborn, sick family members and carers, health care, rescue workers and police officers and, travellers visiting countries with high rates The hepatitis At of hepatitis b infections injected B.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, people can be vaccinated; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, as well as those suffering from chronic liver diseases, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures of hepatitis B include: refraining from alien hygiene and manicure tools, other sharp tools and needles, tattooing and August, and using a condom in cases the use of infected sex or avoiding sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan in Estonia and free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses spread through contact with the blood of a sick person, injection of drugs, tattooing, August, use of blood-contaminated objects, donor, sex with the a hepatidic person, and from good-faith mother to the fetus/newborn.
At risk of hepatitis C infection include injections of drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men taking sex with men, infected mother newborn, sick family members and carers, health care, rescue workers and police officers, people with HIV infection, and travellers visiting countries with high hepatitis C.
Hepatitis C preventive action is: refrain from the use alien hygiene and manicure tools, other sharp tools and needles, tattooing and August, and the use a condom in cases of infected sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus which reproduces in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
This leads to hepatitis D infection with hepatitis B or superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses spread in contact with blood and other body fluids, contaminated needles, sexually transmitted and rarely infected from mother to fetus.
Hepatitis D is risk of chronic hepatitis B virus and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person from being infected with hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses spread through feweight-oral pathways to drinking water and food, including little heat-treated beef, fish and marine shellfish, donations donor, common-usable needles and infected mother to fetus.
Passengers may be infected with hepatitis E in countries with high levels illness.
The preventive measures of hepatitis include filling hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after taking care of the sick.
Fruit and vegetables wash before consumption, avoid eating little heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and refrain from consuming.
While in the final round the rivals tried to trim the Olympic champion off the track,, the 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won 26.49.51 of the time.
Farah didn't think at length, pulling with her the track husband Tania and children after.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful ', Farah told journalists.
Farah is aiming for the fifth title match in London in a row between 5,000 and 10,000 metres of golden duuble.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connori's "Lady in gold. The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer," dives considerably deeper into the cultural life of one of the works of art in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries in Vienna.
But even more deeply into history.
It would have taken advantage of the awe-inspiring information bracket, a axe of curry, a narrower theme allow the portrait promised in the title to gain more influence in the extraordinary story.
At the, would be there two books between one of the covers: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, Gustav Klimt and her painting "Lady in gold" and the much more extensive and comprehensive history book about of esteemed Jewish families and the German occupation, with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book takes the cultural life Vienna in the midst of, and who himself ended up in the Austrian capital, may imagine how, more than a hundred years ago, life went around Ringstrasse, or how all heads turned in the Central cafe when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and when you see the name familiar with the book, you feel as if you are more cultural grammar.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where there was an incurable syphilis in and Europe had highest level suicide, as if it did not add anything to the development of of the story.
Or perhaps, however, every few words of brush strokes adds colours to the cultural life of the early 20 th century in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19 th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten people in Vienna had a Jew.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice to open up with Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and to Klimt for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh-largest bank in the Habsburgs empire.
But Adelet's entire glamorous life, to which she belonged, was draw.
Looking at "Ladies in gold," it is hard to believe that, towards the end of life, this great lady infected socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his wife from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
's order paid 4,000 kronor at the time, a quarter of the price of a good-placed cottage.
The fact that That, some of the portraits, was suspected a master's love story did not discourage the sugar magnate.
As far as Adelaide is concerned, the only certainty is that the close relationship between the modelli modell and the artist that emerged during the work continued to the end of life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "A lady in gold.
An extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, a portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, "Varrak 2016, an English-translated Aldo Randland.
Just before work began with Adelaide, Klimt had visited Ravennas in San Vitale in basilica, and investigators think that the brilliant mosaics just seen there from the boiling gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adelest as a painted mosaic.
Climt presented his "Ladies in gold" in Vienna in 1908 and around the same time (between 1907 and 1908) another golden painting was born "Siss."
Art historians did not notice the similarity of the two women.
How does Hitler relate to the story?
'I think that remember my friend Klimt, I am to him to make his work available to the public',, wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family's Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had another portrait of Adelest.
Also in her testament (Adele left in February 1925) she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscapes for the Austrian Gallery.
He bequeathed his jewelry to the beavers of Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had graduated from "Austria's Mona Lisa," a 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to get into the Vienna Academy of Beautiful Arts, but failed at a drawing exam.
Although sometimes Hitler's later anti-Semitism is regarded as the reason that having been not accepted into the academy by Jewish professors, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in the Maria testament, had changed considerably by 1939, and it had become important to find the works in Vienna rich Jewish collections of art to the Nazi Party.
of Adele's work at home, but not by of Klimt were also matched by Hitler's personal art charade.
Sixty years after Nazi art works began a ten-year litigation between the Austrian government and the heirs of Bloch-Bauers.
It should only noted at this point that if "Siss" is seen at Belvedere Castle in Vienna, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrayal "Lady in gold" is be seen riding to the Neue Galeries of New York.
And before the Vienna trip read also the aforementioned book.
Even if you go to look at Klimt's works, there is no plan, because at least my emotions revolved more Nazi and Jewish than the painting 135 million and modell around Adele Bloch-Bauer after the book was closed.
So not so much a portrait, but rather a story of - and a very moving story.
The of the Bauers from was noticeably at the beginning of the book facilitated by events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to Estonia's record in Canada
In the, Gold's own 200 m comeback personal record was very close to swimming at 2.16.62.
The top mark dates back to the 17-year-old in the a week ago, when the Canadian junior championship was awarded 2.16.58 by the time, Priit Aaviku is Ujumisblog.
Gold escaped to the the, or tenth, A-finals.
In the finale, he passed a time distance of 2.15.76 and scored a fine seventh place with a new powerful top.
Estonian record for Alina Kendzior (2.15.13) left Goldi subtracted separated in just over half a second.
In Estonia's all-time ranking, Gold rose third, and his fresh personal top mark is the fifth result of all time in Estonia.
The young hope for the future is still taking off in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freeway at the Canadian Adult Championships and in the 200 m and 400 m complex.
The Canadian junior championships were held in Toronto last week, and Gold made successful starters there, too.
He won the 200 m freewheeling silver medal with a time of 2.03.22.
So quickly this distance was floated by the Estonians most recently in 2008.
Estonian record inmate, Elina Partõka, the has swam this distance in Estonia, faster than ever.
The premiership in Canada won the bronze medal in the 100 m freefall with an excellent personal record and the top mark of new Estonian season's 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older, has swam this distance only one hundredth faster.
He reached the top 100 mark 1.03.69 in the opening exchange of the notification period.
At half-long, he only won seventh place when swimming in the finale at 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season rankings at four different distances.
President Trump goes on holiday, critics sharpen teeth
The holiday time is on hand - it also means relaxation for US President Donald Trump.
Since Trump, however, has so far been one of the most holiday days taken out by the president, critics are already sharpening teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president is planning to spend a 17-day holiday at his own golf club in Bedminster, located in New Jersey.
Although the presidential holiday began yesterday, opponents of Trump have already spoken out on the holiday for a week.
They are casting too frequent recreation for Trumpi.
Namely, it is customary for the president to spend weeklong time in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villas.
the Incidentally, Trump has not in his 196 days in office most the president.
For example, George W. Bush reached this time on vacation to be as early as 67 days, with Barack Obama however half less than Trump, in just 21 days.
Trump, though, tends to sleep things quickly.
Recited days after becoming president, Trump said sending "60 minutes" to long holidays his counterpart over time will not stay because very much needs to be done.
He also tweeted outrage about Barack Obama's holiday three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending celebrations and jazz concerts, ISIS journalists are railing their heads from the end."
According to White House officials, a 17-day visit to a golf club is not actually a.
It is officially called a working holiday instead, during which Trumpi does not have time to read or other entertaining activities.
In addition, there was also a second reason for working holidays.
Namely, the conditioning system the West Wing of the White House is exchanged and therefore all staff had to leave it.
The and other presidential premises are also located in the West Wing.
'I don't think any of you would want to be in the West End in August if there's 38 degrees and no air conditioning', said White House spokesperson Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue to work during the holiday.
From where President Trump's 17 days spends, you get a sense of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook < unk > Don't run for state office if you don't tolerate voter criticism
The father of our country knew a lot about the unfavourable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for the newspapers to start him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, upset him.
But he didn't force his critics to remain silent.
Because in 1783, Washington said that, "freedom of speech could be taken away from us and, darkly and silent, we could be led to carnage sheep."
That brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to struggle to be more Washington-like.
Posts at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on official Facebook page have been blocked and deleted by Hogan's subordinates.
And earlier in the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union < unk > ACLU) sued him therefore.
The governor's officialdom temped the lawsuit as and web commentaries were riddled with counter-reactions in the style of "Who's interested?."
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But it does matter.
And that matters especially much when it comes to a man like Hogan.
The act is an astonishingly popular Republican governor in the overwhelmingly Democratic state.
His approval percentage is the among the state's 50 governors.
Hogan is not an unthinking responsive ash head.
It has led the and has remained strictly firmly committed to its principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as a key tool in his dealings with his constituents rather obsessively, for example, by his fiery head after chemotherapy for the first time.
Thus, on the Governor's page < unk >, a public forum with official labels, managed by staff receiving taxpayers' dollars' pay to the visiting people is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Amelia Chasse, a spokeswoman for Hogan, defended the governor's conduct in an interview given to The Washington Post, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating.
But it is too easy to paint a picture of internet trolls, junk institutes or a nation full of hatred.
The Post chatted with several pretty people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that is exactly what they are, quite people who interact with their elected leaders. Teacher, company owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not rotten at all.
his post, The pastor quoted the Bible in oppressing Hogan to Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, The lawyer from maryland Bowie, did not incite hatred but quite about hate crime.
"I commented politely that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in The Post's news story in the commentary room.
'I also don't like the idea that when of people comment on the same subject, some immediately call it an indifferent collective effort, instead of acknowledging that it's a lot of worried citizens.'
What the governor's officialdom called a "targeted junk attack," others would probably call "public support."
The Facebook-era allows messages to be easily matched by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than it was in the past when, in order to do the same, workers had to be expelled to gather newspapers with critical letters and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to remain silent.
But that's exactly what's happening now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media sites toothless.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have blocked him from Twitter stream.
One of the first rulings on the subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the Constitution's first fix when she blocked a voter from her Facebook page.
Kentuckys visited the ACLU over its use of Facebook and Twitter, following also Governor Matt Bevin (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar effect than the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, quadrupled the number of newspapers and anonymous written writers typified his way of governing.
And even then Washington had to contend with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers from pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington decisions to the ground.
According to historical documents collected as part of the online George Washington Letters Project, he buried the cabinet under petitions that criticised his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't force them to remain silent.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
And proper leadership means accepting it.

Former European incumbent Ronan Rafferty is hoping for the comfort of home territory over the next three days when the 25 th Scottish Senior Open takes place at the golf venues of East Lothian Renaissance Club.

It was a very special time that we will always bear in our hearts. '
On homeland soil, Gary Orr, who joined the European culture of the Seniors earlier this year when he became 50, will return to the competition.
It is his first event in Scotland since attending Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Openil in 2013.

I am happy with the way things have gone so far. '
The trio will be joined on the pitch by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and Seniors champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.

Poverty and death in Indonesia's land
When Bardina Degei prepares dinner, she does not use the stove.
He even uses pot rarely.
In a wooden house in Enarotal, the capital of, which is Indonesia's reluctant Papua Province Paniai regency, the housewife puts called nota in local language, directly on the the bath fire level.
After half an hour, the charred comfort will be taken from the fire and filled with unwashed hands eagerly.
Degei sits on the floor of the mud, he has no furniture whatsoever and, at the same time does his daily chores, for example, washing with blurred water from the nearby sex.
The role of the toilet is filled by a bucket rooftop in a room.
As she is the youngest of her husband's four women, she has not been appointed to look after any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous, however, for most of the men village's are unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are still soldiers here.
"No one dares to go around the village after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
It is a rare glimpse into life in the highlands of Papua a former Dutch colony that was merged under Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum that caused controversy, in which only 1026 elderly occupiers were forced to vote by raising their hands before the eyes troops. It
The move, fuelled by the Dutch supremacy, its fury quickly against the Jakarta government, which continues to keep the region under its strong control by deterring foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, so for the independent Papua New Guinea remained east of the island.
In order to reach Siia, you must fly 90 minutes from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabires and then take a five-hour journey with a rental car.
There is no public transport.
A city inhabitants of about 19,000 consists of tree houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by wavy iron roofs, whose rust has turned various shades into yellow-brown.
Very few Indians have taken the journey here, not to mention journalists, nor have there been almost any foreigners here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Mee Pago's boots worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," Degei says, referring to her colourful hand-woven turban, a dark sweater and a private skirt.
'Before that, we only wore vegetable leaves on the body.'
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of Asia's worst.
But it is also an Indonesian gold-rich land.
Just 100 km from Paniai, a mountainous province of about New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants, is the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua can estimated at be USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering suffering the boats, as they necessitate the suffocating presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times showed that Freeport paid about 20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150, 000 to one officer.
The aspirations of the Captain to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden age and are ruthlessly rescheduled.
to human rights activists, More than 500,000 boat children have been killed since 1969, according and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass slaughter the highlands belonging to Papua tribes in the 1970 s was a measure of of genocide.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested by Indonesian police in the area.
Birsbank's 2016 "We'll lose" report includes testimony to atrocities committed in the past year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (report rape and electric shocks are particularly common, according) and the brutal crackdown on peaceful protests.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because incidents like this occur every week," says Andrew Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been shut down even more strongly as Papua's natural resources have caused an influx of newcomers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the crowded islands of Jaava, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi in Indonesia.
The family kitchens of the hunting kids sell gado-gado with cryfish chicken and mixed kitchens, served with peanut sauce.
The locals are unable to compete with them.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market more cheaply than local boots," explains Paniais-born 24-year-old Abeth You, who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, for work.
"Indigenous bangs < unk > paapua mama-mama'd [women] < unk > therefore lose their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known among the nation as Jokowi, pledged in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights abuses in Papua.
The former hip-hop won on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace Papua 29 of 27 constituencies, including Paniai,.
But very little has changed in Papua and the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts have been broken since, in 2014, we voted for Jokowi in the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," You says.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai was languishing in a state.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang Christmas songs in Enarotal a flare when two Indonesian soldiers emerged on a motorcycle from darkness.
The children who told them they should turn the lights on.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers offended on their voting ground and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, drunk soldiers chased the children and beat them with handles of their guns.
One of the soldiers then shot into the children's squad.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, was beaten so cruelly that she fell into a coma.
A few hours later, a nearby Electoral Commission building was set on fire and the next day things escalated further.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered a football pitch in front of a local police station and a military command centre to justice on.
They wore ceremonial hunting chips and presented the whelps-dancing of the Papua honey pago tribe, during which they ran round and the bird's fireworks.
Some protesters began stoning at police and the military.
As the mounted, soldiers were ordered via an internal radio. "If the the crowd points out resistance more than three times, let them down," according to an official document seen by TIME magazine but not issued to local media outlets.
The elder Yeremias Kayame (56), of the enarotal town of Kego Koto district, felt the threatening threat and called for calm to be maintained by, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted had the will to listen.
'Given Turning around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist,' told TIME magazine in his private colours on the wood the.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the gathered soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, a lot of shots in the costume," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to a nephew who watched his shooting.
'I ran to him and examined him through the body to make sure that is him,' Yohanes, who uses only one name as a result of, many indonesmen, told the magazine TIME.
'I saw he was dead... I kissed him.'
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only ensured the security of his district as it was attacked.
"We need to defend ourselves if we are threatened to kill," Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokeswoman for Papua police, said in 2015.
'It's a matter of life and death.'
Five young protesters were killed and many injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
News of the killings only reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, where she offered condolences to the families of the victims and promised to address with the abuses in Papua.
"I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to address crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately, apologies also followed.
'Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990 s and early 2000 s.
The thing is we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes, "he said.
Speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, however, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying that he had no intention of setting up a mechanism in Papua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, "everything will be solved by law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the bloody 1999 independence referendum, said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Papua, including what happened in Paniais.
The families of paniai victims accepted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," Yohanes said.
'I'm tired.'
She says she still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
'I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be fired.'
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Paniai were to dissolve the incident.
He said he received a rope from the military after helping to bury the four victims.
"After burying the dead bodies, the military came to look for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot down villagers in Deiyais, a neighbouring region of Paniai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when it went into a war between villagers and the head of a construction company, who refused to transport an unconscious man to a hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a fish while trying in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's office at the construction site.
According to police, villagers stoned police officers, with the latter responding with warning shots.
But according to locals, the mobile brigade (Indonesian militarized police) began firing at the crowd, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, we are afraid of retaliation," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the the injured get, told TIME magazine.
'I've been hiding in my house for two days.'
Deiyai's parliament has called for the police officers involved to be held accountable and for the police's mobile brigade to be recovered from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is feeding the discontent of the honey, moni, dan and damal tribes living in Papua's landscaping central highlands.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) Taj rebel army, which, according to itself, protects the rights of boat by carrying out random attacks and kidnapping raids among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the VPL's leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of "defending national sovereignty," the army has arrested Paniais and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in recent years.
Some of them never turn again.
Among Papua people, Paniaid is known as a "tragic forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
The lack of rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as elusive.
People grow all their food themselves with mainly bataati, plus a little bit of fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom is able maintain four or five batsefields.
They usually hold most of the harvest for the family, the rest selling in the local market.
Ten bataets cost only 10,000 Indonesian wheat (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality between indigenous boats and new migrants, who have been coming in since the opening of new routes at Nabire Airport, has deepened.
The few jobs that exist go to better-educated and wealthier migrants.
The bad themselves often lack capital or the necessary skills to conduct competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Paniai tribes council.
The separation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, strict are restrictions on foreign media.
French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua earlier this year "they did not follow the relevant practices," although they had been granted a rare film permit.
Phelim Kine, deputy head of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division, said Jokowi's election promises to remove restrictions on reporting practices to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"In Indonesia from Papua's most easterly troubled provinces and journalists trying to report from West Papua are threatened by new threats to EgyptAir visa and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a drilling look at the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations - Taj Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands Bec - were spurred by the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "a wide range of large-scale crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Paniai.
These same countries have historically supported the VPL as well.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's accusations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "There is still democratic order and freedom of the press in place in Indonesia, so would be hard to bury evidence of cases against human rights."
Local people want more foreign governments to take notice.
When the official Dutch delegation, headed by the country's human rights envoy, Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people interrupted their silence, according to a source who wanted to remain anonymous, urging: "We want freedom."
will be new presidential election in Indonesia in 2019, but boots do not believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants to let to that, as well as the people of Paniai constantly living under the threat of a predatory army, they are languishing in misery because of nightly education and health services.
Gobai said the people Paniai, like other boots, consider voice given to his Jokowi to be the debt he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai were able to cope with the latest symbolic insurgency; they buried the body of one of the victims in a police station and the land in in response to the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be done, at least they will prevent those responsible from forgetting their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," Yacobus says with a felled head.
"What else could we do?"
Fire engulfed Dubai's Torch skyscraper for a second time
The fire eaten through one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee this 337-metre high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that has devastated a high-rise building in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch, or the.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct fire was lodged causes.
'We slept and woke up to the fire farm and screaming at people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to subdue from the 50 th floor, "one resident, who called himself George, told Reuters.
According to Dubai Civil Defense officials, firefighters extinguished the flame at about 4 o'clock in the morning local time (00.00 GMT) and chilled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for those affected.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the external surface of high-construction sites around the world.
An investigation by the torch board in the wake of the 2015 fire found that the most damage was suffered by the facial - decorative panels of and insulation the outer surface.
Britain's police have said they believe the insulation and facial panels of London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that took place there in June, in which about 80 people died.
Watch: These phones will probably become sales hitters in the fall
Spring and autumn is a sweet time for tech fans, as then phone makers unveil their new top models.
Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium also came on sale in the spring, with new hitt phones expected for store chains in the autumn.
According to Kristjan Seema, marketing and sales director at Tele2, this year's flagship event will be characterised by innovative design, an eye-speed, an edge-to-edge 4K resolution display and a ultra-fast processor.
The tech world Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the front of the sales table for Estonian smartphones, sparked great excitement in the.
Autumn will allow smart lovers charging even more heavy, a more durable battery, a better quality camera and greater water and dust security.
He added that rumours could already lead assumptions and predict the top four models that are believed to be capturing this year's sales tables.
These top four models of smartphones will still reach the store shelves in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to reach the store shelves as early as mid-September.
The rumours Rumours about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it are spreading a lot.
While the iPhone 7 didn't bring spectacularly large differences next to the iPhone 6 s, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to see the new model differentiate entirely from previous ones.
Four colours have been spoken of: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably screen covering the entire front panel of the phone, a home button has been lost and a fingerprint reader is built inside the screen.
Apple's design manager JonyIve insists the new iPhones model looks like a smooth glass.
There has also been talk of a ceramic version of iPhones.
faster A11 processors can be expected, in addition to an eye-speed shutter, wiring-free charging and a more high-quality camera.
It's certainly one of the year's most anticipated smartphones.
Pre-order of the brand new model Galaxy Note 8 starts on August 23.
Many rumours have been leaked about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It has reportedly been designed even more for the business user and S Pen is allowing even bigger functionalities.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which is a wave and the other a TV lens with a narrower field of view.
For now, no one knows what the two rear-view cameras are capable of, but in any case, this it will be Samsung's first test, certainly comparable to the iPhone 8 in terms of quality.
However, we are looking forward to 23 August.
While Nokia has brought three smartphones to the sale this year, headed by Nokia 6, their flagship store - Nokia 8, which is already being on August 16 - is still missing.
We expect a display from Nokia to 5.3-inch remote and ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors and a more resilient battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of aluminium corps and a significant degree of water and dust security in IP68.
Like Samsung, the Nokia new model of has two rear-view cameras, with optics produced by company Zeiss.
While Sony's solid flagship has been the XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We look forward to a smartphone that is slightly more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least as good or better with a camera.
There has been speculation about Sony's new model that its display will be at least six-month-old.
What reality brings, we can see very soon, because traditionally Sony has unveiled its Autumn flagship at the IFA International Technology Fair, which this year runs from 1 to 6 September.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico over paying for border wall
The Washington Post disclosed transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican leaders and Australian state.
On January 27, Trump went on a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to end stop the public that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president cracked with him for publicly condemning the wall, tweeting, "You're not allowed to say to the press."
Trump erected his presidential campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts were also published from his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal under which the United States would take on refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous," "chewy" and "stupid." He argued that the deal, made during the Obama administration, would leave him with a "guide card" impression as he has proposed a ban on resettling refugees into the United States.
Trump ended the speech by announcing to Turnbull that "it was the most egregious speech of the day."

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, according to officials.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the city's Qarabagh division.
That bombing is the latest in a series of acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people died in the Herat mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people in Kabul near the Iraqi embassy.
A NATO statement said the four-day explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with "a man-borne self-made explosive."

According to correspondents, the growing force of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), in Qarabagh is a serious source of concern for the forces in NATO's Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20 percent of them in the capital.

EPA annulled decision to delay tax rate after lawsuits
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (United States States Environmental Protection Agency < unk > EPA) overturned decision to delay the introduction of an Obama-era regulation obliges states to limit smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency because of its move.
The EPA announced the decision to continue "with the 2015 ozone assignment procedures" late on Wednesday, saying it shows the agency's commitment to working with the states.
"We believe we need to engage in dialogue with partners from our state and to listen to them," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to postpone its ozone for the, which will measure tax pollution in different parts of the country to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 to meet the tougher air quality standard.
15 mostly Democratic states filed a hag with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, saying that the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to pull back a series of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama., according to Trump, it is part of a more comprehensive plan to boost growth.
But those efforts have sparked reactions among Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the impact of increased pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that air inhalation containing ozone "can reduce the ability of the lungs to work and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases," such as asthma.
German pigs can come to a feast.
German pigs and cattle may come to a feast as heavy rains threaten the prey of the European Union's second-largest wheat producer, Bloomberg writes.
This year, it may be the case that weeks of sausage before the harvest may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry only serves to feed the animals.
"The quality of wheat is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
Up to 40 per cent of German wheat could go for animal feed this year, which is double compared to normal, the Finnavis predicted.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all weather this year.
In the first place, winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, replaced by a heatwave in June.
In July, Germany was hit by the, which have also continued in August.
Many eyes are turned on northern Germany, where rain prevents harvest.
So far, only five per cent of wheat has been cleared.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are expected to be on a collision course to go face in the most coughing boxing match of the near future, up to 66.7 kg in weight category, met for the the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN's office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeatable World Boxing Council light-weigh lightweight champion, walked to the other end of the corridor to greet Lomachenkot,, the closing champion of the World Boxing Organizations.
After Garcia's unanimous decision led to a victory over former quadruple world champion Adrien Broner at Showdown on Saturday, both fighters are among the top five on the weight table.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said: "How do you go, champion?
I wish you success. '
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 19 ESPN.
While the pair poked for the photos, Lomachenko's mountain Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between the militants would be a "perfect measurement."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
'I moved up to [63.5 kg] for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small at 63.5 kg.
I want to move downward to lightweight.
And he must move upwards of the lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fans have liked it.
Let's offer them that then. '
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid to watch it. It is part of his strategy that he wants to let Lomachenko debut in the 61.2 kg class later this year to make a possible meeting next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 arcs), who also has an interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbell's match after their September 23 lightweight title game Forumil.
"It could be rewarding to watch this fight as the fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said, later saying he was open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
'We're the key players.
No other name can attract so much attention.
Whenever they're ready... '
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a "mighty fighter" and could go watch his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was subdued in praising Garcia, saying that in his mind the three divisions champion of from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry,, Mikey... you wanted that darker."
According to Garcia, the goal was to show shock strength and then boxing.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension was growing to flourish between them.
'It's a fight waiting to be realised.
No other confrontation produces so much attention and buzz.
I'm more than willing to work on that, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: 'I've been on hold for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It's going to be a good fight. '
Which parts of the world will be moved to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Protection Agency (PPA) extended and issued a record number of over 13,000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia for work, study or family.
example If, for, last year, a fixed-term residence permit was decided to be to 6702 foreigners, the figure was 4928.
The authorities cannot say how many migrants will eventually remain in Estonia permanently, but such an analysis will be prepared in in the Ministry of the Interior.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ten years ago, in recent years this figure is close to 2 000.
The number of applicants for residence permits soared during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014, 1087 people obtained a fixed-term residence permit up from 675 a year earlier.
According to the statistics, the number of Ukrainian citizens is the largest in Estonia, with 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia last year more than left.
"The Ukrainian community has been great in Estonia all the time, and due to the difficult circumstances in the country it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many also family are already ahead," said Kristin Rammus, a spokeswoman for the the Interior Ministry.
Last year and a time, the number of Ukrainians receiving a fixed-term residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, even though in ten years, the most fixed-term residence permits were issued to the latter.
If the Ukrainians come here to work predominantly, then Russian citizens for family migration.
"Given the historic Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the biggest family ties to people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, a migration researcher at the Homeland Defense Academy.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have obtained a residence permit in Estonia have moved to, after Harjumaa there is East Virumaa," he added, and pointed out that about 40 per cent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received a fixed-term residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit decreased.
"The leap is due to the fact that, instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been requested permanently to Estonia," explained Rammus, a spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry, who said that the interest of Russian citizens' in Estonia's residence permit has remained stable for years.
who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit to enter Estonia permanently from the previous year.
Its aim is to encourage the of people who have adapted.
However, a long-term resident's residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has also apparently decreased because of the new residence permit.
For example, last year, this residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians can switch jobs, and the Estonian state is no longer pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit became popular - applicants last year were holders of grey passport (1029), the Russians (487), the Indians (54) and the Nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 people received a residence permit for to Estonia, including, for example, 23 official tacos, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and just as many Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly, become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for the Estonian residence permit.
When three residence permits were issued to the in 2007, 200 were issued last year.
From Nigeria, they come to these universities to study.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of Indian, Bangladeshi and Nigerian citizens has risen largely thanks to learning migration.
For them, too, the rule that where the community has arisen, there is others more easily, "Rammus added.
In ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from, for example, North Korea, just as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6,000 third-country nationals get a residence permit per year, that's about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if we consider the citizens of the European Union, migration remains around a percentage, "Maasing commented that, the numbers are in fact, small.
According to the statistics office, 14 822 people travelled to Estonia last year, compared 13 792.
That means immigration exceeded the second year of emigration.
The majority of those who and enter are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among those who leave.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was less than 2 000 people last year.
Estonians migrate primarily between Finland and Estonia.
The printing code of Mlong Couturee captures satas, ticks and thylights
The bottomless time of ideas, however, is history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours somewhere in a museum and admire old sleeves and collars.
If you do something with passion then you study and learn about it every day.
It is a joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mlong Couturee may seem life-like to some, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much brilliance your life has!
I have a girlfriend who has a whole sauna full of haute couturee dresses I created.
Because it is not fault that she does not live in Hollywood and does not walk on the red carpet every day, wants to wear these most beautiful dresses and heels!
You get yourself to live your life special!
The fashion designer does not recognise the gap between glittering events and grey day-to-day.
It was this reasoning that set the plan to high fashion in Estonia to rural areas, between forests and fields, to people who are often not reached by fashion.
The mlong collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvis and Pärnu, where a royal defilee with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, posture is often in, nodded with dignity, but there there are more emotions elsewhere - cries braavo, stand up, wants to thank you in hand.
Much of the audience came to be equally newsworthy, but now they are the fans of Mlong Couturee.
When you exceed people's expectations, they are enthused!
And I like the feeling that I am on a summer course with my fashion.
We had a 50-metre red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, it seemed they were not coming to an end!
Maria also doesn't recognize the fashion plan that the creations must be presented by a supersal supermodell, her willingly bringing ordinary women onto the stage.
I often invite my own customers the stage - they have always come with joy.
all, 's such a grim experience, you can shine on stage in a wonderful dress!
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen my, I am always behind the stage to give things the last flesh as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve would not be allowed to sit on the floor calmly.
Maria is a fashion designer of this kind, who not only wanting to play a representative role, but also to be inside everything hand.
I have a studio with my seam machine, most of the collection I perform for myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, you discover.
I am never far from my creation and I am not afraid of the work.
The design thing is not limited, stylistics, logistics, organisation, organisation - everything has to fit one temperamental woman's day off.
These working hours are still coming from fanatics enormously.
I can't tell when my working day will end, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an incessant chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, man gets something beautiful and still in turn compliments.
It has been said many times that there is magic in my dresses - they make themselves feel like a princess.
The abundant that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained a the signatory of Mlong Couture to this day.
Martin Entertainment U18 boys: The gun of the Estonians' subgroup was now turned against us
Sorry, the fairy tale ran out.
The first thing was that we did not get our hands on the table.
And when there is such a big difference in the table, there is nothing to do, "commented U18 basketball boys 61: 75 loss to Britain by the our only basketball player in the NBAs, BBC Kalev/Cramo aid coach Martin Mortgage.
Opponents took 28 balls from the attacking table and got so many more attacks because of it.
We were also not prepared for their aggressive defence or attack, it created.
Many attacks by Englishmen ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build up protection.
In defence, however, they were able to hold their hands in between, we could not combine.
It created the team with from the bottom its legs.
The opponents homework of the was better done.
According to the trademark, Estonia should have made more tactical errors in order to take down the momentum of its opponents in the bud.
In the last quarter - we had zero errors, but opponents already got several quick baskets.
Athleticism and tight insistence, which was at the subgroup our weapon, now all turned against us.
Today we had no strength against their aggressiveness.
The wall was left in peace with his care in Kalev, Matthias Tassiga.
In the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team, and until now there was a common sense of shock.
It is a pity that such an aggressive opponent had not been met before.
The cup has been confident all along and played her off today but it looked like she was tired - she has been carrying a pretty big burden.
But he made some pretty nice moves that I have seen in the trolls before ', the supervisor added.
Terrible numbers: The maiden basketball team threw less than 10 points at the EM-tournament with three quarters...
is not only does basketball tournament the young men's EM B Division in Tallinn, to age class the girls started the day before yesterday in Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland, unfortunately, tended to be the realm of antiquities.
Estonia lost 25: 65, but still after the third quarter of the year, it was 9: 49, in the last ten minutes, opponents took their foot from the gas pedal, and the period remained as late as 16: 16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia threw 4, third with 1 points...
At the beginning the, they hit two pieces from the first four in two minutes, and then 25 pieces from the game, then one three in and then another 21 along...
Perhaps in almost half an hour, one of the 47 was caught.
In addition, 2 points came from four open risks.
There were a reasonable number of requests for with that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had visual coverage 33 and Estonia had 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, and Portugal 83: 56 rewards had to admit on the opening day.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to supplement stocks
Today, NATO's 1 st permanent mine group arrived in Tallinn for a weekend at a planned port visit to replenish the stock of ships and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships prepare to return to the sea and give crew members the opportunity for a pariday holiday.
After the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and be ready for future operations to search for historical explosive devices.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the interoperability training they carry out in local waters illustrates our integration with the allied forces," said Arto Reinmaa, chief of the Operation and Planning Division, is the Naval Fleet Commander commander.
Since 29 June, NATO will lead the 1 st permanent anti-mine group, Latvian naval captain Gvido Laudups, who took over the tasks of the group leader during a ceremony in Riga from the the Estonian naval officer Johan-Elias Seljamaa.
The flagship the group's is been the Latvian naval support vessel, LVNS Virsaitis, which also operates the group's flagship headquarters.
This semester, the Estonian naval mine maker Sakala will also be part of the international unit.
As one of four groups of ships under the NATO Maritime Command, NATO's 1 st Standing Mine Group is a preparedness unit the primary rapid response, which the alliance can send to various parts of the world within five days.
Between 4 and 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, launched 13 years ago by the Maestro Eri Kid, is being held.
This year's Birgitta Festival, according to Risto Joosti (36), the artistic leader of the Tallinn Philharmonic, will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: Listeners end up in the classics of the opera world include "Traviata" and "Tosca," ballet discoveries from the captivating "Bolero" to the amusing "Karlssonin" and also missing a plan for own production, this time Joseph Haydn's wonderful Oratorium "The" was laundered by the same international creative team that in 2015 brought the masterpiece the stage.
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre discoveries.
It's bigger than any musical theatre in its usual form.
This is a festival whose snow takes hold and never quite lets loose again.
Because the experience that the listener has in this sublime and mysterious environment makes human souls ring and touches human perceptions in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic leader of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't the shoes of maestro Eri Kid look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klasi, it has helped a lot.
He directed me through the whole my student career and also supported the beginning of a conduction career.
Perhaps it is thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue his work.
Various Klas have injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it all spills over to me as well.
It was great to join a team that knows how things are going exactly.
It was the great heart of Eri that gave me the strength to make good progress with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn.
And here I am now and I can cope!
What could an you audiences at this year's festival, what special are offering?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, by the way, the first ballet written on Astrid Lindgren's narrative comes to the presentation.
The order is "Karlsson flies."
And one curious nuance of this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed his desire to write this work.
Apparently he has lived already has Karlsson's carakter who in his soul since his child.
Risto, how do you yell it all?
Thanks to my supporting life partner, I am sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I am happy to have a pile.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend as much on other people as on myself, in other words, how I am going to every new day.
And such conscious toning, holding on to positivity, and actually laughing to yourself in the morning mirror, greatly boosted my fortune.
Especially now this week, when there are the most important rehearsals, I have particularly excitedly to practise it and it works.
Smiling yourself activates the brain and lifts the tone.
That is not just a buzzword.
I think that people do not know half of the things about their body that the universe offers them, but each one will slowly discover it.
Right now, it is an important moment.
Do you also have a ritual before taking the conductor's pulse?
It is still, clothes need to be switched for more convenient ones.
It's that little moment for yourself.
But, in general, yes, I have no chance of rest or a little lull before I have making a big appearance.
In fact, I even like to engage actively with people, even before entering a conductor.
But come all to the Birgitta Festival, here's what to discover, too, not a particularly great friend of opera and ballet!
Watch the mighty video with Risto Joosti!
New results of age assessment tests for Swedish asylum applicants
The most recent results of the test show that more than 80 per cent of were rated older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
Sweden's National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started the tests earlier this year.
The tests were set up to assess the age more accurately during an application for asylum after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of several supposedly underage refugees.
To date, 6880 cases have been sent testing Migrationsverket, and the Institute for Judicial Medicine has issued a total of 2,481 test results between mid-March 2017 and July 31.
Eighty per cent (2002) was rated as 18-years-old or older, and in another 25 cases, the Institute of Judicial Medicine estimated that the test "may be 18-years-old or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person is "probably younger than 18."
Tests are only used when a person's age is in question.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent compared those of the previous months.
"We don't see a big difference in terms of statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local newspaper.
That much of the cases were rated older than 18 doesn't necessarily mean asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The institute issued 581 test results in May and said there are "indications in 442 cases that the person being examined is 18 years old or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet the results of those 581 tests, it emerged that in 243 cases, the person had directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, whereby X-ray images of delivery teeth and MRT are performed then allowed to be analysed by dentists and radiologists,, has been criticised in some quarters.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose duties include assessing people's biological maturity to find out if they passed puberty sooner or later than normal.
'I've had reason to think about it and I don't think the measurement method currently used should be used.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, then we shouldn't make the face that we can, "he told Metro newspaper.
But Johan Göransson of the Institute of Judicial Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "Overall, it can be said that the risk of a child being into adulthood is low.
the highest, or about 10%, the The risk is in case a person is a little under 18. '

West Virgina governor announced party swap
West Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would swap the party.
"Like it or not, but Democrats walked away from me," Governor Justice said.
'Today I'm telling you, having prayed and thought for... today I'm telling you, the West Enginians, that I can't help you any more as a democratic governor.'
celebrations of joy were conquered At the gathering,.
"So I will be a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
'As a coach, I would tell you it's time to play another game.'
Trump had promised a major announcement earlier at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the state's only billionaire, turned out to be elected in 2016, according to Forbs.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and the coal business inherited him from his father.
Its value is about 1.59 billion dollars.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) released an announcement Thursday night that "the party swap of Governor Justice is another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather prevent the country from getting better again than working it."
"With just 15 governors and control over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent cancellation for a party that is the end and is unable find a positive and unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to to CBS News.

Coe praised Russians' honest apology for doping scandal
Athletics international ninamman Sebastian Coe praised, according to his words, "Russia's Thursday honest apology" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country back into sport.
Russian athletics darker Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF congress on the eve of the athletics World Cup that the his country match ban imposed on was right and has firm target to fight doping.
He apologised to "all light enforcement officers who have been snapped away by gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to withhold a match ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF president Coe told journalists.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian subunion itself admitted that they had had quite difficult times and were doing everything they could to restructure the subunion."
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for.
"I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the group's proposal that this is not the time to withdraw Russia," Coe said.
'We've got to do everything we can over the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the spoiled system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian light who meet the IAAF's strict criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the athletics World Championships starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the iaafs group, said on Monday that Russia was not yet meeting several criteria for reinstatement.
After a presentation to the IAAF council, he told journalists in London that doping control was still insufficient and coaches who been banned were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution is make significant difference to the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
Not only does the electric car revolution substantially fundamentally change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say they will win from one place and lose from the other, smaller mining firms will not help.
now, Glencore serves from coal and oil, but in the future age of electric cars, cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel demand for will increase.
This year, decisions by by the governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway, which allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to to be banned in the coming decades have been raised the stakes on the spread of electric cars.
already made Volvo Sestap has they plan to scrap the internal combustion engine, and Tesla will bring a cheaper Model 3 electric car to the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts more electric cars will be sold two decades than cars using oil-produced fuels.
"In terms of some metals, it changes everything," Simona Gambranini, raw materials analyst at Capital Economics, told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, which has been growing for the demand for years.
Electric cars have about three times more copper than conventional cars, reported Glencore.
More copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribasi estimates it will increase copper demand by about five per cent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore is benefiting from a growing electric car trend from rising copper prices and being the world's largest coconut producer, the predicted Jefferies Group.
This county company estimates that the other winners electric car race will be Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
Cobalt has increased by 70 per cent this year on London's metal exchange.
The bubble price increase was 37 per cent.
Copper has also increased by 14 per cent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's share rose 20 per cent in London, having surpassed rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo Americani in price rises.
On the losers' side, lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine will have to adjust to a new era.
The main end-use of the lead is the batteries supplying starters with from and diesel engines.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless other purpose is found for it, to overcome a drop in demand" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch metal market analysis manager Michael Widmer.
The lead in the price movement has not yet seen the impact of the loose trend.
Lead has plunged 17 per cent this year, with it the best metal from price hike among key industrial metals in London.
Investors seeing problems with the metal only in the far future.
"I'm not sure it's so bad for the lead because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars in competition" said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at metal broker firm Triland Metals.
If the lead demand for falls, it will happen slowly.
It may be the case in about a decade.
In the meantime, tougher exhaust standards mean that demand for hybrid cars, which rely on advanced lead-based batteries for frequent engine launches, will be assessed by the international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel as the lighter car can drive further with less electricity.
An additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium demand is explained by between 2013 and 2016.
It accounts for 2.7 per cent of the total world production of aluminium.
That trend is likely to deepen, Widmer said.
Aluminium has jumped 13 per cent this year as rising demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel manufacturers not sleeping.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce miraculous car.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to withstand the aluminum humum.
"Ultra-strong steel should be the answer to this development," said Exane BNP Paribasi analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to the platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal was worn as catalysts for cars, reported metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"Many of the raw materials currently high-demand high demand such as oil and platinum may not have high demand in the future," Natixis commodity analyst Bernard Dahdah said.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
Plate manufacturers believe continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore chief Marc Grynberg said more hybrid cars would continue to be sold from electric cars in 2025.
The big high hopes for platinum manufacturers in the 10-year term are the hydrogen cell-based cars developed by the Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos, which rely on platinum to generate electricity from hydrogen.
So far, however, this technology has not yet commercially justified itself.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars," said Exane from BNP Paribas, Brunet.
German car manufacturers suffered a major setback in July as a Stuttgart court banned diesel in the hometown of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football's finance rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules designed to prevent rampant spending of European football clubs will not prevent Neymar's world-record move from from Spanish football club Barcelona to France club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that dominates the European game and which has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, Paris Saint-Germain is yet to come.
The Financial Rules of Fair Play (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar's transfer was funded without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid €222 million (262 million) for buying Brazilians out of his contract alone, and Neymar's salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's transfer to the French club.
Psg will no doubt be able to come up such money to recruit Neymar and add to its alphabet ranks, given that the team is funded by the ruling family from Qatar's energy competition.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to get out with their own in the football business.
Ffp-le laid the groundwork for Michel Platini after being elected president of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs falling debt in search of success were actually engaging in cheating and risking ruin should banks or owners give up support.
Since 2011, the FFP will focus on tracking their losses rather than of on clubs' debts.
That change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then making big spending to improve the team and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
Ffp's current three-year assessment period, which runs until 2018, could see losses of up to €30 m clubs suffer.
And despite Platini being shamefully ousted from the presidential office in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The ffp is definitely not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," Andrea Traverso, the overseer of the FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid for Neymar's over-purchase clause as a single full levers, they will be able to split that amount for accounting purposes throughout the period of validity of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, making it possible to show the transitional fee over the next five years as a sum of €44.4 million years.
Ffp on the first wave of sanctions in 2014, PSG, with Manchester City belonging to Abu Dhabi, received the worst penalties by.
Psg was fined 60 million euros (82 million at that point), reduced later to 20 million euros, and the club were ordered to limit the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs who may try to shovel over regulators' financial institutions by blowing up their incomes through companies linked to club owners.
The Qatar company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is deemed to be above standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income.
This was in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the case Qatar Tourism Authority PSG support from was upbeat.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymar's PSG service could come through payments from Qatar the 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become an ambassador for the World Cup and argue that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a manoeuvre.
penalties handed to psg mean UEFA will be even more vigilant in relation to any attempts to flout the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed Neymar's transition proactively with PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed as they are not allowed to discuss PSG's situation.
The most recent reports show that PSG made more than €10 million in profits at a turnover of around €542.4 million euros the 2015-2016 season.
Data from the latest financial year have not yet been published.
Psg hopes Neymar's arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship deals, commercialisation and.
The club expects a turnover increase of at least 30 per cent signing the contract.
the The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, Neymar's tried to block the switch by claiming PSG would be breach the FFP with it.
"This is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the country," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, citing that PSG being mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal mountaineer Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by United's sports guarantee, shares the La Liga stance that the country is funding the club.
"This is a consequence of ownership and it has completely changed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
'If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the country may have other ways or other interests to make represent the country such a great player. '

Today 50 years ago: A storm in Estonia that tore roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which raged on 6 and 7 August, caused severe damage, particularly to the Baltic, Harjumaa and Raplamaa.
In northwest Estonia, during these days wind speeds were over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one tree to another in the garden and tried with his hands to support them.
Everything was blind and ragged, like the end of the world.
Roofs were already flying from the houses on the road, in 2002 the Mrs Linda Kurova recalled in an interview given to Haapsalu in Nature.
Linda's husband saw his own planted garden collapse.
But what do you still support the trees with your hands, where do you get against such a storm?
The sea came down the window, water sprayed from the windows, "said Mrs Linda, who lived in Haapsalu on the shore at the time.
That the roads were filled with trees and the roof of the railway station's perron had flown 20 to 30 metres away, Linda saw most of the shark saluls similarly as recently as the next morning.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were logical on the ground, some completely lying, some half.
looked very depressing, the storm walked through the beautiful old trees with a rack and crack like a war.
Virumaa was not particularly badly affected in August 1967 compared to Western Estonia, but the losses were high, the Journal Virumaa wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Lossipark and Padise Park were swept from the ground, but parks our wearing were also badly damaged.
In Tallinn, wind speeds were measured up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometres per hour.
on the evening of 6 August, In Tallinn, there was one small piece of plaque shouting: 'Mother, Mom!
The chickens are in the air and can no longer be signed! "," wrote the Virumaa Journal.
The building of the manor in the cultivation was destroyed during the storm that it was later decided to be demolished.
The Türi ski jump constructions, which were no longer restored, did not meet the August storm.
The Red Star wrote on August 12, 1967, that harvesting of towns and settlements from buried trees and their branches is progressing slowly, and residents could participate in the harvesting work.
Fruit fields were also badly affected in the storm, and the newspaper reported that "party algorials need to be both reorganisation and in fertility and directing stations."
Hurricanes can be talked about when average wind speeds exceed 32.7 m/s.
The record of restless wind in Estonia remains as 2, November 1969, when Ruhnul measured wind speeds of 48 m/s.
Vaindloo was broken by a meter, so the speed of strong winds measured there could not be accurately recorded.
Secret of clean bathing areas: night cleaning and poor beach weather
Colder summer weather also means less harvesting in Tallinn bathing areas.
'If there is a weather, people are on the beach, and if there are no, there are no people', says the beach cleaner.
Echo on the beach in Stroom in Tallinn.
They are offered a melodic competition by a tractor burning at low turns, which ploughs down the stripe on the plate.
In fact, the latter sifts through the sand a depth of seven centimetres, picking out marine litter and the risk left behind by humans: bottlenecks, cigarette and more.
People still come to the beach, regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If there is beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if not, there are no people, "says Alexander Usov, head of the Haabersti Administration beach cleaning works at the Private Company.
At 6.30 am and the beach is undergoing a bitter cleaning job because at eight the plats must be fine for people.
Usov has already clocked four o'clock the working post.
Apart from Stroom, he keeps an eye on the beach of Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pikakari.
Rubbish collections have declined.
Years ago, there was much more of it.
People can now already appreciate what is being done for them, "says Usov, who has harvested the beaches for 15 years.
was the case that, when something new was put up, it was already broken the next day.
Now it's already being kept what the beach is.
The price of a clean beach
One of the biggest works on Estonian beaches is the harvesting of the sea, the adru.
For example, on Pirita beach, this coastal season has to be transported by 400 000 tonnes.
"It's an incredible amount," notes Usov.
The second big category is municipal rubbish, all that people leave behind.
The half-kilometre Stroom beach bar has eight large waste containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
So much occurs rubbish.
However, colder summer weather has meant that rubbish is a fifth less than it otherwise is.
The third species is made up of abandoned things.
These are mostly children's lives.
this time, Usov has shovelled a dozen model cars have been the sand.
They will wait for the owners on the wooden road leading to the beach.
"They usually come out more, but it's a normal harvest." Usov already knows that soon he will find them again in the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to sink them in the sand again.
Rubbish is scattered
Haabersti Administrative Services spokesman Erika Scholler admits that locals are by the tractor's screening work.
The noise, which runs from night hours to early morning, blends the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
On the day, however, this work is impossible.
In one month, the beach must be screened twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us, Scholler notes.
the aim However, like the same Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu, is to get Stroom beach under the hallmark of the international blue flag.
"There is much more work in Estonia than in Europe to be the beaches cared for," Scholler says.
We have more adru and stones and it harder to sift sand.
But there is less rubbish on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
To hear the beach talk about rubbish, Martin, who lives near Stroom Beach, steps into an unforced conversation round between a journalist and harvesting staff, highlighting the beach's current bottlenecks.
In the morning, there is a balcony picture everywhere.
The problem is with birds and bottle-slaves who have pulled the bags of rubbish ', reports Martin.
While it is hard to expect people to be able to change their current behavioural behaviour, Martin hopes the town hall will do something about the bins and put a lid on them, for example, to prevent at least birds from there underway.
Overall, however, Martin is happy with the development of Stroom beach.
It can be seen that the city takes care of it.
has become more pleasant children's trails, enlightened and freshly populated roads, it.
It was once the case that the rollercoaster was only able to ride one way, "notes Martin.
Aardino finds in: coins, only coins
40-year-old Dimitri, a who combs a coaster with a metal detector,, has had to to morning be exploited From morning.
He does not believe that he will find anything precious today or in the future.
Marine gods are not generous enough to do so.
'I've been dealing with it for a year and haven't found anything valuable so far', reports Dmitry.
As a hobbard hunter, in Dmitry's treasure bag, there are some euro coins, bottlenecks and also dangerous pounds that will later be thrown in the bin.
Usually there are still coins.
'gold, rings and so on are not usually', says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at former level as lacklustre growth and the easing of inflation have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as households' incomes have put interest rates on hold.
Policymakers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep 6: 2 rates at 0.25% and fewer members are calling for a rise this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank trimmed its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 per cent and 2018 to its 1.6 per cent and warned that pressure on household incomes would remain as inflation is still expected to rise near 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank also signaled that rates rates be necessary to curb inflation caused by over the the next few years and that a higher rise in borrowing costs could need be in financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of a partial withdrawal of the mammoth package to boost the economy which was launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
The bank will end a fixed-term funding scheme in February offers cheap funding to banks, although said it now expects a £15 bn increase in offers under the scheme, which is £115 bn.
In minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future, as the plight of real household incomes continues to have an impact on consumption."
On rates, it was reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" was needed to ease inflation, and this was "somewhat higher" than expected in the markets.
The stock exchange is currently predicting a first rise in the third quarter of next year and a second rise in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any jumps are step-by-step and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to May's forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for 2018's 1.8 per cent increase remained.
After that news, the pound's rate fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make any changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened growing hopes of a rise in GDP 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
The bank says growth is likely to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it is starting to gather some momentum at the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave households suffering from rising inflation and a paltry pay rise little reason to cheer on, saying the situation was going a bit worse before they.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent a hit on earnings in the next few years, but a marked recovery in wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The weak pound also spurs the economy by growing demand for British produce, partly offsetting lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were moved to 0.25 per cent last August following a shocking EU referendum that caused the pound to suddenly weaken.
The bank estimates it will probably take four years to breathe full life into prices and the economy.
Ahead of the Bank's latest decision, there was a growing demand for a rate hike as inflation had increased pressure on hard-pressed households; in July, three policymakers called for a rate hike of 0.5 per cent.
Inflation fell to 2.6 per cent last month, down 2.9 per cent in June, although the bank said it was expected and is expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess increase compared to the 2-per-cent target was due to a completely weak pound.
Coreco's head of mortgage brokers Andrew Montlake said: 'Given the recent fall in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is once again becoming increasingly competitive as lenders crave work and hope to finish the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end, as refinancing, often without charge and at low rates, has become increasingly popular. "
NHS is prescribing 10,000 people for controversial HIV medication
Patients have access to "transformative" HIV preventive treatment since September after a battle in the High Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England reported that National Healthcare is now making available to an estimated 10,000 people during the initial three-year clinical trial for pre-exposure prophylactics (PrEP) - a tablet administered before the intercourse, which has shown a reduction in the risk of infection in high-risk people by around 86 per cent.
The NHS agreed to fund a clinical trial after upheld last year's ruling the High Court Court of Appeal that the NHS able to pay for PrEP, despite the authority's own claims that the the drug should instead be funded by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, hailed the move unveiled on Thursday as a "new sweeping intervention," while the National Assistance Fund (NAT) described it as a "watershed moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start registering people. will be added further clinics in October before the programme is rolled out across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylactics (PrEP) is a of HIV drugs that are taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
of trials show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people with a risk of infection.
Taking prep before intercourse means there are sufficient amounts of certain drugs in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the intercourse.
Candidates suitable for treatment include LGBT or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV infected and do not receive treatment.
Clinics identify suitable people who agree to take part in a clinical trial, including men, women, trans-gender people and those whose HIV partner does not receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their participation at the local sexual health clinic taking part in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 m and NHS England signed a contract to get drugs this week after an international procurement procedure.
The clinical trial designed to assess PrEP real potential of by gathering clinical evidence of who the the drug is is intended for and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture.
Stevens said: 'This new extensive intervention should complement and amplify the wide-ranging and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of struggle with one of the greatest health problems humanity. "
Deborah Gold, chief executive of NAT, said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
Prep, if properly targeted at those in need and belonging to a risk group, offers the chance to change England's HIV epidemic.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England through this NHS-funded clinical trial, have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on negotiations with a partner,, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, chief executive of the terrence Higgins Foundation, said: 'It is now a priority to ensure that the clinical trial across the country is swiftly off and that no one of HIV remain is left behind.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been procured, we are on the way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.
Sharon Hodgson, shadow public health minister, said: 'The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and well overdue after months of delays and dragging the government's feet.
Evidence shows how much change this drug can bring to HIV prevention work and ending the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us a step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is introduced across the country as soon as possible to protect people who have exposure to HIV and take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society. "
The price of electricity rose by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania it fell.
In July, the difference in the next day's stock price electricity between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to €1.94, compared with €7.71 in June this year, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia, the average exchange price for electricity was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour last month, and the price increased by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17, and the system price of the electricity exchange Nord Pool was at the same time EUR 26.37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and seven per cent respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland electricity 75% of the hours of the previous month moved Estonia and 16% of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of hours between the two countries did not carry out the next day's deals.
Electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved 99% of the time from Estonia to Latvia, and 73% of the hours used the full transmission capacity.
On the Nasdaq OMX market on the last trading day of July, the electricity exchange price in August could be about 34 and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the cost of generating electricity rose last month, and the transactions took place at a price between 5.04 and 5.47 per tonne.
Living a high life - half-floor and smart design chips have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spatial home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator, swapped her large Knightsbridge home in 2014 against the Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and that Joanne has not wrapped her bags together and sold the apartment further, is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my former life partner in Knightsbridge on a much bigger surface," Joanne said.
'I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I was offering.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and had similar high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day. '
Since its first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a full factor.
At first it was a one-bedroom and sophisticated layout flat - to reach the bedroom it had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a half-floor to take advantage of high ceilings.
'I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
Those were my demands, "he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from architectural and design studio Duck & Shed in Notting Hill to take advantage of 3.8 m-high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development site, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a half-floor where one could stand up.
Erfan had to approach the matter creatively.
"The metal design is quite complex," he explains.
'We had to reorganize the premises so they would be stationed on top of each other without having to bend.
It wasn't just about building a platform, but we used a steel design to get the height of both the upper and bottom space right. '
This position allowed Erfani to create two full-height rooms in the room with plenty of dramatic elements.
The semi-floor opens with an old-time left-light Retrouvius window a view the glamorous living room under the view.
The golden furniture, silver detailing and retrospective Serge Mouille's luminaire accentuate the style of the space.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatrical, perimeter and light saturation.
Mirrors have been added to both ends of the short corridor to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the back-up with a mirror gives the impression of the window opening to another room.
At the entrance, the mirror capsule offers a deposit for all of Joanne's dining and glass requirements.
The living room adds charm to the possibility of closing the kitchen section if not used, creating an image of a more glamorous space.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, there a unique fact in this kitchen is that it is a garage-type revolving door.
"There was a bit of design effort going into it," Erfan explains the door of the spooned MDF, which was with steel strength.
'It has a counterweight, which is why it glides very easily when it's put up.'
smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra meters, an extra bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"After all, the floor space is what you sell - or what gives the property value," Erfan says.
'The real estate agent steps into the outdated form of room and makes calculations based on the area of the floor.'
Here they have been able to increase floor space, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"Materials are the ones you're touching and thus help create an emotional bond with your home," Erfan says.
'You don't fall in love with an the electric on the wall.
It's important, but don't make the heart tongues ring. '
It shows that good design and increased surface area help make a fairly ordinary apartment something amazing from.
In fact, they may even cause a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
Dane Jensen is a chief fundraiser in the Chicago skyscraper, who competes with a colleague for an.
not other than the amount of money earned, next to which all ethics will forgotten.
His wife and three children are seen by a man just early in the morning and late at night.
In the first half of the film, I get myself the idea that it is, after all, a version of the business world of "The Beautiful" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's are similar.
The film goes on, the less cadrimental element remains, and the moralising intention of the filmmakers is increasingly beginning to stand out.
A life-changing experience becomes cancer the protagonist's son of.
The choice needs to now be made between work and family life.
A son dreaming of an architectural agency makes his father, walk to great buildings of Chicago's, think about really important things like faith, goodness, love... without touching even the disaster of the twin towers.
After the third scene in which the son opens his father's eyes, a sense that the filmmakers have proceeded from the goal of certainly crying the audience, even the viewer with the most heart is unable to hold back tears by seeing the suffering of a beloved cancer-stricken boy.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally understands the morality of his work and does a to an old man looking for work.
Now I making a bet with myself - if the film has happy, I reward my perceptiveness after the film with a coffee, if I am wrong, then the scriptwriter can be commended for at least one surprise.
For a moment, the suspicion arises that I will miss my coffee - when the husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man rushes the palate of the corridor in slow motion.
But the son has grown wonderfully, and even though his father has just lost his job, it is also a positive thing, because now, after it is time to deal with his family.
I can also feel good - I can predict the end of the American drama quite well!
In the truth, the film is well constructed, all the elements needed for it are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, actors are good and morale beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I suppose this film brings in well.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually get on with it.
In this case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the White House's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information reaching President Trumpin, including news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in more water.
Here's the split from reporter Josh Dawseylt:
'When the White House's new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, got together with high-ranking officials on his first day in office, he pointed out a key problem for President Donald Trump in the White House, which he planned to resolve with the of bad information coming into the hands president's.
Kelly told officials that the information had to move through him, whether on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was had good information. '
Kelly's diagnosis seems entirely logical, but others have tried it too, and they have failed to tame Trump by tracking his media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television dates back decades, and even now that he is in the White House, his television viewing habits have gone nowhere.
"If candidate Trump had dishonest media coverage after being upset, it paid him to show that he was featured in influential publications also honestly," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that 'according to six former campaign, the key to managing Trump's's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal staff members media consumption also steadily includes the praises'.
Good enough.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter use habits have ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign staff know something that the rest of us don't know Taj that Trump's sparks would have been even more combustible without their interventions.
We will probably never find out about the sparks that Trump didn't post.
When his helpers were able to save him a few times from the trouble, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from continually stirring controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, composed of clicks competing with each other, people are exclusively trying to promote their own interests by passing on material to Trumpi that supports their worldviews but may not always be credible.
Reporting the full story, Politico wrote in May about advisers' tendency to feed strategically questionable information to the president.
One of the examples, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher, reads:
'The current and former Trump subordinates say that Trump may react to negative press, particularly damaging effects on infections, by exploding, taking obsession with identifying their source.
This was also the case in late February, when someone gave a two-dimensional copy of an article on the website GotNews.com GotNews.com, owned by internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walshi of being a the president White House "source of of multiple information." at the
It makes no difference that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of mocking, or that he did not offer any specific evidence, or that he has made false accusations in the past and withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and began inheriting from subordinates about Walshi. '
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and White House chief of staff, Rob Porter, "have been introduce a system to manage and document documents that reach Trumpin."
How did it succeed?
Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove Priebus to be a more effective leader, however, Trump is still impulsive and his helpers are still vying for influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad in the capital are reluctant to obtain permission to.
are going to be many foreigners in the city centre of Tallinn.
Those with whom the Job came spoke confessed to playing in the Old Town without the permission of the town hall.
We first found three street musicians close to the gates of Viru's who had taken the same number of dogs with them.
It was clearly seen that musicians with recreational and burst clothes were backpackers, who would be one shower for a berries.
Despite the appearance, the socialite's only woman played a story with an amusing rhythm on the accordion, while one man juggled alongside her with three balls and invited the passers closer.
A third man had sat next to them on one backpack and smoked a in the heart.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing nation.
Bob, who played the accordion with Noemi and juggled with balls, spoke out kissing the streets for both fun and money.
The aim of the group was to collect the ticket money for a ship travelling to Finland on the same day evening.
On the question of whether they asked the city for permission to muscle in the Old Town, Noemi and Bob shook their heads.
First, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple and most of the time will be given permits for a month or something like that.
There's no point paying for it ', explained Bob.
When we got back to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw two women being with musicians and chasing them away.
The socialite moved with backpacks and dogs to the Viru Centre roundabout for luck.
There were also three Polish young men on Viru Street, one of whom played fiddle, the other a clarnet, and the third was carrying an electronic piano.
'We're here to provide entertainment people to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living',, explained trio pianist Mivosh.
Mivoshi said they are aware that the municipality's permission must be in place for the occurrence.
'Of course we don't have it', he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music then there's no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we go elsewhere, but try must, "he added.
The Bank of Estonia bought bonds for EUR 149 million in July as part of the public asset purchase programme of the central banks euro area, while the central bank's bond portfolio grew to a total of EUR 4.36 billion.
The Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases.
The President of the Bank of Estonia, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained in response to a request from members of the Riigikogu that the asset purchase plan of the central banks of the Eurosystem comprises three different purchasing programmes: covered bonds the financial sector (covered bonds), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The Central Bank is buying bonds from the market to inspire investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
As a result of purchases, the yield on lower-risk assets will fall, and this will motivate investors to take greater risks.
As a rule, under a public debt-buying program, each central bank buys its state government bonds, other bonds are not bought.
As the Estonian state has not issued bonds, the Bank of Estonia is doing so-called replacement purchases within the amount allocated to them.
purchases are also carried out by central banks in countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
According to Hansson, the Bank of Estonia generally buys the bonds of the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
The Bank of Estonia buys bonds as part of asset purchase program from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering bonds were acquired, but the Bank of Estonia will no longer buy Elering bonds from June 2016.
On behalf of the central banks of the euro area, the Finnish central bank will buy both Elering and Estonian Energy Bonds from June.
Travellers ignore ditch and return to 'millionaire division'
Some of the West Midlands's most affluent home owners have come back into fierce confrontation with determined who have ignored a council-dug ditch to win back a field away from their villas.
Wanders have parked their 20 caravans on the field for a wealthy "millionaires" near the Solihull Street.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks after they were only kicked out there in May without being blended by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactic group found a weak spot in the defence limit, squeezing their vehicles through an unblocked section that had been left to the walkway.
Furious residents have bashed Solihull council, saying the council is "useless in dealing with the problem."
One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after banishing them from Bentley Heath, where they stoned passers.
The council needs to be shamed for taking action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, they were driven away and now they are back again.
They had more came last night, probably more today. '
He added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with such things by acquiring long hurdles to protect their parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy I have to continue paying the council tax if the council can't even block this of thing. '
One local resident, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said: 'It is ridiculous. We have only seen the last of these migrants leave, and a new offensive is already taking place.
This time the number has increased and the grassland has even seen the horse remember. '
A spokesman for Solihull council said: 'We are aware that there is an unacceptable campsite in the land near Streetsbrook Road and we are working with Solihull police. We are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
Gathering evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to police by calling number 101.
It helps to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them. '
The weekend festival will be visited by the Minister of Culture, Indrek Saar, among others, who is pleased that the real world's top names have been brought to Estonia.
Asked why the Weekend Festival is so important for Estonians, the island replies that it should be asked by all those who enjoy the festival's three-day story in full.
But he says that the real players in his area have come to Pärnu.
"If you look at this level of artists that you have been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre are brought home - this is not often the case in our," the Minister for Culture says.
Which of the Isle artists at the festival, however, are the most telling itself?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for old men like me, surely one of the most experienced artist is Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
According to his record, all of us at some point have turned our feet ', he says.
But he still brings out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
own Estonian players are, Of course: starting with NO < and you can read a whole series.
In reality, this renowned concentration of names is very high, "he says.

Audi upgrades car manufacturers amid criticism of up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
A day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it was offering software improvements more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities, including BMW's home town of Munich, which has considered banning or throttling diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
No company described these operations as a recall.
European car manufacturers have been actively promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with regulations on carbon emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment to neutralise diesel emissions will increase for car companies, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of branding powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring signs indicating the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which quipped about the use of so-called fraudulent devices, which made it possible to adjust the regulations when exhaust gases car was, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics subunit of the Audi engine development department in Germany was arrested.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and can go to trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was pulled into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when authorities accused Audit of installing the system to evade European emissions collections claims, thereby expanding an investigation that had focused on the past United States.
Audi's involvement in the investigation could be a big blow for Volkswagen, the manufacturer of luxury cars generating a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
Estonian schools receive European Union flags for EUR 20 000.
The Ministry of Education plans to purchase European Union flags to Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
In total, the 105 x 158 centimetres of the European Union flag to 570 educational institutions.
The flags are designed for exhibiting indoors, they must be performed indoors in high-quality printing technology, with tunnel confirmation, the ERR news portal.

Journalist's murder highlights growing threat in Mexico
Workers at weekly newspaper Riodoce typically gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug dealers.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They are told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists are discussing which looks safer: either bring the children with them to an office that was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words to a billboard headed by the space: "enemies," "neutral," "allies."
They ask reporters to offer names in every column there is no need for evidence, enough impressions and a sense of inside.
On the payroll of government or cartels, suspected drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are a whole list of villains making it dangerous to to have reflect the chaos in Mexico.
There is no respite from violence, and the more dead bodies are accumulated across the country, the majority of them are journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, since President Enrique Pena Nieto was sworn office in December 2012 at least 25. 589 journalists have been under national protection following attacks and threats, and so far this year at least seven journalists in seven states have been.
The latest deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, though his presence can be perceived everywhere on the facade of the Taj Riodoce building hangs a large picture of Valdez pointing the middle finger, with the letter "Justice" and two 30 s reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts depicted with his smiling glasses on the face or his characteristic.
The meeting comes less than two months after he died. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate state prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, only two cases have been prosecuted, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, numbering thousands, the killers of journalists rarely come to justice.
Riodoce's editorial continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data and justice the murderers, the security meeting, according to Ibarra, will do of little use.
"It's very raw to waste your time here in the meeting," he says.
"As long as the cause is not known, you will distrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive only a few quarters before he was stopped by two men in the red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and shot 12 times, presumably because of the name newspaper's, which translately means' "the twelfth river.
An armed man drove away in Valdez's car and made an emergency in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left behind by a woman and two adult children.
Rumours spread freely in Culiacan.
However, there is, only silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival clicks struggle to fill the power vacuum.
It makes no difference that on the streets of Sinaloa a person people, or even several, are shot every day, or that the graveyard is teeming with abundantly decorated mausoleums of drug royals larger than the homes of many living.
Let us forget for a moment that peacetime refers to how only one cartel runs the seaside state with precious ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was thoroughly aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and chair of Riodoce's, feels huge scruples that he could to protect his friend.
He believes the killing was favoured by two mistakes.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a rival and wartime cartel click with Guzman's sons,.
This piece of literature may have angered the sons suspected gang members bought all copies of the edition as soon as they arrived in newspaper pieces.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own security after a raid took place in another newspaper editor that reported the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had stayed alive for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would exist permanently.
He worked as a veteran reporter at Noroeste newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said it was "impossible to deal with the press without the drug problem" in Sinaloa.
The newspaper collected its reputation with bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish robust studies without fear of censorship and readers in a snowy print that they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Caboti Award for its Latin American coverage.
That same year, Valdez won the International Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) International for Freedom Award the Press for her courage to follow Mexico's drug colole wherever it leads.
He openly admitted he was afraid.
"I want to live on," she said accepting the AKK award.
Last October, he told in an interview the television channel Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
'You have to take on the task that the journalist's office has with Bec's second chance is to play fool.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't talk about what was going on. '
Riodoce's collective longs for Valdez, a joke who roped like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared embassies and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from office across the road to the El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if her routine love became fatal to her.
His death has also led them to question themselves how best to do their work and stay alive.
'They don't like being stuck with these women, their children, their legal businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs.'
"These things weren't allowed to be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is strong self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspiciously, keep away.
to Andres Villarreali, editor of riodoce, the problem is that "the brain of smell can be cheated... and so this thing happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply to the toxic mix of Tamaulipasis, Veracruz, Guerrero or other states that are home to lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees got together for security training, suddenly mobile phones were no longer allowed; days before that, it was revealed that only spyware sold to governments had been used to track journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers searched for relief from the 40-degree heat under the cover of a tree.
The government appointed them to guard the Riodoce office, located in a four-storey building in Culiacan's middle-class neighbourhood.
Some reporters pondered in half-jokingly whether these police officers were among the 50 per cent police officers whose governor himself has brushed untrustworthy.
Several months have passed since reporters have traveled to mountainous countryside, where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
Riodoce's edition this week addressed three main stories.
One was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement as to who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows about the Taj is a state of mind for drug dealers and the authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered to the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics the last century.
More recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption as part of widespread coverage of lawsuits.
Villarreal asked a reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, who was wearing the nickname El Chapo, escaped from a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have been looking for Valdez column to obtain information from the best sources on the kidnapping.
"In the past we'd already known what had happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose clunky body building has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
'Now all channels of communication have broken down with our sources.'
Valdez The office has become a storage space for labels and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they could never expect from Taj activists on behalf of of the Press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of shots and headed to the local prosecutor's cabinet the next morning for a rally for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A dead body has been found, and according to officials, it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists have become more vocal across the country, and as an organised protest, criticise the phrase "SOS press" on pavements and buildings.
On that day, President Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to garner international support in the Valdez case for justice.
A day after Valdez's death while meeting with Sinaloa's governor, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because of telling the truth.
, She asked for her to be diverted from the government's coverage of the actions, worrying that anger had affected her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "besieged" by organized crime, complicit state officials and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "The Narcotics Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but are also done at the behest of politicians and security forces who are involved in organized crime.
Media monitoring group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists to police and state officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because you're meant to be silenced," Ramirez said.
Murders obviously have a bleeding effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipasis six years ago.
His dead body was found, along with a letter presumably signed by a cartel in Los Zetas: "I am here for my reports."
Next to his painted head, computer and headphones leaked.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others let on as El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their chair in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with the headline "What do you want from us?."
Some journalists have fled home countries or even the country.
This is a nerve-racking decision.
It is hard to find work in exile and they still have to cross the streets to avoid the dangers.
And sometimes they are being chased, as happened to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in 2015 in one Mexican apartment three months after being banished from Veracruz.
Those who remain in place and continue to work need to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits he is horrified by coverage of the drug business.
"Mexico is on its way to hell and that's why I started to be a reporter," he said.
At midnight on one recent Friday, when the latest number had already been slammed, the editors of Riodoce sat on the pavement in front of the office and looted beer when suddenly everyone's phones began vibrating.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people had died in fire exchanges between rival gangs and security forces, according to confirmed data.
The war continued to escalate, as several messages left by cartels found in the area also promised.
From the more edge of the pavement, reporters lined up Riodoce's website using the news mobile phone.
The front cover for the next day needed a change.
Sirens snuffed along the Taj for another fire exchange of in the area.
Bojorquez was peppered police officers on call to see if they were vigilant.
If they were afraid, at least they did not show it.
Under a massive portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, under with his average finger seen throughout Sinalova, the Riodoce staff delivered in his footsteps.
"How could one think about shutting down at all," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, the apprentice asked me to send him to the streets to report?"
Dinosaur used protective colour to avoid foes
At first glance, it looks like a shape, albeit quite scary.
Scientists have now revealed the first findings in relation to the incredible rhino-size being discovered by the chicken miner, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as "Mona Lisat of dinosaurs."
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that the skin covered by his sodomy had a red-brown colour and his past had been somewhat 'sophisticated'.
A report published in the journal Current Biology described the creature as "the best preserved testosterone dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaur trends in the world."
The fossil is a new type of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of a scratch age, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation stunned researchers who describe it as "truly significant."
This testy-covered vegetarian is best preserved the type of fossils ever found, according to the magazine National Geographic.
It was found on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he was mining at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that didn't resemble the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossils discovery of the was sent to the Royal Tyrrell.
The next six years were working to dig the animal out of the 2,500-pound (1,100-kiloed) plot.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be brought to the public.
"If you a little bit eyes, you can almost believe that he is asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the Being is exhibited.
'It goes into the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
When researching his skin, researchers found that this plant worker, while covered in sodomy and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely to be significantly threatened by meat-driven dinosaurs.
This dinosaur used red and white protective colours to hide from predators, and applied a concealment technique called, which is also used by many of today's animals.
This allowed the dinosaur to blend better into the surroundings and avoid foes, according to experts, as the larger dinosaurs probably kept a hunt for him.
This 110 million-year-old family of nodosaurs first came to the news in May and is now being visited at the Royal Tyrrell paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now studied the Being and named after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory at the Borealopelta pickmitchelli museum, who belonged to a team that spent more than 7,000 hours exposing the animal to painstaking expose.
Thanks to the astonishingly good preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the armoured on the animal's body.
They discovered a counter-narrative - a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, which means that the opposing side of the being was darker than the bottom.
Although the counter-eclipse is common, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much larger than nowadays living countershadowy animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur was actively enough hunted by other muscle-eating dinosaurs, that evolution preferred to hide instead of confrontation as a survival tactic.
But most modern-day countershadowy animals - such as deer, mushrooms or armadles - are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nodosaurus had to make a real effort to survive.
"The vigorous hunting of a dinosaur covered with huge and abundant testicles shows just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the scratch age could have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds of sodomy also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was brown.
Scientists will continue to study the animal to get clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its intestine, to figure out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe the dinosaur crashed into dying river, thereby reaching a stream into the sea, where it sunk its spine in front of the the ocean bottom.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans probably stretched far further inland than they are now.
'This nodosaurus is truly remarkable as she is fully covered with preserved skin, while also remaining three-dimensional, maintaining the animal's original shape,' Brown said.
'As a result, the animal nowadays looks almost the same as in the age of scratch.
You don't have to use imagination very much to reconstruct it - you just need to shovel your eyes and it seems like. '
The crisis era was a time when huge two-legged dinosaurs - theropoodles - were lulled on Earth.
While their all-king Tyrannosaurus rex of lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armoured dinosaur could been hunted down by some of its formidable predecessors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 ft (11.5 meters) tall and six-tonne weighing monster.
Researchers, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was washed into the sea after death and it mummed in the mud.
The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, when it the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved sodomy dinosaur in the world, including leather and testosterone, and is comprehensive from consolation to hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five metres) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Two 20-inch-tall ora penetrated out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe this sodomy-covered plant worker adventured through the current western Canada until the flooded river in its offshore.
But the burial place of the dinosaur helped to preserve the splendidly detail of its armour.
The fossilised remnants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that mythical armoured plates along the dinosaur's headlights still cover the leather.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the journal National Geographic: 'Such degree of preservation is as rare as a lottery victory.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it looks.
The fossilised leather leaves still cover the mythical armoured plates located on the animal's skull.
The right front leg is lying next to him, and the five toes are stretched upwards.
I'll be able to count the testicles on his feet. '
How did one activist find an answer to the question "Who's streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell received full shock.
Just a day after travelling to New York, this St. Louise resident sat in Airbnb via a rented room on a bed, browsing Facebook on the phone.
He ended up on the post of his former schoolmate.
It read: "The police have just killed an 18-year-old youngster and he is still lying in the street."
She was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on her stream, which is why she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Posts by the feast @ TheePharoah user had been repeatedly shared on his timeline.
from the area Louise broadcast a real-time sparkle about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson,, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, remaining there for four hours.
"It's insane," Ferrell thought of himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away but saw the sparkle again later in the evening, which this time reported a gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
Photos were shared of police tape and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and held a tag with the letter "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a real-time stream where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, according to him, a gun and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell resembles how he hit himself with the thought: "It's unusual."
"" This is not the kind of murder that we are accustomed to and that we could call typical. "
I felt horrified at that point.
I was angry and I was crying. '
He booked a return flight and travelled home the next day.
Having landed at 23, he went to his father for his six-year-old daughter and decided they would be driving the next morning twin Ferguson.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is a central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Who's the streets?"), which will premiere in cinemas on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and siteness from the perspective of those people who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell, with her daughter - who had a flowery dress her back and a fitting crown in her head - travelled towards Ferguson, they were again chatting about an issue they had repeatedly talked about before that morning - about the experiences of black people and living conditions.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for their rights?" she recalls asking herself.
'We're driving in Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right.'
"I couldn't take him along," Ferrell later said.
'What's happening now is... the culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
She needs to learn about activism and organisation and, at the same time, know the different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we need to do to be free and free.
Even if I manage to bring him up so that he doesn't personally experience blatant racism, he's no different from some other black girl.
I feel I would do him a disservice if I protected him from this world. '
The first stop they made when they arrived in Ferguson was South Florissant on the - from a police station in a place across the road that had become a sort of camp site where activists were waiting for news about police officer Darren Wilson, who was ultimately not charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who was preparing the.
They put food bags together and helped them to the protesters.
For ferrell, a new type of activism began to slowly take shape.
"My activism completely changed after 9 August," she said, noting that when she was a student at Missouri-St. Louise University, she was president of the Alliance Association of Minority Students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
'I didn't have any organizing experience.
It all just smeared. '
Weeks later, Ferrell met with one of the films co-director Sabaah Folayan, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was going on.
came mind with the question: "Are you trying to document what's going on or find a story that can be exploited?"
Such scepticism was the result of an unread number of cases in which people - often pain-mongering - come into the community and try to profit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson would not be heard and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already struck hands with fellow director Damon Davis, an artist from the region who was known for activism in relation to death row inmates.
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrell and six other locals, who were watched by the team in the movie "Whose Streets?" after Brown's shooting for years.
"In this documentary, nobody speaks for us or with us, but we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
'It was important to me how these people are portrayed, because that is how I am portrayed.'
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was intended to show that the movement was not about "redemption, but about bringing the community together," as Folayan said - he became the most open participant in the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" is documenting surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as grace and getting married to his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the ready-made tape.
'But I realized that doing this job and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability.'
What's more, Ferrell's story highlights and replaces the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three instigators, who thought on social media in the of the 2012 killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin the hashtag # BlackLivesMatter,, are gay.
"In a leading role, black homosexual women have maintained the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and this is precisely because we have to fight constantly on multiple fronts.
Black homosexual women must bear all that burden. '
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women."
He argues, however, that "this is not some kind of thing of creating equal opportunities" - Ferrell was not chosen as the centre of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who was airing the right energy," he said.
'But it's no coincidence that she was directly on the frontline because there's a lot at stake when living as a black homosexual woman at such hubs.
His energy can be perceived through the screen. '
Meanwhile, news cameras have long disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and police remain fragile.
The suspended sentence imposed on ferrell for blocking the road during a demonstration will last another 2.5 years.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere in the region, which she calls home, as simply a "hatchback."
Nevertheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra he has corroborated in memory since he took to the streets of Ferguson a full three years ago.
'It's our responsibility to fight for our freedom.
It is our responsibility to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We don't have to lose anything but our chains. '
7 tricks how to get the after the Weekend feast

Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee are being sought behind as suspects in murder
According to police, a professor at University Northwester and an Oxford University employee who has become suspects after finding the dead body of a man-made burner with deadly stabbing wounds in one of Chicago's luxury apartments is being searched nationwide.
According to court documents in Cook County, arrest warrants for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathemi and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were issued on Monday without charges because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbing.
The dead body was discovered on July 27, according to a warning issued by the Chicago police department to the community.
Police officers received a phone call and found the victim with multiple stab wounds on her body when arriving at the Grand Plaza apartment block.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and investigators are treating the stabbing as murder while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwester University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president of public relations, said in a statement emailed that Lathem had now been temporarily removed from work and had been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal case being investigated by the competent authorities, and the University of Northwestern is cooperating with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant in the finance department of Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and ready to assist the US investigation authorities in any way we can."
In addition, the statement said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wished he would extradite himself.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the Chicago police department of communications, urges the suspects to hand themselves up to authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but we are working defining the exact location increasingly intensively on," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to search the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from an administrator at the Grand Plaza apartment building who had received just a cryptic tip that something had happened in the apartment at No 1008.
According to police descriptions, the act was a gruesome sight.
Guglielmi said it was not clear whether the event itself also took place on July 27.
cameras confirm Lathemi and Warren's stay in the building He said security.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
The Grand Plaza leadership sent a letter to residents saying: "Police are currently working to identify the chronology of events and the victim's background, and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that the act was a family visit."
Start-ups that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett was keen to measure worker satisfaction at his e-commerce start-up, but polls were futile.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse still, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some staff didn't trust the process.
"This system just wasn't consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs an e-commerce company sells hair care products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called to the of external individuals.
new type of human resources start-ups are emerging to help companies figure out what their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software that is strongly designed measure employee involvement, they allow companies to conduct snap surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer anonymity to employees and a hot line for lodging complaints, and in some cases allow language to bypass C-level managers and directly address the board.
"There are now tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
Erretti said he has got a much better view of what his staff think and feel in the three years he has used Glint.
In addition to flash resorts and surveys targeting at specific teams, it offers a thermal card for the company, which provides insight into which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing it to identify the reasons.
Companies are beginning to understand that they need to stay in touch with their work culture in order not to become the next Uber, which has been embroiled in scandals since a former employee published a blog post that described a harrowing environment in which those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, the desire to have an insight is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation and conformity could be worth more than 118.7 billion by 2020, according to data from financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, start-up in denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, observed an increase in interest and activity this year amid Uber's dubious reputation.
Convercentil has nearly 600 customers, among them Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered himself as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent allows companies to send customized impulse surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, the complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has been anchored by regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and chief executive of Convercenti.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, the company could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee leaving and lawsuits, even if regulators don't intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 sites, has used Convercenti for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of rules and operations and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporation's headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find a phone number or email address the corporation's headquarters, lodge a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a daunting and awkward process, said James Vitrano, general adviser to Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
However, now that the company is using Convercenti, problems such as discrimination, harassment or dishonest wage practices that did not previously reach out to leaders who operated in offices in other cities or states can be more quickly identified and dealt with.
"I am able to get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of the workers," said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we will protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said companies began taking ethical behaviour, values and employee engagement much more seriously in 2002, after auditor firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations over the Enron scandal.
But it was only when "social media became mature" that companies realised they could not prevent their black lingerie from publicly washing the web.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking periodic fees from companies for using their products.
It's a business model and an option with the approval of venture capital investors, who have been a prop for both start-ups.
Convercenti was funded 10 million in February by firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thereby raising the capital collected to a value of 47 million.
Glint invested 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, raising the company's total funding to 60 million.
Such investments will come as no surprise, given the interconnectedness between businesses, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that today's workers expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are merely stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy in the company, feel they are being listened to and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, vice president of the Department General Benefits and Workers' Experience at LinkedInis, which uses both Convercenti and Glint.
Investors are making returns when their portfolio companies are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-half analytics tools promise to increase the commitment and engagement of workers, it's no wonder they will find support.
Having data on the workers involvement is important, according to professional culture experts.
But this data will be useless if the company's supervisors do nothing about it.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can generate expectations that the changes ahead.
And if changes don't happen quickly enough or not at all, it can cause disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consultancy and business management company Kotter International, which has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things are brought to an end, the staff are wondering thinking," Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care? ""
Erretti said Madison Reed, who now conducts six studies among staff, has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees who were frustrated the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams at the company and provide communication training to deal with problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, will collect new data on workers and it is hoped that in the long term it will bring with it a longer-term commitment of workers in an industry known for its high workforce.
"If you're not committed to ensuring transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
'And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you lose businesses. '
The star eurozone is Baltics: Earnings grow fast
While the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are fast approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes in a reference to the European Central Bank report by.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, the total economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
success is due to low indebtedness, fast-improving institutions and business and free-market policies.
"The Baltic States, together with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where real GDP per capita purchasing power has significantly approached the EU average," the central bank reported.
Although the goal is for the total economic output per capita to equate to a richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita represented just 2/3 of the average of 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led baltans to seek better wages from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, the local people are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of people in Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, just under half of those surveyed thought this about their countries' economies.
Ncaa's decision to cancel twice-daily trolls makes Bruins' days long
'clock, At almost 23 o UCLA footballers stop chatting at the edge of a new practice pitch on the team's campus.
Some of them have peeled off the back of a shirt, revealing a back from their workout camp's first-day effort.
For much of the team, these idle minutes offer a midday break.
Players taking part in the summer courses will be heading back to training for the final exams after a three-hour stunt, before returning to the Wasserman football centre at 6.30 am the next morning.
"The next three days will be a real ordeal for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
Ncaa's decision to cancel twice-a-day trolls to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer - at least until one-half with the final exams on Friday.
For that reason, UCLA's first three workouts were timed to start at 19.15 to fit into the players' already tight schedule.
The switch from two workouts a day means more days with one ace - the start of the Bruins' training camp was elevated to almost a week's forward compared to last season and for the first time in Mora's six Westwood seasons workouts during summer courses.
They have 18 aces planned until August 20 before starting official preparation for the opening game against Texas A & M in September.
The MORA says it is in favour of an NCAA rule change, although it adds another item to the agenda in the tight of players.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days and that's a serious challenge," Mora said.
'And they're breaking themselves through this ordeal; they're struggling, they're nice young.
I believe that when Saturday arrives and we have more time, it's really cosy. '
Once the camp is finished, UCLA's workouts will be closed, which is not an easy task, given the clear view of the parking site close to their squares and the Luskin Center, however a higher-class hotel that has already been hit with soccer survivors from the defensive network surrounding the colour mail.
Bruins players, the hotel will As this weekend, but Mora admitted problems could occur with free rooms for the season.
"We are implementing security measures," Mora said.
'It's a real place of concern and it's not exaggerated at all to think people might be renting a room and filming a workout from there.
If you have a record of a workout, you can do a pretty good deal with it.
But we use a security team there and in the 8 th parking site.
We will do our best by using what we have.
I will try not to worry much about that.
We have a plan in place. '
In retaliation for the election Union of SavisFarsi-Ivanova, Kristiina Ojuland, expelled from the Reform League Party, and Maria Kaljuste, who was to depart from ECHR, about created up Our Tallinn and for the party children, the Active Tallinn electoral alliance of businessmen, seems to show taking in local elections this year at least as many political parties as in.
The chickens will be counted in the autumn, however, and the key question will be whether there will be enough frustrated voters for all of them.
Who is left with the Savisary?
How small the support team of Edgar Savistreasure has can can guess from the events organised in honour of his electoral union.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current central parties and many unfamiliar faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And can the reason why some of the faithful followers and friends of the treasure treasure aside from their candidacy in Tallinn be to see that the "" of business bankers, led by and corruption, is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the rooftop of the for a Russian-made pop video a senior in the Lasnamäe district; and a rudimentary computer game in which in every sense the protagonist, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, on the wheel, must avoid lomps and squirrels on the way - will is this way the Central Party, is for the first time, the votes of the voters who of 16 and 17 years allowed to the ballot boxes?
We look forward to seeing other parties' perceptions of a youth election campaign.
If Canal the 2 or TV3 viewers watch a black square instead of entertainment option, from the beginning of August, there will be two choices: to accept that in the future only ETV, ETV2, ETV +, Tallinn TV and the English France24 channels will be seen in the freeway, or to surrender to operators each month.
There are probably also those who, at first, openly rejoice in the advertising-free television experience, but at the end of the day albeit reluctantly pay for TV pictures and advertisements.
The deafening music, the noisy nation and the trash left on the streets are the unpleasant side-effects of almost every major music festival.
If you do not want to be part of the meltdown yourself, if, it is worth discovering the instead of casting your at home - and leaving the place of sleeping for a hefty amount to the festival guests.
Washington changes green card rules
Media outlets quote President Donald Trump saying a new US immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the green card.
The plan envisages a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and the president supports them.
The bill goes to be in two chambers of Congress.
'This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers' money as it changes the way the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and begin to replace the current program.
The new application process an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the funds to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, according to US media outlets.
Siberian seto youngsters move into town, pensioners back to land.
Yevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous seto gold miners along the river Maana River.
He works from his home 140 kilometres from Maana tributary in Kuvai on the of a gold cartel as a motorist driver.
It is a tough job: two months without rest 12 hours of work, and then only ten days at home and again.
During the three years worked in the artellis, Anatoli has seen gold only once.
'There's a gorgeous procedure hard: a thorough checked going in so that the vodka do bring, and going out to not take be the gold', Anatoli says.
Mare Piho chatted with local seto Jaan in the village of Haida, who has told him a great deal about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The archaic culture still preserved in the Siberian sethos is also beginning to affect the, because it's just so fabulous, thinks Piho Mare the most thoroughly distant sethos.
His first exploration trip to Siberia will be 30 years this year.
During this period he has been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many settles, after all, roamed to Siberia at the end of the 19 th century and the beginning of the 20 th century to gain land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I would argue that 8 000.
I took this out of the story of the Siberian seto men, who have thought about it themselves.
It is hard say exactly, because up to 30 people may have come in one group at the time, but the passport was only given to a man.
The passport was granted to only one, but with him were children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look how great the territory was here!
This was many times greater than the historical Setown.
After all, it needed to be educated, managed in some way.
The setod came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture but also to the river (prayer fertilisation), gold mines, industry.
In New Petseri, for example, many of the setod later went to work in the classified city of Krasnojarsk-45 (where the Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P.), when it was formed.
Did the setod form the majority of the population in this region at the time?
Yes, they lived compact.
In addition, the tradition of marrying and having a many children survived.
Seven to eight children in the family were common.
How much did the Siberian sethos culture differ and differ from that of the of the mother country?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought with them a great number of people.
They did themselves (folk leaders), but they always made a distinction between what had been brought along and what had been done here.
Climate change has a impact by traditional dressing of, because it is colder here after all.
The foods changed.
For example, in Setown, meat was salted, but here it was simply frozen.
Where are the Siberian setode villages and what life is lived there?/graphics: Alari Paluots
The bond with the mother country was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is going to give back there, it is going to affect them.
These girls, who have lived in families here, have listened to amazing stories.
Piho has in mind the people of the Estonian delegation who came to Haida village the Day of the Kingdom of the Seto at the beginning of July and lived for four days in their homes - J. P.
What's left here, it's fabulous.
"It to come to the kill and go away as well, because the city has a is all too great location: at the railway intersection and at the intersection of roads," says opera insulist Reigo Tamm, an from Tapalt.
The city is no longer just a military capital; we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural places, and the seal gets in every corner.
Kill is a top-topp city!
From the city through the Great River of Light, there is a small island where the killers tend to hold a hunting boat.
'This doesn't look like beautiful place a train window', quips Reigo.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in this river because the river is full of sources.
I have been swimming there, I can do it!
The river column can hold the picnic and just make a romance - you can watch the river flow and think ahead and behind life.
I have also been there walking with my brides.
The Tamm, apart from everything else, has been on the river shore between three bridges, practicing his treasure sites: "As this place is on the side of the city, no one may come up against if I my stories."
"There is a wonderful view of Tapale from the mountain mountain, but there are also health where you can run, skiing and play discgolf now, for example - the golf track is done, the disks can be borrowed from the the winter sports centre,," presides Reigo.
The old profiles, of course, go there with their disks, but I have not yet been able to play there.
Obviously, my colleague Rasmus Kull Tapale must be invited to visit because he has experienced a discgolfing player and has disks.
Maybe he will lend me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable from the childhood times of the current opera isolation.
At least during the ski hours.
There are a lot of tears, disappointments left on this mountain and you can in my sporting life.
Not to mention broken bells and skis.
"The entire city centre is currently full of construction works, all this is going to become unrecognisable," praises Reigo.
Tapa's old and tired carpet building, however, is a very attractive place to play summer discoveries.
I am pleased that Märt Meos, the head of the R.A.A.A.A.M. in 2012, accepted my idea and had to make a summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with Aleksei Karenin has just come to an end, on 11 August the railway station is "" Living, "when the old vacuum building is moving around in the 1980 s.
"From 11 to 13 August, the city of Tapa is the days of the open home of a building and cultural events are in, including a," says Reigo, who advises to city just in those days.
In the tiny yellow house on the 1 May wooden front, the museum has been around since 1994.
"The house is small, but are well exhibits and the information," praises Reigo's place, is full of the history of Tapa City, most of which focuses on rail and warfare.
Reigo reigns that if Tapal goes through all the recommended places, the belly will go empty for a long time, but thankfully the small town is full of cafés.
'We have such good meals and sitting in cafes sometimes you get the feeling that you're abroad', she describes.
Well-educated and young soldiers who come to Tapale spend a lot of time in pubs and cafés, so there is a fascinating feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home town, but is of international community together.
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to the stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we are moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
BTV, the television channel, quoted the foreign ministry as reporting that two Bulgarians were taken into custody in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of 1 August, police arrested a group of people illegally camped on the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but an investigation is currently under way.
The Foreign Ministry told the TV channel bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone caught on holiday in a place not intended to do so.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The court could impose the fine the ministry said.
Wolves who teach puppies are to break sheep.
a year's, farmers in hiiumaa will again have to give their shepherd "educational material" to the wolves - wolves who have apparently taught puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep on three occasions, with a total of 23 sheep and eight injured, writes Hiiu Leaf.
Last year, the number was only three, a year earlier 124.
There are also data from the Environment Agency that there were no wolf in Hiiumaa and information the Hiiumaa hunting board that two wolf factories have been fixed on the island this year.
On the night against Monday, wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in Emmaste Municipality and injured half of the 18 surviving sheep.
In the early hours of Wednesday morning, wolves broke one sheep in pasture of the the village of Reheselja and badly injured another, who had to be made an emergency cardboard.
rules for the treatment genetically modified crops must be
The Department of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOVS) and amending the Plant Protection Act to the Coordination Circle.
The amendment of the law renounces the creation of a separate database for both GM crop locations and handlers, with a plant health register to be used in the future.
In addition, the obligation of GM crop handler to have a prior agreement within a prescribed radius with a beekeeping person will be changed.
Although are currently no GM crops cultivated in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non-modified crops.
This is at least as long as there is no decision to declare Estonia GMO-free, "Sigmar Suu, head of the plant health department at the Department of Earth, said.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be purposeful and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors," Suu added.
The draft law repeales provisions relating to the database and treatment training of GM crop locations and handlers in GMOVS, establishes requirements for the handling of GM crops and for the commencement of economic activity.
In with regard to beekeeping, the obligation of the GM crop grower to inform beekeepers about starting cultivation of GM crops is replaced by the obligation to reach an an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before starting cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to examine this in the draft information system and, if they so wish, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The changes planned will affect, in particular, those active in the field of plant, beekeepers and the Agricultural Authority.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize MON 810 - is allowed to be.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in cultivating GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no land lawyer in Estonia, a European corn, for which MON 810 is resistant.
varieties of this maize line have also been bred to the southern regions, and this corn is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
obtain certainty the above, the Department of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in seeds of various varieties of summer, maize and soya cultivated in Estonia.
Analyses of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain alien gene, and the study concluded that seeds of varieties that have of rapeseed, maize and soya grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that GM crops are not consciously cultivated in Estonia, and it was also confirmed that there had been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Maticu in form of 'genius'
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited Nemanja Maticu in the form of a "genius" after making his debut against midfield player Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, bought over from Chelsea for £40 m, started in Dublin Unitedi last pre-season game before the Uefa Super Cup final against Real Madrid on Tuesday with a 2-1 victory in the sub-division, impressing in a the defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go in the attacking moments.
But having been sidelined by the Blues' pre-season Asian culture, Maticul missed a matchup form and held only 45 minutes against, which Mourinho said must be improved from firm before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he has the mindset of football," Mourinho said.
'We will help him achieve form as soon as possible.'
Like Matic, other new recruits Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku began under-grivism at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho began quietly putting his eleven starting men in in place by the start of the the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed the club had already done a "great job" by signing contracts with three of his four priority selections.
"I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three of the four," he added.
'I'm still happier if they can make four out of four but they've worked hard for me.'
Another nose son got a the GSM presenter on 1 August and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird observer living in fingers, the first son of the month equipped with the Sõrves, and this laundry is already flying around, has left the bathtub wash and has joined the large overnight collection of Mullutu-Great Bay.
This is because there are no fruit fields in the, the Voice of the Islands writes.
This Tuesday, relatively late for the rings, another monthly son became attached to the sender and this was on the island of Muhu.
Martinson said the installation of the attendants was actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a monthly son called Mati GSM was supplied to Sõrves Turkjul.
'He His activities are all viewed on the Internet: how he went to Spain wintering, coming back for a long time on the German-Polish border and then coming to Saaremaa', Martinson spoke.
British inventor had to install a microchip in his body to get into the house and car with a handgun
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted a microchip so that he could simply open his front door, get into an office and even run a car with a handgun.
33-year-old Steven Northam was allowed to install a tiny chip between his thumb and name finger, and is now offering the service through his company, BioTeq, to companies and individuals seeking to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, consultant-anesthesiologist at the Royal Hospital Hampshire, in Winchester, to ensure the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip fitted to cats and dogs, and it takes just 30 seconds for the procedure.
Northam's company is also swapping house and car locks to make them compatible with a chip, asking for £300 for one lock.
This married father of one child has installed the technology now both at home and in his car in the BMW Z4, which gets under way when his hand is on the wheel.
White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands
According to military documents disclosed to the magazine TIME, the White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter cost taxpayers as much as 24, 000 for an event celebrating American production last month.
Green and white paint Sikorsky VH-3D, dubbed Marine One during the presidential boardroom, was the centrepiece of an event promoting American building programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials revamped industrial products from all 50 states on their tour.
The helicopter, built in, was exhibited along with a hunt from Main, a fire-fighting car from Wisconsin and a fork truck made in Mississippi.
According to documents from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House military office called for helicopter presence the department chief, or FARGOs, be narrowly 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern yard for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually high-profile event," the HMX-1 commander said the day before the event in an email to his boss, the deputy of the Navy's chief officer in the aviation industry.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at the southern courtyard for an event starting at 7 a.m. on the morning of July 17 and remain there until the yard is cleared between 18 and 21 on the same evening.
Added was the fact that if there was to be a delay in leaving the White House, the return flight would need a second because of restrictions on working time.
The original flight crew was at a helicopter during the event, and the squadron's security team remained near the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to read out from the documents given to the journal TIME whether the extract was eventually needed or not.
Hatchi's law prohibits federal employees from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event could violate that provision.
"We asked if it was violating the Hatch Act, and we were told not to violate," the commander wrote.
"It seems you have no choice," the deputy chief officer responded.
The White House declared the event "made in America" an official event, and Hatch's law would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The president backed the health care reform efforts on that had been under discussion in the Senate at the time and praised efforts to keep government regulations in.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents need to use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for photovoltaics is unusual.
Trump got into the spotlight in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, rolled into the background at the president's plane and his Twitter account is riddled with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the display of" America-made, "where products from all 50 states made by American workers from American materials were represented," said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokesman.
Hmx-1 teams often make sample flights around Washington and in the southern courtyard to practice catching up with the sentiment precinct of the President of the United States at the White House.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, the HMX-1 White House hosted 58 samples in the courtyard.
According to the official, the flight to was believed to be among the norm for the "America-made" flight crew that month training flights.
Squadron helicopters flew an additional 11 hours on that day for "non-presidential support missions."
According to the White House, no other exhibit of the event overwhelmed the taxpayer's purse.
Sikorsky's spokesman said the company was not involved in organising the exhibit on the southern yard of the helicopter.
Hmx-1 does not maintain budget documents for the president's flights and the exact costs of the event are hard to figure out.
But according to the Defense Department's hourly prices for the 2017 financial year, the VH-3D compensation rate is 24, 380 per hour of flight.
Documents from the squadron noted the flight length of its main base from Navy Quantico Airport, Virginia, on both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House claims the actual cost of using a helicopter is well below that amount.
"The calculation of taxpayers' costs based on estimated reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated benefit rates include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that will be taken into account in the annual envelope."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Defense Department's compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they do cover costs fuel, maintenance and contracts.
White House former spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the time at the event.
"The point of the matter is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
'And I know Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that there are they contribute to our national security and that expected to be hundreds, if not even thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So of course it's right to highlight that. '
It is not clear whether Trump came into contact with a helicopter as part of event the southern yard or not, but he sat behind the wheel of a car.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, poking fun at media outlets about the company's products in his personal aircraft park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - Through tears arrived at peace and joy
2011 Daegus in hit Šadeiko in the last area, an 800 m-run leg ramp, and the was taken away with stadium was with a beachfront.
Just before that, he had received zero in distance jumping from the universe held in China.
2012 Helsinki EM was marred by a low-cost injury, but at the debut Olympics in London, it gained 23 rd with 6013 points.
The misfortune, however, continued.
Moscow MM in 2013 received a thumb injury the opening day the Estonian record schedule.
Two years later, he won 15 th place on the Beijing MM and filled the Olympic storm, but that was disappointment for athlete than wanted more.
last year, Šadeiko passed the heaviest loss when he did not receive a letter result at first in the distance leap from Amsterdam EM.
I would just like to put together a proper multi-match once.
Once upon a time, "Shadeiko.
Worse was still to come: a month later, his Olympic qualifier in Rio was sealed at the first hurdle because of a record injury.
The time had to be taken down - did the seven-match at all?
Is two days' effort worth all that?
She thought long, but she found peace.
I got my head clean to think
It's relatively hard to describe this experience, but I've thought last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Luckily, there was time to heal yourself and think your head clean.
'I knew I didn't put the pills in the bag yet', Shadeiko talks about his self-cleaning.
I was able to turn a clean sheet and move on with a new momentum.
Coach Anne Nagorno said it was very difficult to look at the suffering of care, but she understood that the athlete in particular had to come to terms with himself.
After all, he was so botched by everyone.
It was hard to endure.
'The grit, however, said he doesn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth', says Mountain.
Now there is some peace in him.
He does it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the Götzis multi-match.
In a high-profile contest, he corrected the personal top-marquee in the bullet court by nearly a metre (13.89) and ran a record-breaking time in a barrier race.
Then the multi-racer felt that it was not a ceiling, but that only the primary competitive had been erased.
Nagorno, who coached him for years, says that Shadeiko is a black student.
He's a ready athlete, he's good to coach.
If something does trouble or is wrong, he says it immediately.
She knows her own body and trusts her cognition.
That is what we must do.
I cannot say exactly what needs to be done and we will follow it.
A new approach has also been found by Shadeiko.
'I am not the one who makes the maximum', he says, and he says that the most important thing is to to get the right sense, because it also ensures a good result.
Loved ones' baby bunch makes joyous
Good emotions have also been offered to Shadeiko by the good fortune of the loved ones.
Both her former training fellow Maris Nagorno and sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-racer has received support from new beauty citizens.
'It has been quite interesting', says Šadeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking equates to 'training' the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is very much such a big wine fan that believes - wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
In his words, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the 'very active' process of tasting wine.
By sniffing the glass, twisting the wine in the mouth, enjoying it and perceiving it as an aftertaste, we are putting our brains at work to create a taste for wine.
Sheperdi said the water molecules don't really contain tastes, but taste occurs in the way the wine stimulates the brain.
He brings in comparison how the brain "sees" colors.
"The taste is not in wine, the taste creates a wine flavor," says Sheperd.
The things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender and even the amount of spit that man produces.
Sheperd, of course, admonishes that wine is not in order to drink full.
"There must be more" in action, he says.
If you take too big a limp, the system is oversaturated.
Excess wine drinking can do harm to the brain instead of benefit - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine risk, memory loss, loss of of balance and reduced mental capacity.

Straw bags are a summer classic, which has become an own hitch product in recent years, and one of the right souvenirs has to hang out the hands, and to which traders, despite its its modest origins, have been able to add a price tag for.
A straw bag is probably one of the things that has existed once in on a perennial basis and has not caused much emotion to possess.

Now, though, beer bags are making a real winning move, and fashion fans have switched their subtle designer bags for summer months for simple straw-red bags instead.
It is not only a beach bag, but today it is also as popular as a street bag, and the courageous women even walk into the office.

However, the richness of the has made beer bags a true summer love for women.
For example, when reading foreign moeblogs, the first thing that stands out is that fashion brands raise the first thing on a holiday the local market as and acquire a few beer bags, which are then faithful to the whole holiday season and which accompany the beach, the market and also the girlfriends in the city cradles.
Some bloggers are downright so lavish that they buy a bigger bunch of bags from the market and sell or give away them to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting, however, that the demand for bags is so high among readers that women (and men!) in the real world would probably pass on each other a hug to become the happy owner of a few bags.

Admittedly, the apple coaching technique dates back to the 14 th century and is quite sarane with the usual reddings of corn.
However, beer bags do not have to be as strongly redacted as a basket, they can be combated with and other materials that make the bag more personal and more actractive.
For example, recently there are particularly trendy bags, with colourful panels or leather strips.
Above all, however, beer bags can be sent to Jane Birkin, the star of the of the biggest redacted had not been seen before.
Namely, she matched a beer bag to all kinds of clothing packages and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
The popularity of the bags nowadays does not play a smaller role, but is the case that caring for them is a head and, unlike all of other summers, they do not have to be cared for by special means, but it is also water and a wet towel.
As with the trendy trending initiatives, brands that have come out with all kinds of interpretations apart from the classical look.
For example, if you wish, you can acquire a or a tiny bag of.

Gmb worries about investment at company McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union is awaiting confirmation from the managers of cookie manufacturer McVitie's over long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
Gmb Scotland said the company has remained silent on the future of the Tollcross object investment.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
The company's McVitie's owner, Pladis, said they had invested more than £5 million over the past of years.
employees were hired, and union chairmen "are the first to hear" when something changes in factory activity.
In a letter to the company's object manager, GMB Scotland's company, McVitie, appealed "to address concerns that the facility will not be used to modernise production lines."
Gmb senior organiser Drew Duffy said: 'The fact that we are not getting clarity from the object's chief about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plan is deeply worrying our members.
Multi-generation families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow, being an indispensable mainstay for decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social weather shortages.
So, in terms of jobs, pay and well-being in the east of Glasgow and against a backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic depletion in production, a thriving yield business in McVitie's needs. '
A spokesman for Pladis said: 'The site manager of Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will respond directly to him as we value active communication with workers and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting was held in Tollcross between employees and representatives of the GMB, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: 'In recent years we have invested more than £5 m in the Tollcross site, most of it has gone to production lines and improvements to operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as an object of production, and if there should be any change in the activity of the object, the workers and the trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it. '
Did PSG warn Barcelona about their approach to Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won't give up on trying to lure Neymar into their ranks by making a £189 million bid to buy him out. but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record conquest trip?
This hardcore approach has opened the summer transfer window, and the Ligue 1 club are poised to crush more than double the clearance of the current world record set by Paul Pogba return to to Manchester United for £89 m last season.
Once the switch is completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, who will start receive more than £500,000 a week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona are, of course, outraged by both the manner of approach and breaking Neymar free, although a source close to Catalansi's board confirms that the club have always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs thinking about recruiting some of PSG's best players.
"I don't worry because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will stand up to them and make contact with those players," Al-Khelaifi said.
'We respect all clubs.
But if they are trying to a contract with some of our players, they have to face the consequences. '
Barcelona appear to have stepped over that limit as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG's midfield player Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
Psg made it clear that they would not let the Italian leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could face a setback as a result of that interest, losing one of their expensive assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit.
"Brexit seriously threatens to drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned on a first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.
'I can't imagine who would benefit from it', he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made possible the current free movement of people and goods, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders," he stressed.
Varadkari said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and because it is, remain part of the European single market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to streamline Britain's departure would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the UK, the Irish prime minister explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "Certainly we could have such a deal with Britain."
The alternative to this would be a return to the customs points that would herald historic division and political failure.
"A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace," the Irish prime minister said.
He called Brexit "a challenge for our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of daily life in Northern Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister met with leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when visiting Belfast.
