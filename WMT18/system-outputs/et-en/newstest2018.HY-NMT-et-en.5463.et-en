Four members of the Kemerovo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the Post, police in Spain detained the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group, Slava Gulevich, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevich, detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects detained in Estonia into custody.
The suspects are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal association, aged between 27 and 57, who mostly commit drug offences.
In Malaga province, Mijases, the alleged head of a criminal association was detained.
Three men were detained as suspects in Estonia, one of them being the lead figure of a criminal association, and two are members of a criminal association, according to the data collected.
The data collected indicate that tasks and roles were clearly distributed in the criminal community.
The purpose of the activities of the criminal association was to commit drug offences and thus earn criminal proceeds, "commented the head of the pre-trial proceedings of the criminal case, State Attorney General Vamir Verte.
"We do not rule out that the circle of suspects in this criminal case is increasing," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have also previously been caught up in the lobby of law enforcement authorities, and some have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed the importance of working with Spanish colleagues throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," commented prosecutor Verte.
The head of the Central Criminal Police Service, Ago Leis, said the arrests were preceded by a nearly one-and-a-half year preliminary investigation.
"In the first half of the week, a long period of work was realised and at the same time we held suspects in crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that central criminal police officers were assisting in detention in Spain.
For years, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can get them from another European side too, "Leis said.
The information collected so far points out unequivocally that men who have been held in detention can continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor's office requested their arrest and was also approved by the court.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting his surrender to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure the confiscation of this criminal case.
The pre-trial proceedings of the criminal case are conducted by the Office of Organised Crime of the Central Criminal Police and chaired by the Director of Public Prosecutions.
The city court in Tallinn convicted Slava Gulevich in 2005 of extortion and punishable her with a five-year jail term.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was regarded as the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after the then allianceman Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Kemerovost, rose to prominence in Estonia in the early 1990s when he began to deal with extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes at various hotels and demanded a monthly roof tax from businessmen.
International joint operations, seizures of criminal proceeds and rulings in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the last court decisions, eight defendants in the criminal case of the so-called Dikayev criminal association, who confiscated 80 000 euros in criminal proceeds in Eastern Europe, or the judgment against nine persons that Igor Aleynikov created in 2006.
The amount of the seized criminal proceeds is close to EUR 71 500.
In these criminal matters, the success of police officers exchanging information and evidence with their foreign counterparts on a daily basis and, if necessary, carrying out operations in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns of travel to Mississippi
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples (NAACP) has warned Missourians of traveling black people against discriminatory policies and policies.
The group's statement reads: 'the NAACP Travel Statement issued in Missouri State, which is valid until 28 August 2017, urges all African-Americans to be extremely careful when travelling throughout the country.
According to NAACP, the group urged the travel warning to be issued both by the recent Missouri law, which makes winning lawsuits on discrimination harder, and by the fact that the state's regulars are disproportionately targeted by minorities.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are drawn to the edge because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "NAACP's Missouri branch president Rod Chapel told The Kansas City Star.
"We have never received so many complaints before."
This is the first such warning issued by the US State.
The group cited events such as racist insults at the direction of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Sanderson from Tennessee.
Sanders died earlier this year in suspicious circumstances after he was caught driving a gasoline through the state and Missouri police took him into custody without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that in the state, cars of black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped than those of white people.
"The note is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and work associates about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared, then that means engaging in bail money or informing relatives that they are going through the state."
Based on the latest data from the FBI's hate crime notification program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, putting the state in 16th place in a row over similar violations.
The travel warning is also in response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for the company to sue for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Community (American Civiline Libertines Union ACLU) had issued earlier tour notices for Texas and Arizona after those states adopted immigration laws, according to local officials.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: what could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different -- A, B, C, D and E hepatitis viruses.
All these viruses call for acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, there is a chronic B and C hepatitis that can further develop into a liver cirrhosis, a liver wrinkle and liver cancer.
Health agency epidemiology adviser Kulo Kutsar says acute hepatitis disease is the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, spiking, nausea,
The last disease is also the popular name of liver inflammation with collateralization.
In children, hepatitis can run without disease.
Different types of liver inflammation can only be determined based on laboratory study data.
Acute hepatitis can overtake chronic hepatitis and run for decades without disease, meaning a person may know nothing about their dangerous liver damage disease.
Kulo Kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, by sending an infected person out of their hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects.
Family members and carers of sick people, people with chronic liver diseases, people with contraceptive sex, men having sex with men, men, people with mental illnesses.
It can be prevented by vaccinating, in particular by recommending vaccination for people travelling to and from A hepatitis C.
In addition, it is important for daily hygiene requirements to be met: wash or disinfect your hand, before consuming all fruit and vegetables.
B hepatitis viruses spread in contact with the blood of the sick person, injecting drugs, filling, augmentation, blood-contaminated cream (toothbrushes, contraception)
B hepatitis A risk group includes injecting drug users, infected person sex partners, men having sex with men, infected mother's newborn, sick family members and beavers, blood and others
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate those at risk, as well as those suffering from chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
B hepatitis for other prevention measures: preventing the use of hospice hygiene and manicure tools, other sharpened tools and needles in the event of sexual contraction, and
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunization plan in Estonia and free of charge for children.
Ule hepatitis viruses spread in contact with the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, filling, augmentation, use of blood contaminated with human blood, and hepatitis
C hepatitis A risk group includes injecting drug users, infected person sex partners, men having sex with men, infected mother's newborn, sick family members and carers with HIV, blood and others
The prevention of hepatitis C is: preventing the use of hospice hygiene and manicure tools, other sharpened tools, and needles, from infecting and infecting a dose.
There is no vaccine against C hepatitis.
D hepatitis causes D hepatitis A virus that reproduces in the presence of B hepatitis A virus.
Due to this, a D hepatitis infection occurs in combination with B hepatitis or superinfection in patients with chronic B hepatitis B.
D hepatitis viruses spread through exposure to blood and other body fluids, with them contaminated with needles, kinetic tea and rarely infected from mother to fetus.
D hepatitis Risks are chronic B hepatitis A virus carriers and people who do not have the immune response to B hepatitis B.
An effective preventative measure is vaccination with the B hepatitis vaccine, which also protects a person from being infected with the D hepatitis virus.
E hepatitis viruses spread through the fecal orange with drinking water and food, including low-heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, donor blood, commonly used syringe.
Passengers can become infected with E hepatitis high in the developing countries.
E hepatitis prevention measures are to meet hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after walking in the dough, before cooking and eating, after getting sick.
Fruits and vegetables wash before consumption, avoid eating low-heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and refrain from drug consumption.
While in the final round, competitors tried to print a four-time Olympic winner off the track, the 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won with a time of 26.49.51.
Farah did not think at length about pulling her husband Tania and the children on the track after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
Miss my family very much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful, "Farah told journalists.
Farah is aiming for London's fifth title race in a row between 5,000 and 10,000 feet of runway gold dubbed.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title dive Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Dam in gold. Gustav Klimt masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait of the 19th Century.
But even more deeply in history.
The attention paid to the information held by the honourable gentleman, or more curvaceous, would have allowed the title to have more influence in the extraordinary story.
At the moment, there are two books between some of them: the Gustav Klimt and his painting "Dam in gold" depicted Adele Bloch-Bauer's story and a much larger Jewish history book.
The first third of the book takes the cultural life of Vienna in the midst of a wedding, and who himself entered the Austrian capital, can hardly imagine how more than a hundred years ago life went to Ringstrasse or where Centrali
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and when you see the name of the book, you feel more like a grammar culture.
However, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where there was an incurable syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, as if nothing was added to the development of the story.
Or perhaps still - every parochial tweet also adds colors to the early 20th century cultural life in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten Vienna residents was Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married himself twice in the opening of the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and Klimt for his famous paintings.
But Adelett's whole glamorous life, to which he belonged, did not draw.
Looking at "Dami in gold," it is hard to believe that towards the end of life this genteel lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of travelling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his wife's portrait from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt's order cost £4,000 at the time, a quarter of the price of a well-located rural house.
That, for some portrait, the master's love story was suspected with modelled, the sugar magnate was not discouraged.
As far as Adelaide is concerned, the only certain fact is that the close relationship between the modelled on the work and the artist continued until the end of life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Dam in gold.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait of the extraordinary story, "Varrak 2016, English translated by Aldo Randland.
Just before the start of work with Adele, Klimt had visited Ravenna in San Vitale basilics, and investigators think that the brilliant mosaics of the Emperor Theorese
Klimt presented his "Dami in gold" in Vienna in 1908 and around the same time (between 1907-1908) was born in each other's golden painting "Streaky."
Art historians did not notice the similarity of the two women.
How is Hitler connected to the story?
"I think to remember my friend Klimt I owe him to make his hands available to the public," wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after the artist's departure (£18) Belveur in February
Six years before his death, Klimt had produced a portrait of Adele.
Also in her testament (Adele left in February 1925) she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscapes painting for the Austrian Gallery.
In her jewellery, she inherited her sisters Mariah and Luisi.
A year after Klimt had finished "Austria Mona Lisa," he had attempted to enter the Academy of Kaunte Arts in Vienna, but failed.
Although sometimes the reason for Hitler's subsequent anti-Semitism is that he was not accepted by Jewish professors to the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery, which was referred to in the Maria Theatre, had changed considerably by 1939-it was important to find magnificent works from the rich Jewish art collections of Vienna.
Hitler's personal artistic assets were also matched by some of Adele's work at home, but not those of Klimt.
Sixty years after the Nazi art tracks began a 10-year litigation between the Austrian government and the heirs of the Bloch-Blockers.
It should be noted at this point that, if "Snooty" is seen in the Belvedere castle in Vienna, the 'Dami gold' depicting Adele Bloch-Bauer must be seen to travel to New York.
And before the Vienna race read out the aforementioned book as well.
Even when you look at Klimt's works, you do not plan, because at least my emotions revolved around the painting and model of Bauer and Adele after the book was closed.
So not so much a portrait, but rather a fatality - and a very moving story.
Bauers' lineage was greatly facilitated by the orientation of events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In previous swimming, the Gold Coast's own 200 m wheel-swimming personal record was very close to swimming 2.16.62.
The top mark dates back to 17-year-olds a week ago, when the Canadian junior championship got to a time of 2.16.58, mediates the Prius on the Avalanche Ujumbo blog.
The Gold Coast escaped the final as perhaps a tenth of the A-League finals.
In the finals, he went ahead with a distance of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful top mark.
The Estonian record for Alina Kendziori (2.15pm) left the Gold Coast separated by just over half a second.
In Estonia's all-time ranking, Gold rose to third and his fresh personal top mark is the fifth result of Estonia's all-time record.
The young hope of the future is that the Canadian adult championship is still starting at 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestyle and 200 m- and 400 m.
The Canadian junior championship took place in Toronto last week, and the Gold Coast made successful starters there as well.
He won the 200 m freestyle silver medal with a time of 2.03.22.
This distance was last flooded so quickly by Estonians in 2008.
Only Estonia's record as Elina Partruka has sunk faster than ever before.
The champion, who lives in Canada, won the bronze medal in the 100m freestyle with an excellent personal record and the top mark of the new Estonian season at 56.66.
The elder Kertu Ly Alnek, for example, has sunk this distance just one century faster.
At the personal peak, he reached a further 100 m in the sliding swimming pool receiving a letter of 1.03.69 in the opening exchange.
In half the longer distance, he only gained seventh place when swam in the finals to 2.17.31.
The Gold Coast is currently leading the Estonian season ranking on four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen teeth
The holidays are over - that means relaxing to US President Donald Trump as well.
Since Trump, however, has been one of the most holiday days taken out by the president so far, shark critics are already teeth.
USA Today and CNN reported the president is planning a 17-day holiday to spend at an omanium-meal golf club in Bedminster, near New Jersey.
Although the president's holiday began yesterday, Trump's opponents on the holiday have been speaking out for a week.
They are casting Trump as too frequent to rest.
Namely, it is customary for the president to spend weekend time in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villas.
Incidentally, Trump has not been the most rested president in his 196 days in office.
For example, George W. Bush reached this time on vacation to be as early as 67 days, with Barack Obama, however, half less than Trump, in just 21 days.
But Trump does tend to sleep quickly.
Numbered days after becoming president, Trump said sending "60 minutes" to long vacations for his wife during the time will not stay because of the very much needed to be done.
It also issued an outcry over Barack Obama's holiday three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time: "while Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending festivities and jogging concerts, slapping ISIS journalists' heads from the loop."
According to the White House officials, the 17-day golf club visit was not a relaxation.
It is officially called a working holiday, during which Trump has no time for reading or other memories.
In addition, working holidays had to be another reason.
Namely, the White House's western-wing air conditioning system is being switched off and that is why all the staff had to leave.
The West wing also hosts the Oval Cabinet and other workplaces for the president.
"I do not think any of you would want to be in the West wing in August if there is 38 degrees and no air conditioning," White House spokesperson Lindsay Walters, who stressed during the holiday.
From where President Trump's subsequent 17 days spend, you get a clue from the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook do not run for state office unless you tolerate criticism from voters
Our country's father knew a lot about the unfavourable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but newspapers did not go long to start scolding him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism naturally irritated him.
But he did not force his critics to remain silent.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of expression can be taken away from us and, in a dumb and silent way, we can be chased to the massacres."
That brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work hard to be more Washington like that.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And towards the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberty Alliance (American Civilisations Unified ACLU) sued him accordingly.
The governor's office teemed the action into a blank and Web commentaries weathered counter-reactions in the style of "Keep interested?."
"It is just Facebook," many said.
But it matters though.
And that matters especially much when it comes to a man like Hogan.
The act is an astonishingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
His approval percentage is ranked second among the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not without thought of reacting to a tug head.
He has led the state on a firm footing and remained firm on his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook rather blissfully in communication with his constituents, presenting an example after chemotherapy first spotting his wedge on his head.
So the governor's page, which is a public forum with official labelling, is administered by blocking people visiting staff who receive taxpayers' dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's conduct in an interview with The Washington Post, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing but modeling.
But it is too easy to paint a picture of Internet trolleys driving the web, spammers or a crowd full of anger.
The Post interviewed several pretty people whom Hogan blocked.
And that is what they are pretty people communicating with their elected leaders. A teacher, company owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and by no means roaring.
The pastor quoted Bible in his post as opting for Hogan Catholicism.
The lawyer from Maryland Bowie, Lakshmi Sarma Raman, was not inciting anger but pretty about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in a commentary article for The Post's news story.
"Nor do I like the idea that, when a lot of people comment on the same subject, some immediately call it an indifferent collective effort, rather than acknowledging that it is an act of great concern to citizens."
What the governor's officials called a "targeted spam attack," others would presumably call "public support."
The Facebook era allows messages to be easily matched by simply blocking a critic or erasing negative comment.
It is much cleaner than the old one, when workers had to be sent out to do the same, to gather newspapers with critical instructions and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to remain silent.
But exactly that is what is happening now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for making Facebook and other social media bites.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have blocked him from Twitter streaming.
One of the first keynote judgments on the subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cachelis ruled in Alexandria that the chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the Constitution's first amendment when she blocked a voter from her Facebook page.
Kentucky also visited the ACLU on Facebook and Twitter for use by Governor Matt Bevin (R).
It should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, affordable mail costs had a similar effect than the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800 quadrupled the number of newspapers and anonymous writers typified his leadership.
And even then, Washington had to chest with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms like Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington's decisions landless.
According to historical documents picked up as part of an online George Washington collection project, he buried the cabinet amid petitions criticising his views on friendships, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he did not push them into silence.
Freedom of speech, dissent and debate are the mainstays of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronnie Rafferty hopes for comfort of home territory at Renaissance Club
Former European Championship champion Ronnie Rafferty is hoping for comfort in home territory over the next three days when the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf course takes place Jan. 25.
The Northern Irishman, who was driving the Archerfield Links on the runway in the last round before Paul Ealle's downfall last year, is fond of the new manager and will fill the club
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we see the club shining in full glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players see the track in their best form, it is in a brilliant state.
Jerry has done an excellent job building this place.
He is a keen supporter of the golf game and feels proud of what has been achieved here.
This will make it possible to present the trail perfectly. "
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending the championship for the first time, although the man has won both the European Tourist and the European Challenge Tournament in his 32-year career.
"It is going to be accompanied by a very special feeling," Southport's pesky player said.
"I could not defend my Extremadura Opening title because it was taken down a year after my victory in the competition calendar.
The magic is to come back into it.
It is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's win was special.
It was a very special time that we will always bear in our hearts. "
On home soil, Gary Orr will return to the competition again, joining the Seniors' European Tournament earlier this year when he got 50.
The act is his first event in Scotland since taking part in the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scott Openreach.
"To play at home is always a bit more meaningful," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to do well, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I have tremendously enjoyed playing again and shown a pretty decent golf game.
I am happy with what has happened so far. "
The trio will join the square with former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and the sevens star's champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the competition fire, the rest of them being Andrew Oldcorp, Stephen McAllister and Ross L.
Entrance is free and car parking costs one passenger a car £5 and a car with two or more passengers £10.
All proceeds will go to charity organisation Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold-plated countryside
When Bardina Degei prepares dinner, she does not use a pencil.
He even uses pot rarely.
In the wooden house in the capital of the Panai Province of Indonesia's troubled Papua province of Panai, Enarotan puts a housewife in a local language nota straight into the place of fire.
After half an hour, the embroidered mugul is taken from a fire and dragged with unwashed hands with eager skin.
Degei sits on the mud floor with furniture he does not have and, at the same time, does his daily housework, such as washing laundry with the water of hacking from a nearby sex.
The role of the toilet fills a bucket without a roof in the room.
Since she is the youngest of her husband's four women, she has not been appointed to look after any knee.
Polygamy is common here.
Late working, however, can be dangerous most of the village's men are unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are still soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
This is a rare glimpse into life in Papua mountains. It is a former Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum triggered by controversy, during which only 1026 old troops were ordered to vote.
Freed from Dutch supremacy, the movement towards its fury quickly stirred up against the Jakarta government, which still keeps the region under its strong control, keeping away foreign journalists and human rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into Papua and western Papua, so the independent Papua New Guinea remained the eastern part of the island.
The Enarotali is just as remote and abandoned. To get here, you have to fly 90 minutes from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nambura and then cross a naughty journey.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 residents consists of tree houses surrounded by bamboo fences and cover wavy iron roofs with rooftops transformed by different shades into collared boots.
Very few Indonesians have taken the journey here, let alone journalists, and almost no foreigners have visited here.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago bowed to a goat called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing such clothes," says Degei, referring to his colourful hand-woven turkey, dark plum and special skirt.
"Before that, we only wore plant leaves on the body."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28 per cent of people living below the poverty line, and statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are among Asia's worst.
But it is also Indonesia's gold-plated land.
Just 100 km from Panama, a mountainous province of about 153 000 residents of New Jersey, is located in the world's largest and most profitable gold mine in Grasberg, which is owned by Phoenixport.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted about USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua can be bothered with consumer timber stocks, worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are the source of the suffering of the boats as they result in the stifling presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times found that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The boats' attempts to ensure greater autonomy threaten to turn this golden hue and go ruthlessly around.
More than 500,000 boats have been killed since 1969, according to human rights activists, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killing of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
More than 390,000 peaceful protesters were arrested by Indonesian police in the area last year alone.
The 2016 report of the Archbishop of Birsbank "We are losing everything" contains testimony to atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (rape and electrocution, according to another report).
"It is hard to count the number of victims because such incidents occur every week," says the organisation Human Rights Watch Indonesia investigator Andrew Harsono.
The screams have yet to be more strongly shut because Papua's natural resources have caused an influx of newsagents from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but demographics are changing as black economic migrants arrive from the Indonesian nations of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Suulawes.
The jalapenos' family dining rooms sell kangaroo and mixed-vegetable gadgets, served with peanut butter.
Locals cannot compete with them.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables more cheaply in the traditional market from local boats," explains Paniasis born 24-year-old Abeth You, who moved to the provincial capital for work.
"Indigenous boomers in the boardroom mammoth [women] are therefore losing their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known among the nation as Jokowi, pledged in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights abuses in Papua.
The former Treasurer won on his way to the Jakarta presidential palace in Papua 29 constituencies of 27, including Panai.
But Pappas has very little changed and locals feel pegged.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in anticipation that he will fulfill our hopes in terms of restoring justice," You says.
In fact, Panai languished just two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang in an Enarotas parked at a Christmas table when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle from the darkness.
The affidavit's children told them they should turn off the front lights.
According to the story of local pastor Yavedt Tejab, one of the soldiers sounded their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and spectators, drunken soldiers dragged the children behind them and beat them with their rifle handles.
One of the soldiers then shot at the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeo, was beaten so brutally that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, a nearby Election Commission building was set on fire and the next day things escalated further.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered to demand justice at a football field in front of a local police station and a military command centre.
They wore ceremonial hunting boots and presented the Papago tribe with a waitress dancing, during which they ran around and mattered a bird song.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police and military.
If the population resists more than three times, let them down, "said the official document, seen by the magazine TIME.
The elder Yeremias Kayama (56), of the town of Kego Koto, felt threatened and called for calm, asking the crowd to go home.
No one was willing to listen.
"Turning around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he told the magazine TIME in his erratic colors at the woodhouse veranda.
Kayama still does not know who the shooter was, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered.
"There was a lot of the crowd, the columnist abound," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times by a cousin who saw his shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was with him," said the magazine TIME gloomily in Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"Saw that he is dead... I rode him."
Papua police chief inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates were only providing security for his district since it was attacked.
"We need to protect ourselves when we are threatened to be killed," Phuket police spokeswoman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
News of the killings only reached Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Mr Jayawardene delivered a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the victims' families and promised to deal with the abuse in Papua.
"I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism to resolve human rights crimes committed.
But almost immediately excuses followed.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes, "he said.
Speaking to magazine TIME on 5 June in Jakarta, Wiranto, however, withdrew his words, saying he had no intention of creating a mechanism in Papua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, "everything will be settled by law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of human rights crimes in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said 11 human rights crimes had already been solved in Papua, including.
The families of Panai victims adopted such claims with grim disbelief.
"I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," Yohanes said.
"I am tired."
He says he still lives years later in fear.
"I am afraid," he says.
"I am afraid the army will arrest me, I am afraid I will be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that Panai people are afraid to lay the blame for the incident.
He said he received a beating from the army after he was helped bury four victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army came to look for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers at the neighboring Panai enclave in Deiyah.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when a gunbattle went on between villagers and a building manager who refused to transport an unconscious man to hospital.
This male crowd, 24-year-old Ravanus Douw, who drowned in a fish while trying to reach a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested at a construction site in front of the company's office.
According to police, villagers were throwing stones at police, on which the latter responded with warning shots.
But according to locals, a mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one person.
"We were in great panic, we were afraid of retaliation," said magazine TIME's 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and watched the injured from inside.
"I have beaten myself two days in my house."
Deiyai's parliament has called for the prosecution of the police involved and the police's mobile brigade to be pulled back from the area.
Panai has always been a problem place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development fueled the dissatisfaction of the honey, mommy, dans and Dami tribes living in Papua's hallowed central mountain county.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) army of rebels, which, according to themselves, protects the rights of the boats by occasionally organising attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the VPL's leads come from Panai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of "protecting the sovereignty of the state," the army has arrested Paniais over recent years and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some will never appear again.
Among the people of Papua, Phelps is known as the "tragic forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
The low rice sold in Enarotas is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is equally elusive.
People grow all their food themselves mostly in bathtub, in addition to a bit of fruits and lettuce.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom is able to care for four or five baby fields.
They usually keep most of the harvests for the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten baths only cost 10,000 Indonesian squares (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has deepened between the busy boats and the new migrants who have received a number of arrivals since the opening of the new airliners at Nabre airport.
Those few jobs that exist will go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua itself often lacks the capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Panai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, tough restrictions persist on foreign media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escuddie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua as "they did not follow relevant practices," although they had been granted a rare film licence.
According to Phelm Kine, deputy head of Human Rights Watch's Asia department, Jokowi's election promises have not been implemented to lift restrictions on reporters to promote transparency and development.
"Journalists trying to make an attempt in Indonesia from Papua's most eastern troubled provinces and western Papua face new threats of visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a media cage means international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Sared and Solomon Saared of the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "a wide range of crimes" in Papua, including the shooting
The same countries have also historically supported the VPL.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the grouping allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia still applies democratic order and freedom of the press, so evidence of human rights cases" would be difficult.
Local people want more foreign governments to take notice.
When the Dutch official delegation headed by the country's human rights envoy, Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people interrupted the meeting but, according to the source who wanted to remain anonymous, "we urge freedom."
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the U.S. does not believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Panai shooting," says the tribal council chairman, Hobai.
He wants to make sense to Jokowi that, in addition to the people of Panai constantly living under threat from the predatory army, they are languishing in misery because of the so-called education and health services.
Gobai said Panai people, like other boomers, must have their voices given to Jokowi for the debt he is charged.
"They do not need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the Panai shooting victims were able to cope with the latest symbolic insurgency they buried one of the victims' dead bodies at a police station and the military base on the land.
Knowing that justice may never be put on its feet, they at least will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with a lowered head.
"What else could we do?"
Fire engulfed Dubai Torch's eye-watering self for second time
The fire fed through one of the world's most high-profile residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee it at 337 feet and a 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that has ravaged the Highway in just two years, called the case Torch, or the Ring Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of the fire was filed.
"We slept and woke up to the fire alarms and screaming people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "a resident who called himself George told Reuters.
According to Dubai Civil Guard officials, firefighters extinguished the blaze at about 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter to those affected.
The incident could again raise questions around the world about the safety of high-pitched materials used on foreign soil.
An investigation conducted in the wake of the Torch board's 2015 fire found that most of the damage was suffered by façades - foreign surface decorative panels and insulation.
Britain's police have said they believe London's Grenfell Tower isolation and façade panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire there in June, in which around 80 people died.
Watch: these phones apparently get sales hits in the fall
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for technical fans, as phone makers then unveil their new top models.
Spring came on sale at the Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia's XZ Premium, also in the fall, are expected to pop up new hi-fi phones.
According to the Tele2 marketing and sales director Kristjan Seema, the modern flagship features an innovative design, an excellent slender, a server with 4K resolution display and a superfast processor.
The great excitement was generated by Samsung's Galaxy S8, which has also reached the front of the Estonian smartphone sales table.
Autumn promises even more outdoor fast charging for smartphones, a more robust battery, a more high-quality camera and greater water and dust security.
He added that, on the basis of rumors, assumptions can already be made and predicted four top models that will presumably capture the sales details of today.
These four top models of smartphones will still reach the poles in the fall of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach pools as early as mid-September.
Rumours of what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it are spreading a lot.
If the iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences to the iPhone 6s next door, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to make the new model completely different from previous ones.
There has been talk of four colours: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is apparently a screen that covers the entire phone's front panel, lost on the home bump and a fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple design manager JonyIve insists the new iPhone model looks like a smooth glass.
There has also been talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
As well as an iris spinner, wiring free loading and a more high-quality camera can expect a faster A11 processor.
Certainly it is one of the year's most anticipated smartphones.
The pre-order of the brand new model Galaxy Note 8 starts on August 23.
There are, though, many rumors of what new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
Reportedly more is meant for the business user and S Pen allows even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wavelength and another with a narrower view of the television lens.
No one knows yet what two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case it is Samsung's first test, which is certainly comparable to the iPhone 8 in quality.
However, we are looking forward to 23 August.
Although Nokia has brought three smartphones up for sale this year at the head of Nokia 6, there is still a lack of their flagship - Nokia 8, which will be presented as early as August 16.
We look forward to Nokia's 5.3-inch screen and ultrafast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and more robust battery.
Nokia also talks about the aluminium corps and the significant level of water and dust resistance in IP68.
Similar to Samsungi, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras, with optics produced by company Zeiss.
While Sony's firm flagship has been in the XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future, with even more innovative features.
We expect a smartphone that is a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least as good or better with a camera.
Sony's new model has been speculated that its display will be at least six-story.
What reality brings, we can already see the right head, because traditionally Sony has unveiled its autumn flagship International Technology Fair, which will be held this year from 1 to 6 September.
According to leak transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico on payment of border wall
The Washington Post disclosed transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian state leaders.
On January 27, Trump went on a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop the latest public proclamation that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president fractured with him the wall for public condemnation, saying, "You must not tell this to the press."
Trump erected his presidential campaign on a pledge to build a wall on the United States' southern border and an oath to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also were published revealing the tense exchanges.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal under which the United States would take on refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous," "nervous" and "foolish" he claimed the government's resettlement deal was made.
Trump ended the speech by announcing to Turnbull that "it was the day's most unpleasant speech."
The Supreme Court did not discuss the complaint of the OÜ MRP Links in a case in which the city of Tartu rejected their tender for the procurement of bus transport between July 2019 and 2029.
It is a handshake that rejected the offer by OÜ MSRP Linn Lines to buy the Tartu bus because the tender did not meet the requirements, said Anfour Aputin, Director of the Tartu City Law Service.
This is the procurement of public transport within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MSRP Linda Lines sued the Supreme Court over the Tartu district court's ruling.
The Supreme Court did not take it.
While on social media many complain that the noisy noises from the Weekend festival disturb their nightmare and the whole city is full of drunken festivals, there are many who do not have any bad words about the festival.
I am even positively surprised that the shops were so polite!
I did not see any hacking or impropriety.
Even the kindness I saw, "speechless Laine said.
"It is all very well to be flooded, to be and to be delighted with the Pärnu, which has remained like a winter dream," he jokingly adds.
The sleeping rough on the beach does not bother.
While living in the city centre, he still heard music playing on the beach, the music has not yet reached his home.
"But I hope to hear," he says jokingly.
Agnes, who spoke with the air, also says that the Grand Festival is rather good for Pärnu - it makes a significant contribution to the work of local merchants.
In addition, he rejoices that so many expatriates have come to visit the summer capital.
A woman with no pelvic memory cannot be tied.
Although I am no longer sunbathing on the beach, it is nice that the beach has revived.
And it is great that the crowd is moving and that has already been the case three times, "the woman says.
On the first occasion, I think it was a little worse.
"Then maybe there were complaints," he ponders.
However, the meal on the beach is, he says, common for the summer capitals.
"This Weekend is a very good promo to our small town," speaks the park's scalable Hariri.
The memory and möll have not beaten his life rhythm.
But for what?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this interstate would be better.
The man of loud music does not muse.
It does not matter, although I live near it.
"Good people can hold together and there is no malice," he talks.
The guests who came to Pincus are polite, he says.
"With bottles, of course, they have exaggerated a little too, but young people are young and daddy god - let's go, but be human and we can handle it!" He says.
Coastal residents have traveled somewhere by then, either to relatives or to acquaintances.
"But generally, the festival affects life positively -people like this kind of meme," says Pincus of the children walking to Tiina.
His family's sleep in festival-music is also not bothered, even though last year the industry went even further than that.
Last summer, the lava was second, then we heard more.
We live outside the city in order to actually get there far along the Pärnu river, "he says.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to revive business
British education company Pearson said Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent, thereby launching another restructuring programme to tackle the business's threatening squeeze.
Losing jobs, which will be made redundant, according to chief executive John Fallon, is highly likely in late 2018 and early 2019, adding to the 4,000 positions lost in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced plans in May to cut costs by another £300 million (394 million US dollars) as part of a third cost reduction programme to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid switch to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell a stake in Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann last month, said their expectation for a year in connection with the sale had not changed in the first half of the year.
Summer warm weather continues Sunday with rains

At night, there is a cloud of weather in Estonia.
There could be a thunderstorm in several quarters.
Southwest and western wind gusts of 5-11, blasted up to 14, on islands and on the coast up to 18 m/s.
The air temperature is 13-17 degrees.
The days come with alternate cloud weather.
On several sides of the rains, a layout is possible with a thunderstorm.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked an army convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, according to officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, the NATO statement said.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident on the city's Qarabagh track.
That bombing is the latest in a series of violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people died in a mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber in Kabul killed two people near the Iraqi embassy.
A NATO statement said Thursday evening's explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan Army was attacked "a person inscribed with a self-made explosives device."
The statement said all were injured in stable condition and are being treated at a US military hospital at Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents say the Taliban and the group, known as the Islamic State (ISIS), are a growing force in Qarabagh for NATO forces in Bagram.
At least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, according to the United Nations, about 20 percent of them in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people on a mostly Shiite track.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bomb attack in the center killed more than 150 people - the most deaths brought by a military offensive in the country since US-led troops retook power from the Taliban in 2001.
That violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of US troops helping the country's army and police.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA annulled decision to delay suitor regulation after sharks
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (Unified State Environmental Protection Agency) annulled its decision to delay the Obama-mandated regulation obliging states to limit emissions to 15 days after the complainant.
The EPA announced the decision to proceed with "operations to determine the 2015 ozone content" late Wednesday, saying it shows the agency's commitment to working with the states.
"We believe we need to engage in dialogue with our state partners and listen to them," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to postpone the definition of ozone in different parts of the country to measure air pollution by one year in order to meet the latest air quality standard.
15 mostly Democratic states filed lawsuits with the Columbia district on Tuesday, saying the ruling was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has been trying to pull back a series of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama, Trump said it is part of a broader plan to boost growth.
But those aspirations have provoked counter-reactions among Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the impact of increased pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhalation of the air containing ozone "can impair the ability of the lung to work and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases," such as asthma.
German pigs can come to a celebration.
German pigs and cattle could come to a celebration as heavy rains threaten the yield of the European Union's second largest wheat producer, Bloomberg writes.
This year, it may be the case that the weeks of saucepan before the harvest could mean that fruit intended for the bread industry is only suitable for animal feed.
"The quality of wheat is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015," said Agravis Raiffeisen analyst Bernhard Cahilla.
This year up to 40 per cent of German wheat for animal feed, double the usual rate, was forecast in Agravis.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all weather this year.
First of all, winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June replaced the heatwave.
In July, Germany was hit by a spike, which has continued into August.
Many eyes are turned on northern Germany, where rain prevents dining.
So far, only five per cent of wheat has been harvested.
The majority of the area has not yet started harvesting, announced by local producer Ceravis.
"There are pretty challenging days at hand," said Ceravis senior trader Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Consistency in everything, or in Finn's interior design,
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of Messiah homes, as through large windows, the unparalleled views of the Sami shores reach many (life) rooms.
At every turn, our northern neighbours are turning a blind eye to the quest for both tough and perfect (energy-saving) homes.
Admiration, as well as compliance, is worthy of Finn's wood-use ability in building and finishing materials, furniture and beauty making.
Exploratory techniques and smart solutions can be found in the houses of a builder and (home) designer.
It has to be clearly pointed out that the composition of black, white and grey shades, if complemented by wood shades and toast plants, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be notched up for a week, as the honey runs until 13 August.
Accessories and herbal pots hint that cocoa in this kitchen often.
On the night against today, the line was drawn down to the street at the Weekend Festival in Baltimore, and Martin Garrix gave the main stage all to remember as the last performer.
The crowd was truly turning around during Garrix's appearance - singing, huddled, dancing enthusiast.
When Garrix stopped, a common masse of Pärnu beach was dispersed onto the city.
We bring to you a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer tried for three days at the Weekend.
Surely you are also some of them, looking up!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are expected to be on a collision course to go face the near future in the most cough boxing match up to 66.7kg in weight category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in the ESPN office in Los Angeles in separate rooms until Garcia, the unbeatable World Boxing Councilman's lightweight Champion, strode into the corridor for another
After Garcia's unanimous decision resulted in victory over former four-time World Championship champion Adrien BRONERI on Saturday in Showtime, both contenders will feature in the Premiership table.
Garcia extended his better hand and said, "How do you go, the Champion?
I wish you success. "
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 019 ESPN.
When the couple posted for the photos, Lomachenko's mountain jet Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between the militants would be "the perfect yardstick."
"I am a former Suleman," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up [to 63.5 kg] for BRONERI, but I am not that big.
I am 63.5 kg per small.
I want to move below the light weight.
And he has to move upward with light weight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fans have wanted it.
Let us offer them that. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Klimas also raised the question of whether it should be worth looking at. It is part of his strategy to allow Lomachenkol to debit 61.2 kg in class after winning on September 23.
"Watching this fight could be rewarding as fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said later, saying he is open to fighting any channel offering the best financial package.
"We are the key players.
No other name can attract so much attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a "mighty champion" and could go to watch his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was humble in praising Garcia, saying that in his mind, the master of the three divisions from Riverside saw out "very slow; sorry Mikey... you wanted it notched."
Garcia said the goal was to show scoring strength and then boxing.
Both confirmed that they were feeling the tension growing between them.
"It is a struggle waiting to be realised.
No other confrontation generates so much attention and buzz.
I am more than willing to work for it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I have been on the waiting list for the best fighters and Mikey has just that.
It will be a good fight. "
What kind of world curators are moved to Estonia?
The soil was extended and the Police and Border Agency (PPA) issued a record number of more than 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
If, for example, the term residence permit was decided to be issued to 6702 foreigners, this figure was 4928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually stay in Estonia permanently, but such an analysis will be compiled at the Interior Ministry.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ago, in recent years this figure is set to close to 2000.
The number of people applying for residence increased by a springboard during the Ukrainian crisis - 1087 people received fixed-term residence permits in 2014, up from 675 a year earlier.
According to the Statistical Office, the highest number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens more than left Estonia.
"The Ukrainian community has been great in Estonia all the time, and because of the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural for work and learning opportunities to be sought from a country where the community and many families are already ahead," said Interior Ministry spokeswoman Kristin Rammus.
The memory and the memory of the Ukrainian people, who had a fixed-term residence permit, were even greater than the number of Russian citizens, although in 10 years the total number of fixed-term residence permits has been issued to the latter.
When the Ukrainians come here to work predominantly, the citizens of Russia are concerned about family migration.
"Given the historical Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the highest family ties with people living in Russia," said Internal Defense Academy's Migration Fellow Helena Maasing.
"If you look at where Russian citizens of Estonian residence have moved to, then after Harjumaa there is immediately East Virua," he added, and pointed out that around 40% of them have married a European Union citizen.
The soil was granted a temporary residence permit for 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit decreased.
"The leap is due to the fact that, instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for permanent residence in Estonia," explained Interior Ministry spokeswoman Rammus, who says the interest of Russian citizens in Estonian residence has remained stable for years.
For permanent residence in Estonia, foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply from the previous year.
It is intended to encourage the retention of people who have adapted.
However, a long-term resident's residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residency permit has also obviously decreased for the sake of the new residence.
For example, the soil was granted such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
The Ukrainians can now exchange their work, and the Estonian state will no longer tip on whether the pay criterion has been met.
This residence card became popular - applicants to the soil still have gray passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 people were allowed to live in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
This year, the total number of such applicants has already reached 1269.
In 10 years, Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence.
When three residency permits were issued for Nigerians in 2007, the Museum 200 was released.
We come from Nigeria to study here.
Estonian colleges are still popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of Indian, Bangladeshi and Nigerian citizens has risen largely thanks to student migration.
For them, too, the rule is that where the community has been created, it is easier for others, "Rammus added.
In 10 years, two people have moved to Estonia from North Korea, for example, the same number from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6,000 third-country nationals receive residence permits a year, that is about 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even if one considers more citizens of the European Union, migration remains about one per cent, "said Maasing.
In total, 14,822 people migrated to Estonia, according to the statistics office, out of 13,792.
That means immigration overcame a second year of emigration.
Most of the expatriates and losers are Estonian citizens, but more are among the outgoing.
As a result, the migratory life of Estonian citizens was in minus 2000.
Estonians migrate primarily between Finland and Estonia.
Mammal Couture's Prince Harry charms with sauces, titans and sculptures
The bottomless design, however, is history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream somewhere in the museum for hours and admire old sleeves.
If you do something with a chore then you study and learn more about it every day.
It is a joy of discovery!
Mammal Couture's glamorous world may seem like a living stranger to some, but the designer does not think so.
You yourself decide how much shine your life has!
I have a girlfriend who has a healthy sauna full of my created haute couture dresses.
Because it is not his fault that he does not live in Hollywood and does not go on the red carpet every day, he also wants to wear and wear these most beautiful dresses!
You get yourself to live your life special!
The fashion designer does not acknowledge the gap between the bright events and the grey day of everyday life.
It was this reasoning that led to a rolling plan to bring high fashion in Estonia into the countryside, between forests and fields, to people, the fashion often does not reach.
The Mammal Collection was presented as an example of Võrus, Jardine and Pärnu fashion alley, where 45 modeled royal defibrillators filled the entire street.
There is often a hangover in Tallinn, a nod in dignity, but there is more emotion elsewhere - shouting Bravo, standing up, wanting to thank you.
Much of the audience came to be equally newsworthy, but now they are fans of Mammal Couture.
If you exceed people's expectations, they are enthralled!
And I like that feeling of being in my own fashion as if I were in summer culture.
We had 50 feet of red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, it seemed they were not coming to an end!
Maria also does not recognise the fashion practice that creations must be presented to the supermodel, she willingly brings ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own customers to the stage - they have always come with joy.
It is, after all, so layers of experience, you can shine on stage in a wonderful shade!
I am so sorry that I have never seen my performance, I am always behind the shelf to give the last straw to things as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve would not allow me to watch calmly from the floor.
Maria is the sort of fashion filmmaker who does not just want to play a representative role, but was in everything.
I have a studios on my sewing machine, most of the collection I perform myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, you discover.
I am never far from my creation and I am not afraid to work.
The design thing is not limited, either, to stylistics, logistics, organising, organizing - everything has to pick up one of the temperamental women's days.
For those hours of work, the fanatics still have an enormous amount to do.
I cannot say when my working day will end, for me it is just a day full of joy!
I am still very lucky - it is like an incessant chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and still turn compliments.
Many times it is said that there is magic in my dresses - they make you feel printable.
The abundant typewriter lines that made Maria's debut famously overnight have the Mammal Couture signals remaining unbeaten.
Martin Mührsepp U18 boys: Estonians' underdog tournament weapon turned against us now
Sorry, the fairy tale ran out.
The first thing was that we could not catch our laugh.
And when there is such a big difference in the table, there is nothing to do, "commented the Estonian U18 basketball boys at 61: 75 on the Great Britain our only NBAs played basketball, BC Martin Kalev
Opponents took 28 balls from the offensive line and got so many more attacks because of it.
We were also not prepared for their aggressive defense or attack, it created.
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we could not build defense.
In defence, however, they were able to hold hands everywhere, we could not combine.
It created a team of legs from the bottom.
Opponents' homework was better done.
According to the Mürsepa, Estonia would have to make more tactical errors in order to withdraw its opponents' momentum.
In the last quarter - we had zero error, but opponents already got several quick baskets.
The atlety and tight insistence that was the underdog of the tournament with our weapon now turned everything against us.
Today we had no force against their aggressiveness.
The myriad remained calm with his caretaker in Kalamazoo, Matthias Tass.
In the tournament generally, good words can be said about the whole team, the single kicking spotter was present to this day.
It is a pity that this aggressive opponent has already met before.
The cup has been confident all along and played today with his looks but it seemed he was tired - he has been wearing a pretty heavy burden.
But he made a beautiful move that I have seen in previous trenches, "the instructor added.
Horrible numbers: the NCAA basketball team threw fewer than 10 points in the NCAA tournament with three quarters...
In the U18 age class, it is not just the young men's EMI B-Division basketball tournament in Tallinn, the maids started yesterday in Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland was, unfortunately, tied to the field of antirecords.
Estonia lost 25: 65, but after the third quarter, the situation was 9: 49, in the last ten minutes, the opponents took a leg from the gas pedal and the period was 16: 16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia threw 4, third with 1 point...
In doing so, the Estonians first hit two pieces in the first two minutes of the first throw, then 25 pieces of the game, then one in the skull and then another 21.
Perhaps within nearly half an hour, 47 of the throw line was caught one.
In addition, 2 points came from four free throws.
Ball losses were a reasonable number this time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had 33 points and Estonia 13% (68/9).
Estonia have started with two losses, with Portugal 83: 56 on opening day.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to upgrade supplies
Today, NATO's 1st permanent anti-mining group arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit to complement ship stockpiles and prepare for pre-existing exercises.
During the visit, the vessels are preparing to return to the sea, while giving crew members the opportunity to take a few days off.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to conduct a series of exercises and be ready for future historical explosives search operations.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the operational training carried out by them in the local waters well reflects our integration with the allied forces," said the Chief Operating and Planning Administration of the Navy Navy.
From 29 June, NATO will lead the 1st permanent mine management group from the Latvian navy Captenant Gvido Laudups, who took over the group chief of staff at the ceremony held in Riga.
The group's flagship vessel is the Latvian naval support ship LVNS Virsatis, which also operates the group's flagship stamp.
This half-year, the Estonian navy mini-hunter Sakaala belongs to the international unit.
As one of the four ships under NATO's naval command, NATO's 1st submarine group is a preparedness unit belonging to the primary rapid reaction force, which the Alliance can send to various parts of the world within five days.
4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become the place for the Birgitta Festival, launched 13 years ago by the Maestro Eri Kors.
This year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to the artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic.
The 'Traviata' and 'Tosca', which is also the 'Bolero', are not even included in the international production of the Birds.
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatrical discoveries.
It is bigger than any music theatre in its usual form.
It is a festival whose fascination takes power and never really disappears again.
Because the experience that a listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes human souls sound and touches on human perceptions in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Did Maestro Eri Klass's shoes not seem a bit great?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klass, it has been a lot of help.
He directed me through a whole of my student career and also supported a dieting career at the beginning.
Perhaps it is thanks to that that that I find it easier for him to keep working.
Different Klas has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it all spills over to me.
Excellent was to join a team that knows how things are going exactly.
It was the great heart of Eri Klass that gave me the strength to go well with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am now and I can handle it!
What could audiences at this year's festival agitate what special offer you?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, surprisingly, the first ballet written to the narrative of Astrid Lindgren.
For this, "Karlsson flies."
And one of the notorious nuances of this is that its ballet author is the Latvian composer, Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write this work.
Apparently he already has a Karlsson carpenter living in the soul of a child.
Risto, how do you jacket it all?
Thanks to my supportive life mate, definitely.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love and that is what I have, thankfully, with a couch.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend so much on other people, as far as I am concerned, or how I go to every new day.
And such a conscious holding of tone, keeping positive and actually smiling for yourself in the mirror in the mornings, significantly raised my percentage of happiness.
Especially now this week, when the most important rehearsals are on, I have practised it particularly agonisingly and it works.
To yourself, smiling activates the brain and raises the tone.
It is not just a buzzword.
I think people do not yet know half the things about their body that the universe offers them, but they are slowly discovering it.
Immediately, an important moment has come.
Have you also some ritual before entering the conductor's pulse?
There are still clothes to be exchanged for more comfortable ones.
It is this little moment for yourself.
But, generally, yes, I do not have the opportunity to rest or make a small sleep before the big event.
In fact, I even like to interact actively with people, even before entering the dirigendive.
But come to the Birgitta Festival, here is what to discover about not a particularly great opera and ballet friend too!
Watch the sensational video with Risto Joshua!
Published new results of age assessment tests for Swedish asylum-seekers
In Sweden, the latest results show that more than 80% of those tested were rated older than 18, but not all believe in accuracy.
Sweden's National Institute of Judiciary Medicine (RättsMedicinalvertek) began testing for the first half of this year.
The tests were set up for a more accurate assessment of age during the application process after the Swedish Migratory Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of several supposedly juvenile refugees.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 1,680 cases to the testing, and the Institute of Judicial Medicine has issued a total of 2481 test results between mid-March 2017 and July 31.
Eighty percent (2002) were rated as 18-year-olds or older and, in another 25 cases, the Institute of Judicial Medicine estimated that the testing "could be 18-years-old or older."
The 432 cases concluded that the person was "probably younger than 18."
Tests are only used if a person's age is under question mark.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Legal Medicine, the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
"We do not see a big difference compared to the statistics of previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Locals.
That much of the cases were rated older than 18 does not necessarily mean asylum-seekers have lied about their age.
The institute issued 581 test results in May and said that in 442 cases "there are indications that the person being investigated is 18-years-old or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of their 581 tests, it emerged that in 243 cases a person had directly claimed to receive 18 this year.
This medical-age assessment method, whereby wiser X-ray images and knee joints are analysed by dentists and radiologists.
One of the skeptics is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose duties include assessing human biological maturity to determine whether they passed through puberty sooner or later.
"I have had reason to think about it and I do not think the measurement method currently used should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say for sure, then we should not make the face that we can, "he told the newspaper Metro.
But Johan Göransson of the Institute of Success Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "generally, it can be said that the risk of child inaccurately dissolving into adulthood is small.
The highest, or about 10%, is the risk if a person is a little under 18. "

20-year-old left-armer Anna Maria Orel made a fine debut on the London Mile, gaining a fine 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was Mi's youngest female recipient, and a cheerful woman confirmed she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The contest went well and got a good experience.
In the first attempt (64.80) I immediately took my average result away, in the second (62.80) I risked too much and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear, "Orel said after the race.
I was looking for my cast and I am very happy I found it.

Orel confirmed that he was satisfied with the debut of Mi and was still waiting for many good matches: "I came here this year with the 32nd result, I finished 18th.
It is a very decent result.
I am 20-year-old and Mmile - that is the only one that matters.

West Virginia governor announced partisan exchange
West Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Rice announced at a rally Thursday night with President Trump that he would switch parties.
"Memorable it or not, but Democrats were walking away from me," Governor Justin Bieber said.
"Today I tell you, having prayed and thought for many... today I will tell you, the West Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
Cheers erupted at the gathering.
"So I am going to become a Republican tomorrow," Justin Bieber added.
"As a coach I would tell you it is time to play another game."
Trump had promised a major announcement earlier at the West Virginia gathering.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice Sanders did not support Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice Scalia, who is the state's only billionaire, according to Forbes.com, turned out to be elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and the coal business inherited him from his father.

Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued an announcement Thursday night that "governor Justin Bieber's partisan exchange is another blow to the Democratic Party that would rather prevent the state from getting better again." Than working on it.
"Just 15 governors and control the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice McConnell's announcement is simply the most recent wake-up call to the party, which is searching for a positive end to the run
It is no surprise that where there are many people, there are many injured.
Urmet, who is in the office of the Weekend medical television, told the Apprentice yesterday that the patches have had to be distributed pretty much.
Fruits and marshals are basic, out of sultry and light drops.
Also, of course, are head, backpack and shoes.
Urmetti says visitors come to the festival with false shoes and so the problems come.
Medics have also had to assist visitors with the couple's greater injuries - there have been some panic stories as well as one foot break.
We have also done seatbelts when a person has broken a hand or a finger.
Smaller seatbelts do away here, bigger we send to the hospital.

Coe praised Russians' honest apology over doping scandal
Athletics international Nineman Sebastian Coe praised, according to his words, "Russia's honest apology" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that this is not the time to allow the country back to sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, a Russian athlete at the IAAF congress on the eve of the athletics world championships, said that the ban on competition imposed on his country was right and firm.
He apologised to "all athletics players who have been snapped up by gold and silver medals in the competition."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to lift the antitrust ban imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"In my opinion today was a very honest response, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told journalists.
"The whole council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian sub-union itself admitted that they have had quite difficult times and are doing everything possible to restructure the alliance."
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its own reinstatement.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and there is progress, but Congress supports the group's proposal that this is not the time to withdraw Russia," Coe said.
"We have to do everything possible over the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want clean athletes to separate from the broken system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the IAAF's strict criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the athletics world championships in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF Group, said Monday that Russia was yet to meet several criteria for the prediction.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that doping control was still inadequate and coaches still operating freely.
The electric car revolution is making a significant difference to metal demand.
Who are the winners and losers?
Little that the electric car revolution will significantly change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say that from one place they win and another lose, smaller mining companies do not help.
Currently, Glencorp serves from coal and oil, but in the age of electric cars, cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel demand is growing.
This year, stakes in the spread of electric cars have been raised by decisions taken by the governments of the UK, France and Norway, which promise to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
The seismologist already knew Volvo was planning to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring a cheaper Model 3 electric car to market.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts, electric cars are already sold more than cars using petroleum fuels over two decades.
"In terms of some metals, it changes everything," said Capital Economics commodities analyst Simona Gambranini of Bloomberg.
We have already seen a huge impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has grown for years.
There are about three times more copper in electric cars than in a conventional car, reported Glencore.
More copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that it will increase copper demand by about five per cent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional lithium, cobalt, grafite and manganese demand.
Glencore will benefit from a growing trend in electric car prices and from being the world's largest cobalt producer, the Jefferies Group predicted.
This broker company estimates that the other winners of the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First-Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to the changing trend.
This year, 70 per cent have cobbled on the London Metal Exchange.
The bubble price increase was 37 percent.
Copper has also tumbled 14 percent this year, primarily due to economic growth.
Glencore's shares rose 20 per cent in London, having surpassed rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the side of the losers, the lead companies like Barclays Capital and Campine will have to adjust to the new era.
The main end use of lead is the starters of gasoline and diesel engines with the flow of batteries.
Electric cars use lithium batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless another purpose is found to overcome the fall in demand," said Bank of America Merrill Lynch metals market analyst Michael Widmer.
The lead price movement has not yet seen the impact of the loose trend.
The lead has ticked up 17 per cent this year, with it the best metal from price rises in London among the main industrial metals.
Investors see problems with metal as only a distant future.
"I am not sure the lead is that bad because cheap oil keeps conventional cars in competition," said metal-broker company Triland Metals sales manager Herwig Schmidt.
When lead demand falls, it is slowly happening.
It could be that way in about a decade.
For the time being, however, tougher emission standards mean that hybrid car demand, which is dependent on advanced pencil batteries during frequent engine launches, is valued by the international lead and the U.S. research organization.
Lightweight metals such as aluminium replace steel, as a lighter car can drive with less electricity further.
This explains the additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes for 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 per cent of the total production of aluminium in the world.
Probably that trend will deepen, Widmer said.
Aluminium has climbed 13 per cent this year as rising demand by automakers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers do not sleep.
AK Steele Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to manufacture light car chains.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter melted steel to withstand aluminium.
"Ultra-strong steel should be the answer to this development," said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of the oil era could also bring misery to the platinum.
It took about half that precious metal for diesel engines to catalyze cars, metal refiner Johnson Matthews reported.
"For many of the commodities currently in high demand like oil and platinum, there may not be much demand in the future," said Natixis commodities analyst Bernard Dahdah.
That does not mean raw materials as a whole are becoming less important, but their importance is changing in 15 years.
Platinum makers believe continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncorn CEO Marc Grynberg said that more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025.
Platinum manufacturers' big hope for a 10 year run is Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motosi developed hydrogen element cars that rely on platinum to produce hydrogen power.
So far, however, the technology has not yet commercialized itself.
"The diesel appears to be a clear loser on the way to electric cars," Exane told BNP's Paris Brunet.
German automakers suffered a major setback in July as a Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in the home town of Mercedes Benz and Porsche.
How football finance rules affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing rampant spending by European football clubs will not prevent Neymar's world-record transfer from Spanish football club Barcelona to French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from Uefa, the governing body that rules the European game and has the power to prohibit teams from attending the prestigious Champions League tournament, await Paris Saint-Germain only ahead.
The financial rules of the frantic game imposed by UEFA in 2011 (FFP) mean PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar's transition was funded without huge losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) alone to buy Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar's salary will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's transfer to the French club.
The PSG will undoubtedly be able to roll out such money to recruit Neymar and add to their star rotation, given that the team is funded by the family from Qatar's energy crisis.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out with those in the football business.
The FFA was set up by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed clubs falling into big debt in search of success are actually dealing with cheating and risking ruin should banks or owners quit supporting.
Since 2011, the FFP will focus on monitoring the clubs' debts instead of their losses.
The change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 at Chelsea - buying a club with potential and then making big spending to better the team and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
During the current three-year assessment period for FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs could carry losses of up to €30 million.
And despite Platini being disgraced from the presidential office in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to preventing overspending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules," Andrea Traverso, a FFP supervisor, told The Associated Press last week in Uefa.
Although PSG paid for Neymar's overpurchase clause as one of the holdout payments, they are able to distribute this amount for accounting purposes for the duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, making it possible to show a transfer fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG received the heaviest penalties on the neck of Manchester City, which owns Abu Dhabi.
The PSG was fined €60 million (at that point $82 million), which was subsequently reduced to €20 million, and the club was required to limit the Master League team to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to cajole over regulators by blowing their incomes up through companies linked to club owners.
Qatar's company may sponsor PSGs, but if the value of sponsorship is deemed to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to count as official income.
That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the Qatar Tourism Auto PSG support had been inflated.
There has been talk that a certain part of Neymar's PSG service could come through payments from Qatar through the organisation committee of the 2022 World Cup.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become a World Cup envoy, and claim UEFA regulators could easily expose such a manoeuvre.
Penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean UEFA is even more vigilant about any effort to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation told Reuters on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed Neymar's switch prematurely.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss PSG's situation.
The most recent reports show that PSG made more than $10 million in profit during the 2015-2016 season at a turnover of approximately 542.4 million euros.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been released.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will do well for sponsorship deals, merchandising and back-to-back sales.
The club expects to increase turnover by at least 30 per cent in connection with the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly exasperated by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to derail Neymar's transition by claiming PSG would breach the FFFA with it.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the country," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the PSG being primarily owned by Qatar.
Arsenal hooker Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's stance that the country funds the club.
"It is a consequence of property rights and it has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of the fair game, as the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a great player. "
Norwegian low-cost carrier Norwegian has a nice tradition of putting on a plane's lap pictures of those who have shifted boundaries in the field and been an inspiration to others, writes trip.com.
Along with the expansion of Norwegian's operating geography, a circle of people who deserved a seat on a plane has also expanded.
Among the selected perks are Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (screenwriter) and Miguel de Cervantes.
In the near future, however, one of the planes will begin to decorate the portrait of the legendary Queen's singer Freddie Mercury.
Today 50 years ago: a storm of hurricane proportions in Estonia that tore roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which raged on 6 and 7 August, caused major damage in particular to the West Bank, Harjuana and Ramadan.
North-west Estonia had wind speeds of more than 30 m/s during those days.
My old man ran from one carving tree to another in the garden and disappeared with his hands to support them.
Everything was dark and in rugby, like the World Cup.
The rear was already flying from the rooftops, reminiscent of the interview given to the magazine Estonian Nature in 2002 by Old Mother Linda Kurova.
Linda's husband saw her own planted garden collapse.
But what do you still support trees with your hands, where do you get against such a storm?
The sea came down the window, the windows were sprayed in the water, "Mrs Linda, who lived on the street in Haapsalu Kalda, said.
That the roads were strewn with trees and the roof of the railway station's perch had flown 20-30 feet long, Linda saw most of the hammering similar only the following morning.
According to locals, the trees behind Paralympa were in the ground, some completely pixel, some in half.
Everything looked very frustrating, the storm went from beautiful old trees to rugby and crack through like war.
West Virumaa did not suffer particularly badly in the August 1967 storm compared with western Estonia, but the damage was significant there, the Virumaa Journal wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Lossie Park and Paradise Park were swept from the ground, but our chicken parks were also heavily damaged.
In Tallinn, wind speeds were measured up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometres per hour.
On the Merifield in Tallinn, on the evening of 6 August, a small pencil shouted: "mother, mother!
Chickens are in the air and cannot get down anymore! "Wrote the Viral Journal.
The Põl Hills building in Viljandiland was so destroyed during the storm that it was decided to be demolished later.
The August storm did not have to be resisted by Türi's ski jump structures, which were later no longer restored.
The newspaper Red Hot wrote on August 12, 1967 that harvesting towns and settlements from landlocked trees and their branches is progressing slowly, and residents could get involved in clearing work.
Fertility fields were also heavily affected by the storm, and the newspaper reported that "party primary organizations must be both recession-driven and orchestrated."
Hurricanes can speak in case the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The bout wind record in Estonia persists from November 2, 1969, when Rushnul measured wind speeds of 48 m/s.
On Vaindloo Island, the meters were broken down, so strong wind speeds measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean beaches: nightly harvesting and poor beach weather
The colder summer weather also means a smaller harvesting effort in Tallinn's beaches.
"If there are weather, then people are on the beach, and if not, there are no people," says the beach harvester.
Skyscrapers scramble on the beach in northern Tallinn.
They are offered a melodic competition on low turnaround tractor that ploughs down the plains.
In fact, the last seven centimeters sift through the sand, picking out the sea debris and people's abandoned crosses: bottled corks, cigarette packs and so on.
People still come to the beach, regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If there is beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if not, there are no people, "says Alexander Usov, director of the Haldus beach cleaning works for the private company.
It is 6.30 p.m. and there is a bitter cleaning operation on the beach, because at eight the place must be fine for people.
Usov is on the job post at 4 a.m.
Apart from Stroom, he keeps an eye on the still Pirita, Lake Harku, Kawasaki and Palais on the beach.
Rubbish amounts have been cut.
Years ago it was a lot more.
People can now already assess what is done for them, "says Usov, who has been clearing beaches for 15 years.
Before, it was the case that when something new got upright, it was already broken the next day.
Now it is already being kept what the beach is.
Price of clean beach
One of the major works on Estonian beaches is the clearing of the sea debris that has been flown to shore.
For example, 400 000 tonnes must be transported on the beach in Pirita.
"It is an incredible amount," notes Usov.
The second major category is municipal rubbish, or all that people leave behind.
The semi-kilometre Strom beach bar has eight large rubbish containers needed to be emptied three times a week.
So much rubbish emerges.
However, colder summer weather has meant that the debris is a fifth less than it would otherwise be.
Third species form abandoned belongings.
For the most part, they are lastings.
As a saucepan, a dozen mudslides have been scooped out in the sand by Usov.
These remain owners waiting for the wooden path leading to the beach.
"Usually they come out more, but it is a normal harvest." Usov already knows that soon he will find them again in the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
Debris scattered
Erika Scholler, a spokesman for the Haberstown management services, concedes that the tractor's screening works are disrupted by locals.
The noise, which lasts from night to early morning, mixes the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
On the day, however, this work is impossible.
In one month, the beach comes twice through the screening.
"If we do not, the district will fine us," Scholler notes.
But the goal, like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu, is also to get the Stroom beach under the quality mark of the international swine flag.
"Compared with Europe, there is a lot more work in Estonia to have beaches cared for," Scholler says.
We have more adrons and stones and harder to sand.
But there is less rubbish on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Hearing the beach talk of debris, Martin, who lives near Stroom beach, unwittingly enters the conversation circle of a journalist and cleaning staff, highlighting the beach's current bottlenecks.
There is a picture of a balcony everywhere in the mornings.
The problem is with birds and bottlers who have pulled bags of rubbish, "Martin reports.
While it is hard to expect people to be able to change their behaviour up to now, Martin hopes that the city government will take action with the bin bins and put them onto the canines, for example, to prevent the birds from happening there.
Overall, however, Martin is pleased with Stroom's beach development.
It remains to be seen that the city is taking care of it.
With pediatric, lit and freshly asphalt roads, it has become more appealing.
Once upon a time, the rollers got just one way to drive, "Martin notes.
Artichoke finds in Strom: coins, only coins
The 40-year-old Dimitar, who combs the beach with a metal detector, has had to take advantage of the morning ebb period.
He does not believe that today or in the future he will find anything precious.
The sea gods are not generous enough for that.
"I have been dealing with it for a year and have not found anything valuable so far," Dmitry reports.
As a hobbies hunter, Dmitrichenko has some euro coins, bottles and also dangerous pounds that later throw in the bin.

Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25 percent
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at their former levels as powerhouse growth and easing inflation have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as households' squeezed incomes have put interest rates on hold.
Policy makers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6: 2 to hold at rates of 0.25 percent and fewer members are calling for a rise this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7 per cent and 2018 to its 1.6 per cent, and warned that pressure on household incomes will persist as inflation is still expected to rise to near 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank also signalled a rise in rates over the next few years to curb inflation due to Brexit, and financial markets may need a higher rise in borrowing costs than expected.
Members also voted a year ago in favour of a partial withdrawal of the economic mammoth package that was launched in Brexit.
The bank completes a fixed-rate financing scheme in February, which offers banks cheap financing, although said it now expected a £15 billion offer of £115 billion, under this scheme.
Within minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says: "in the MPC's central forecast gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future as the difficult situation of households' real incomes continues to have an impact on consumption."
On rates, it was reiterated that "some effort of monetary policy is needed to ease inflation" and to a "somewhat larger" extent than markets have anticipated.
The stock exchange currently predicts the first increase in the third quarter of next year and a second increase in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all kinds of jumps are gradual and limited.
The bank's reduced growth forecasts for this and for next year are comparable to May's forecasts of 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The forecast for a 1.8-percent growth in 2018 was maintained.
After that news, the pound fell on the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 per cent to $US1.31 and 0.4 per cent to €1.11.
The decision not to make the changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened rising hopes of a rise in GDP in the second quarter from 0.2 per cent in the previous three months to 0.3 per cent.
The bank says growth is likely to persist at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it is starting to gather some momentum at the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave rising inflation and miserable wage rises to joyous households, saying the situation would get a little worse before improving.
It added that monetary policy cannot prevent a hit to incomes in the next few years, but a marked recovery in wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also boosted by rising demand for British produce, which partially compensates for lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were moved 0.25 per cent last August after a shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden weakening of £1bn.
The bank estimates it is likely to take four years to blow full life into prices and the economy.
Before the bank's latest decision, there was a feeling of growing demand for rate hikes as inflation had increased pressure on hard-pressed households; in July, three policymakers called for a rate rise of 0.5 per cent.
Inflation fell to 2.6 per cent last month, compared with 2.9 per cent in June, although the Bank's message was expected and another rise is expected in the coming months.
The bank said excess growth compared to the 2-percent target was due to a fully weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco mortgage brokers, said: "given the recent downturn in exchange rates, the mortgage market looks set to become increasingly competitive again as lenders crave work and hope to finish the year positively.
The stock exchange looks particularly favorable for those whose current deals are coming to an end, as refinancing, often without service and at low rates, has become increasingly popular. "
NHS is writing 10,000 people off the odds of creating HIV medicine
Patients have been accessing "transformative" HIV preventative treatment since September after a battle in the High Court over whether the NHS should fund the medicine.
NHS England reported that national health care now makes an estimated 10,000 people available for pre-exposure prophylactics (PrEP) during the initial three-year clinical trial.
The NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after an appeals court upheld the Supreme Court's ruling last year that the NHS is able to pay for PRP, despite the authority's own claims that the medicine should be funded by local governments instead.
NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens hailed the move unveiled on Thursday as a "new large-scale intervention," while the National Garden Foundation (NAT) described it as a "pivotal moment."
Sex health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people. In October, further clinics will be introduced anywhere in England by April.
The pre-contagion prophylactic (PrEP) is a cur of HIV drugs taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Clinical trial results show PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people with an infection risk.
Taking PRP before intercourse means that a person's body has sufficient numbers of certain drugs that prevent HIV from becoming infected.
Such medications can be taken daily or at the latest two hours before intercourse.
Candidates suitable for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV infected and do not receive treatment.
Clinicians identify suitable people who agree to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-affected partner does not receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their participation in the local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The program will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to receive the drugs this week after international procurement procedures took hold.
The objective of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PREP by gathering clinical evidence of who the drug is intended for and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture.
Stevens said: "this new large-scale intervention should complement and leverage the widespread and increasingly successful fight against HIV.
This is another milestone in the fight against one of the greatest health problems of mankind in more than three decades. "
Deborah Gold, chief executive of NAT, said: "this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
The prep, if it is targeted correctly for those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to change England's HIV epidemic.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England through this NHS funded clinical trial have access to a powerful new tool that is individually administered and does not depend on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Terrence Higgins Foundation chief executive Ian Green said: "it is now a priority to ensure that the clinical trial across the country is swiftly launched and that no members of the HIV risk group are excluded.
Now that the PRP clinical trial drug has gotten under way, we are on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of becoming infected with HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, the shadow minister for public health, said: "the start of the PRP clinical trial is very welcome and hard overdue after months of delays and dragging the government's feet.
The evidence shows how big changes this drug can bring to HIV prevention and the end of its life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us a step closer to full understanding of the PRP's advantages.
It is now important for the clinical trial to be introduced as soon as possible in the country to protect people with exposure to HIV and to take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society. "
Electricity prices rose by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania they fell.
In July, the exchange price difference between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.94, compared with EUR 7.71 this June, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price difference is the riches in the Swedish Community of Lithuania.
In Estonia, the average price of electricity was EUR 34.33 per megawatt-hour last month and the price went up 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to €36.27 per megawatt-hour.
In Finland the price was EUR 34.17 and the Nord Pool system price on the electricity exchange was EUR 26.37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices rose 12 and seven percent respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, 75% of the electricity moved to Estonia in the last month and 16% of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The other nine percent of the hours between the two countries on the following day's deals did not happen.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity jumped 99% of the time from Estonia to Latvia, and 73% of the hours were in use.
According to deals on the last trading day of July, Nasdaq's OMX market could account for an exchange price of about 34 euros in August and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affects the production price of electricity, went up last month, and the transaction cost EUR 5.04-5.47 per tonne.
Living high life - the half-floor and smart designs have turned this small Earls Courti apartment into a room home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate property innovator, switched her large Knightsbridge home in 2014 against the Earls Courts apartment.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace and that Joanne has not wrapped up her bags and sold the apartment further is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with a former life mate in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this Earls Courti apartment and had similar high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day. "
Since the first visit, this 93-square metre apartment has undergone a full novel.
At first it was a one-bedroom and a complex layout flat - to reach the bedroom you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half-floor to take advantage of high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands, "he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi Notting Hill from the operating architectural and design studios Duck & Shed to take advantage of 3.8 m heights and just create a home that could not
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so there was an architectural challenge to create a half-floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach the thing creatively.
"The metal structure is quite sophisticated," he explains.
"We had to reorganize the rooms so they would be located on top of each other without having to bow.
It was not just about building a platform, but we used a steel structure to make the altitude of both the upper and the bottom of the space correct. "
This placing allowed Erfani to create two full-height rooms in the room with plenty of dramatic elements.
The semi-floor opens with old fashioned copper light on the glamorous living room under the window of Retrouvius.
The reflective surface of golden furniture, silver detail and rethrottle Serge Mouille's luminaire highlight the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatrical, space and light saturation.
Mirrors have been added to both ends of the short corridor to make it feel longer.
In the kitchen, a mirror gives an impression of the window opening of another room.
At the entrance, the mirror store offers a place for all Joanne's dining and glass requirements.
The living room adds to the charm the opportunity to close the kitchen section if not used, generating an image of a glamorous room.
The collapsing kitchens are nothing new.
In this kitchen, however, there is a unique fact that it is a garage type of resurrected door.
"A bit of design effort went into it," explains Erfan Steel with a spooked MDF door.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it glides very easily when put up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra square feet, an extra bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"At the end of the day, the floor price is what you are selling - or what gives real estate value," Erfan says.
"The property broker steps into a sun-shaped room and makes calculations based on the floor area."
Here they have been able to increase the floor, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"The materials are the ones you touch and thereby help create an emotional connection with the home," Erfan says.
"You do not pardon the wall into an electric cable.
This is important, but does not make the heart sound. "
This shows that good design and increased area help make something amazing out of a fairly normal apartment.
In fact, they could even create a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
Chief executive Dane Jensen is a headhunter in Chicago who competes with a colleague for professional excellence.
No more than the amount of money that has been earned, which all ethics forgo.
His wife and three children are seen by a man just in the early morning and late evening.
In the first half of the film, I pounce myself on the thought that this is, after all, a version of the business world - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's voiceover is similar.
What the film goes on, the less the shot-making element, however, and the moralising intent of the filmmakers is increasingly beginning to stand out.
For life-changing experience, the protagonist becomes a son of cancer.
The choice must now be made between working life and family life.
The dreaming son of an architect makes a father walking around Chicago's big buildings think of really important things like faith, goodness, love... without even touching the twin towers' disaster.
After the third scene in which the son's father opens his eyes, there is a feeling that the filmmakers have gone from goal to goal to the audience to cry, because even the most expensive heart viewer is unable to recover from cancer.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation looks almost hopeless, his father once and for all understands the morality of his work and makes a charity work for an old man.
Now, in a sense, I bet with myself - if the film has a fussy feel, I reward my perplexity after the film with coffee, if I am wrong, then the scene could be applauded for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there is a suspicion of depriving an ice-cream coffee - when a spouse calls to Dane from a hospital and a man rushes along the tarmac of a corridor.
The son, however, has grown wonderfully healthy, and although his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can also feel good - I can already predict the end of the American drama very well!
In truth, the film is well engineered, all the elements required for it exist.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and morality beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
Cold brings this film well in.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curb the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it in real terms.
In this case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the White House's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information reaching President Trumpin, including news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in the offing water.
Here's a cover from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the new White House chief of staff John F. Kelly got together on his first day of work with top officials, he pointed out a key problem at President Donald Trump's White House, which he planned to address.
Kelly told officials the information must move through him, either on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if good information were shared with him. "
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it as well and they have Trump's tame with his monitoring of media consumption failed.
President Trump's relationship with television stretches back decades, and even now he is in the White House, his television viewing habits have gone nowhere.
"When candidate Trump was annoyed by the media coverage, he paid to show that he was also reported in the affected publications honestly," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg said in February.
Politico's Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "according to six former campaign staff members, managing Trump's Twitter habits is key to ensuring that he's personal media consumption also includes endorsements steady."
OK.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter use habits have once been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something the rest of us do not know that Trump's tweet would have been even more flamboyant without their interventions.
We probably never learn about a tweet that Trump did not post.
If the helpers were able to save him either or, a few times, they've been worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from consistently generating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, made up of competing cliques, people without exception try to advance their own interests by conveying to Trump material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be credible.
Politico, reflecting the course of the whole story, wrote in May about advisers' tendency to feed the president with strategically questionable information.
One of the examples, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher, is as follows:
"Current and former Trump subordinates say that Trump can respond to the negative press, particularly with a damaging impact on leaflets, exploding, taking the obsession of identifying their source.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone accidentally gave a copy of an online provocator, Charles C. Johnson, a GotNews.com article that accused the chief of staff Walsh of this
It makes no difference that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter due to mockery or that he did not offer any specific evidence or that he has also made false allegations in the past and withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and began to inherit Walsh about the subordinates. "
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and White House Chancellery leader Rob Porter, "have been trying to establish a system for managing and documenting documents reaching Trumpin."
How did it succeed?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader of Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive, and his helpers are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians who come from abroad to the capital do not get permission to make bitter appearances.
There are many foreigners kissing in the center of Tallinn.
Those with whom the air fire came to mind admitted to playing in the old town without the permission of the city government.
First we found three street musicians close to the gates of Virgil who had taken the same number of dogs with them.
It was clearly evident that musicians with wristbands and broken clothes were backpackers, to whom one shower would wear off.
Despite the appearance, the company's only woman played a tale with an amusing rhythm on the chorus, while one man next to her with three balls in the jungle and invited the bystanders closer.
A third man had sat next to them on one of the backpacks and smoked in the heartstring himself ready to turn a plate.
Their three dogs did not let themselves be bothered by the passing crowd.
The accordion played with Noemi and ballads gestured on Bob's talk of kissing the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the company's appearance was to collect ticket money for the ship travelling to Finland on the same day.
On the question of whether they asked permission from the city for kissing in the old town, Noemi and Bob shook their heads.
First, we did not know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a few and mostly be granted permits for a month or something like that.
There is no point in paying for it, "Bob explained.
When we reopened the gates of Virgil about 20 minutes later, we saw two women at the musicians and chasing them away.
The company moved backpacks and dogs to the Virgil Centre's intersection for a happiness test.
The Virgil street also represented three Polish young men, one of whom played a violin, the other a clarinet and the third was downright carrying an electronic piano.
"We are here to offer people entertainment to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living," explained trio pianist Mivosh.
Mivoshi said they are aware that there must be permission from the city government to appear.
"Obviously we do not have it," he said joking.
But we hope that when people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we go elsewhere, but we must try, "he added.
The Bank of Estonia bought €149 million of bonds under the public asset buyback programme of the eurozone central banks in July, the central bank's bond portfolio grew to €4.36 billion.
The central bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases.
The President of the Estonian Bank, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained in response to the debate by members of the Board of Governors that the central banks' asset purchase plan for the euro system includes three different purchase programmes: financial covered bonds (Covered bonds), BS secured bonds), BS
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors who sold bonds to invest money elsewhere.
The impact of purchases will fall on the productivity of lower-risk assets and will motivate investors to take greater risks.
As a general rule, as part of a public bond buyback program, each central bank buys its national government bonds, other countries do not buy bonds.
Since the Estonian state has not issued the bonds, the Bank of Estonia is making so-called replacements within the volume allocated to them.
Alternate buying is also done by central banks in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
The Bank of Estonia generally buys the bonds of European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank, according to Hansson.
The Bank of Estonia buys bonds as part of the asset purchase program as of March 2015.
In the meantime, Ecclestone's bonds were also purchased, but from June 2016 the Bank of Estonia will no longer buy Elering bonds.
On behalf of euro area central banks, both Elering and the Estonian Energy Bond are bought by Finland's central bank since June.
Migrants ignore ditch and return 'millionair'
Some of the West Midlands's wealthiest home owners have come back in a furious confrontation with determined riders who have driven the council into a trench to win back a field away from their villas.
Migrants have parked their 20 trailers off the field for a prosperous "millionaire track" on the baptised Solihull street.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks after only being kicked out of there in May without letting themselves be confused by a ditch dug to block their entry by a councillor.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the defense, squeezing their vehicles through an unobstructed section that was left on foot.
Furious residents have flocked to Solihull council, saying the council is "useless in dealing with the problem."
An unnamed resident said: "they moved there on Monday night after their exclusion from Bentley Heath, where they were throwing passing stones.
Councillors need to be ashamed to take action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The migrants were there in May, they were driven away and now they are back again.
They came last night, probably more today. "
He added: "Birmingham councillors know how to deal with such things by acquiring long barriers to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to have to continue paying the council tax if the councillor cannot even prevent such a thing. "
One local resident, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: "it is ridiculous. We have only seen the last of these migrants left, and a new offensive is already taking place.
This time the number has increased, and grassland has even seen the horse remembers. "
A spokesman for Solihull councillor said: "we are aware that there are unacceptable campsites on land near Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihull police to take the necessary legal action.
Gathering evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to police, calling Number 101.
This will help create a picture of the situation for the Court if we present the case to them. "
The Weekend festival will also be visited by culture minister Indrek Saar, among others, who is delighted that Estonia has been able to bring the real world's top names.
The question of why the Weekend festival is so important to Estonians is answered by Saar that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the full frontline of the festival's three days.
But he says that the real players in his area have come to Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been able to be brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre are brought home - that is not often what we were wearing," the Minister for Culture says.
What performers at the festival, though, are the most telling of themselves?
I consider myself a relatively old person, and for the old people of minuscule, it is definitely one of the most experienced artist Armin van Buren who picked up last night.
After all, according to his record, all of us have at some point also intricate ourselves, "he says.
But it still brings out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian players too: starting with NOËP and they can be read in a series.
In reality, this concentration of known names is very high, "he says.

Audi upgrades automakers amid criticism of up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer a software supplement for more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the BMW chairman, the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities including the BMW home town of Munich that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engines.
No company described these operations as recalls.
European carmakers have advertised the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States vigorously to help comply with regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide released from diesel engines is considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment to neutralize emissions from diesel vehicles will increase for the car industry, making it difficult to keep the car price competitive.
While German carmakers are under close investigation, the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of hedging powerful carmakers and ignoring signs pointing to the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which silenced the use of so-called washing devices, which allowed the adaptation of the exhaust demonstration car to comply with the regulations while testing the exhaust.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the department's thermodynamics subunit was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccho Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and can go to trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was pulled in Germany into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, when authorities accused the Audi system of installing to circumvent claims of European exhaust quantities, thereby extending an investigation that had been focused on the United States previously.
Audi's involvement in the investigation could be a big blow to Volkswagen's luxury car manufacturer generating a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
Estonian schools receive EU flags of 20 000 euros.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy European Union flags for the purpose of the Presidency by 1 September.
In total, the measure will receive 105x158 inch of the European Union flag 570 educational establishments.
Flags are intended to be exhibited indoors, they must be carried in a quality printing technique indoors, also with tunnel confirmation, broker the ERR news portal.
The text reads: 'a gift to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of the 570 flag is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education's price, or one flag costs EUR 35.
Journalist's murder highlights growing threat situation in Mexico
Weekend Riodoce workers usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans for Sinaloa State's most recent chaos, sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and rampant drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They are told it is important to change their routine.
Two senior writers are discussing which one looks safer: whether to bring the children to an office with them, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words to the head of the room: "enemies," "neutral," "allies."
They ask reporters in each column's names to offer evidence of no need, enough impressions and insomnia.
There are suspected drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on a whole list of males who make the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
There are no breath breaks of violence, and the more dead bodies accumulate across the country, the majority of them are still under threat in December 2012, according to the Committee of Independent Journalists.
The latest casualties include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence gives a deep feel, although his presence can be perceived everywhere in the Riodoce building's façade hanging a large picture of the medium finger of Valdez with the letter "Room" and two hallmarks
The meeting will take place less than two months after he died. Reporters will discuss common trauma, his nightmare, sleep, paranoia.
Although a separate public prosecutor's office was set up to handle journalists' cases in 2010, only two cases have been brought to justice by the Committee of Journalists.
As with most of the annual murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime, with the number reaching thousands, the killers of journalists rarely reach court.
Riodoce's editorial continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the murderers' data and justice, the security meeting, according to Ibarra, is not much use.
"The very silly thing is to waste your time in this meeting," he says.
"As long as the cause is not known, you mistrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital Culiacan on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive only a few quarters before the two men stopped him in the red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and shot 12 times.
The gunman drove past Valdez's car and made an accident in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left behind by a woman and two adult children.
Rumours spread freely in Culiacan.
However, there is essentially only silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival cliques struggle to fill a power vacuum.
It makes no difference that on the streets of Sinaloa, a person or even several are shot every day, or that the dead garden is dressed in abundant double-decorated drug kings.
Let us forget for a moment that peacetime implies that only one cartel is run by a seaside state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was thoroughly aware of the dangers involved in his work, Riodoce's co-founder and President Ismail Bojorquez (60) feels unable to protect his girlfriend
He believes the killing was fostered by two mistakes.
The first was the publication of an interview with a rival and military-owned cartel click of a nutmeg with Damaso Lopez in February.
This piece of letters may have angered the sons by suspected gang members buying all copies of the edition as soon as they reached the newspaper stalls.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own security after a crackdown on a newspaper editorial echoed in another story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been alive for so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to be permanently present.
He worked as a veterans reporter at the newspaper Noroes in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said Sinaloa "was impossible to deal with the press without the drug problem intact."
The newspaper collected time with its bold and honest displays, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish robust surveys without fear of censorship and readers were fascinated by the print from which they were able to read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its Latin American coverage.
In the same year, Valdez won the National Committee for Journalism (AKK) International Prize for Freedom of the Press for its courage to sue Mexico's drug maker wherever it leads.
He openly admitted to being afraid.
"I want to live on," he said of accepting the ACK award.
Last October, he told the television channel Rimpeviento TV in an interview given that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to embrace the task that with the journalist agency comes another opportunity to play a fool.
I do not want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I did not say what was going on. "
Riodoce's collector misses Valdez, a funny man who rode like Lowry, a friend who shared kindly emblems and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his kimber.
He went from office across the road to an El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they are asking if his routine love became fatal to him.
His death has also made them feel suspicious about how to do their job best and stay alive.
"They do not like the limbs of their wives, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things should not have been touched," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is strong self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting your instincts.
When the thing smells suspiciously, keep away.
According to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and so this thing happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros or other states, which are home to corrupt institutions.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodoce workers got together for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; some days before, it was revealed that only the spyware sold to governments had been used in Mexico to track journalists and activists.
In front of the house, two policemen searched for relief from the 40-degree heat in the tree's shadow.
The government assigned them to guard Riodoce's office, located in a four-storey building in Culiacan's middle-class neighborhood.
Some reporters pondered semi-joking about whether these policemen belong to the 50 per cent of policemen whose governor himself has been unreliable.
Several months have passed since reporters have travelled to mountainous counties where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
Riodoce's this week's edition addressed three key stories.
One was the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing tale of spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And from the prosecutor's office a quarter away from Culiacan's one of the most expensive restaurants, a group of people were kidnapped.
There was no official announcement on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it had to be careful when it was time to write about what everyone in the city knows about the restaurant as a memorial for both drug traders and authorities.
The reporter learned in public documents that the restaurant was registered to the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
More recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption under widespread coverage of lawsuits.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of the nickname El Chapo wearing Guzman escaped from a military raid.
Just months earlier, readers would have searched the Valdez collum to get information about the kidnappings from the best sources.
"Previously we would have already known what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose dressed body construction has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all channels of communication have broken up with our sources."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for tags and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and editorial workers have become something they could never expect activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of labels and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for a rally for another reporter.
Salvador Amanda disappeared in western Michoacan state three days after the killing of Valdez.
A burnt body has been found and, according to officials, it belongs to him on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal and chalk up the phrase "SOS press" as an organized protest on sidewalks and buildings.
On that day, President Bojorquez is away in Washington trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
A day after Valdez's death in a meeting with the Sinaloa governor, Ramirez accused authorities of scouring journalists and killing them because of telling the truth.
Afterwards, he pleaded for him to be diverted from reflecting the government's actions, worried that anger had affected objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said Mexican journalists were "encumbered" by organized crime, complicit state officials and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Narcojournalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but are also done at the behest of politicians and security forces who are mesmerised with organised crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and state officials.
"In Mexico you died because you are going to be silenced," Ramirez said.
The murders obviously have a direct impact.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
He was found dead with a letter, presumably signed by a cartel in Los Zetas: "I am here for my reporters."
A computer keyboard and headphones were leaked next to his masked head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as a newspaper in El Norte's northern border state of Chihuahua after the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others let go as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after their director's murder in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly spoke to the narcotics cartel in the front-page headline, "What do you want of us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even their country.
It is a nervous decision.
It is hard to find work in exile and they still have to whip the streets to avoid threats.
And sometimes they are driven, as probably happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in 2015 in a Mexico apartment three months after being burgled in Veracruz.
Those who remain on standby and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that the coverage of the drug business scares her.
"Mexico is on its way to hell and that is why I am going to be a reporter," he said.
At midnight on one recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodoce's editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and kicked beer when suddenly everyone's phones started.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people had been killed in a fire exchange between rival gangs and security forces, according to confirmed reports.
The war continued to escalate, as were several of the messages left by cartels found in the area.
From the edge of the walkway, reporters posted the news on a mobile phone using Riodoce's website upstairs.
The next day's front gig needed a change.
The sirens huddled along another exchange of fire in the area.
Bojorquez lashed out at the side of guard police to see if they were on alert.
If they were afraid, at least they did not show it.
The newspaper's fallen founder, under a massive portrait with his average finger seen throughout Sinaloa, was edited by Riodice staff in his footsteps.
"How could one think of closure at all," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day Javier was killed, an apprentice asked me to send him to the streets to reporters?"
Dinosaur used to avoid enemies by safekeeping
At first glance it looks like a statue, though quite scary.
Scientists have now unveiled the first findings regarding the discovery of a chicken miner's unbelievable ninevitability, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as "dinosaur Mona."
It is downright so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that his armored skin was a red brown color and his past had been somewhat "sophisticated."
The magazine Current Biology published by reporters described the present as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
Phosphorus is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the chalk age, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation rattled the researchers, who described it as "truly remarkable."
This armored coated vegetarian is the journal National Geographic, according to the best-preserved type of fossils ever found.
It was found on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk, when he mined at the Suncor Millenum mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that did not resemble the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The discovered fossils were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The next six years were working on excavating the animal from a 2500-pound (1100-kilometer) plot.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be brought to the public eye.
"If a bit of an eye can be scrambled, you can almost believe he is asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a publicist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs - the dinosaur Mona Lisana."
When examining her skin, the researchers found that this plant worker, while covered in armored and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely to be significantly compromised by muscular dinosaurs.
This dinosaur with plenty of armored armored and white protective colours used to hide from predators, and applied a shading technique known as resistance and also used by many of today's animals.
This, according to experts, allowed the dinosaur to migrate better to the surroundings and avoid the enemies, as larger dinosaurs probably boarded him.
This creature, belonging to a family of 110 million year-olds, first came to the news in May and is now visiting the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The researchers have now examined the nature and named it the Borealopelta Marketchell museum laboratory Mark Mitchell, who belonged to a team that spent more than 7000 hours revealing the animal.
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of the self, Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the armored animal on the body.
They discovered a counterinsurgency - a method of protection commonly used in the animal kingdom, meaning the upper half of the present was darker than the bottom.
Although reticence is common, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much larger than the animals living with resistance today.
It hints that the dinosaur was actively hunted by other muscular dinosaurs that evolution preferred as a survival tactic instead of shading.
But most of the animals that use modern countershelter - such as deer, sepsis or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable as a yield, which suggests that nodosaurus was really struggling to survive.
"The forceful hunting of a dinosaur covered with huge and ample armored shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of chalk age could be," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the armored organic compounds also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was red brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal to get clues about its life, including its intestinal preserved contents, to figure out what the animal ate for its latest meal.
They believe the dinosaur crashed into a river in the death, thereby reaching the flow into the sea, where it swelled in front of the ocean floor.
At that time Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and rivers and oceans probably went much further inland than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable as it is fully covered in preserved armored skin, while it has also remained three-dimensional, maintaining the animal's original shape," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the chalk age.
There is not a great deal of imagination to be used to reconstruct it - it is just enough to scramble eyes and feel like he is asleep. "
The chalk era was a time when huge, two-foot moving music-eating dinosaurs - theropods - were stunned on Earth.
Although the King of Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could be hunted by some of his formidable predecessors.
They include Acrocanthola saurus, 38 feet (11.5 feet) long and six tons weighing monster.
The researchers, whose recent findings are published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta smelled after death into the sea and it mummified in the mud.
The conjecture was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk, when he exited the Millenum mine at Fort McMurray near northern Alberta in Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armored, and it is a hollow cone until the hip.
These Oaks were on average 18 feet (five feet) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (130kg).
Its shoulders invaded two 20 inches long of the ora.
Scientists believe this armored plant reef adventure through the current western Canada, until the flooded river in its open sea of pride.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial site helped preserve the magnificent detail of its armored.
The stinky remnants of this particular self are so well preserved that the mysterious armored plates along the dinosaur titles still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the journal National Geographic: "such a degree of preservation is as rare as a lotto victory.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The remains of rocky skin still cover the mysterious armored plates of the animal in the skull.
A better front leg leaps next to him, and five of the stems are tied upward.
I will be able to count the Finns on his debut. "
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Kelle streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a full shock.
Just a day after travelling to New York, this resident of St. Louisiana sat on a bed in a rented room via Airbnb, browsing the phone on Facebook.
He ran onto the post of his cousin's schoolmate.
It read: 'police have just killed an 18-year-old youth and he is still lying on the street.'
He was confused about why no one else had posted this information on his stream, which is why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
Constant @ TheEPharoah user posts were repeatedly shared on his timeline.
A U.N. spokesman from the St. Louisiana area broadcast a real-time tweet about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which lay on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It is crazy," thought Ferrell of the endorsements.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away but saw again later in the evening with a tweet that reported this time from a gathering of people in Canfield Drive.
Photos were shared from the police front and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and held a sign reading "Ferguson police killed just my unarmed son!."
He watched a real-time stream in which a policeman stood with a grazing dog in front of a group of protesters.
In another video, another policeman vanished a gun in his words and shouted: "I am killing you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he hit himself with a thought: "it is unusual."
"" This is not the kind of murder we are used to and what we might call typical. "
I felt terrified at that point.
I was angry and crying. '
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
Having landed at 23, he went to his father to catch his six-year-old daughter and decided they would ride the twin Ferguson the next morning.
What took place with Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" (" whose streets? "), which premieres on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and siren from the perspective of the people who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with his daughter - who was wearing a floral dress and a fitting crown on her head - Ferguson was chatting again on the subject before that morning.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?" She recalls asking herself.
"We are currently driving Ferguson because police killed an 18-year-old boy and that is not right."
"I could not bring him in," Ferrell said afterwards.
"What is happening now is... the culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle.
It must learn about activism and organisation, while also feeling the different layers of black experience and living conditions, and what we must do to become free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to nurture him so that he does not personally experience blatant racism, he is no different from another black girl.
I feel I would do him a disservice if I would protect him from this world. "
The first stop they made when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florida Road - a police station over the road, which had become a kind of campsite where activists were waiting for news of Wilson.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who was preparing lunch meals.
They put food bags together and helped distribute them to protesters.
For Ferrell, slowly began to take shape as a new type of activism.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he said, noting that when he was a Missouri-St. Louisiana University student, he was president of the Association of Least Advertising Facilities.
"I did not have any organizing experience.
It all just slammed. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met one of the film's co-chief executives, Sabah Folayang, during an evening rally.
Folayan said he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was happening.
The question came to Ferrell's head: "do you try to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited?"
Such skepticism was the result of countless cases in which people - often false - come into the community and try to profit from its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "we had heard that the voice of people born and grown in Ferguson would not be heard and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already kicked his hands with fellow junior Damon Davis, an artist in the area who was known for activism in connection with the death row inmates.
His involvement turned the project into a rope for Ferrell and another six other locals who were watched by the film's "Whose Streets?" Team after Brown's shooting for years.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, but speaks for us ourselves," Davis said.
"It was important to me how these people are portrayed, because that is how I am portrayed."
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was intended to show that the movement was not about "redemption leader but community coming together," Folayan said, making him the most open player in the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" Documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt as if I was nude," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the finished lineout.
"But I realized that doing this job and mending black people must be accompanied by some vulnerability."
What is more, Ferrell's story highlights and re-puts the role of black gay woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three initials, who were thinking on social media in the wake of the 2012 killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin, are gay.
"In the lead role black homosexual women have maintained the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and that is precisely because we have to fight constantly on multiple fronts.
Black homosexual women must bear all this burden. "
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women."
He argues, however, that "it is not a matter of some kind of level playing field" - Ferrell was not chosen as the centre of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who ate the right energy," he said.
"But it is no coincidence that he was located directly on the front line because there is a lot at stake in living as a black homosexual woman in such hubs.
Its energy can be perceived through the screen. "
Meanwhile, news cameras have long since disappeared from Ferguson, but racial links between the community and police remain fragile.
The parole sentence imposed on Ferrell during the demonstration for blocking the road will run for another 2.5 years.
He describes the social political atmosphere in the region, which he calls home, as simply "huge sparkling."
Nevertheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra he has been eating in the memory since he took to the streets of Ferguson as many as three years ago.
"It is our responsibility to fight for our freedom.
It is our responsibility to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. "
7 nipples on how to overcome potholes after Weekend feast
Some of the stubborn masculinaries find it helpful, after a nappier celebration.
Or draw from the saying "avoid potholes, piss drunk."
But it is just the inevitable ponytail and the health of a decent pint.
What can you do to feel better in the morning after today and tomorrow's Weekend trend - or other celebration - and to overcome the potholes as painlessly as possible?
Joo water.
Alcohol down and onto, after a big celebration in the morning... or possibly even alcohol instead.
As the body loses a lot of fluid when using alcohol, it somehow has to be recovered.
With water, mineral substances are also washed out of the body and sestap is a good drink of mineral water.
Since the snapshot is often irritated after napping, it is particularly good if it is bubble-free or just lightly gambled.
Go for a walk.
Surely it would not cost to burst trees onto a grandmother with potholes - it could prove a fatal misdecision.
But a light walk helps the body remember again what it feels like to be alive.
Lying in a tent and sleeping in a pothole is a more time-consuming way of getting healthy.
Give the body energy back slowly and cautiously.
If you are already going to be okay from yesterday's overdrinking, it is certainly not worth trying to load a large fat ferry.
Start with, for example, the fresh juice containing the fruit roots of your body quietly to market.
If the health of the South is already suffering, you could try a pulpit, for example.
And a little later, the selector.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretics release your body from the doomsday water.
As has already been said: water and juice are your friends.
Do not contribute to painkillers.
If you take a painkiller in order to prevent pohmelli in the evening, your tax will have to deal not only with alcohol, but also with paracetamol or ibuprofen and lose performance.
So spoil your liver even more and, in the future, potholes are worse off.
In addition, the painkiller does not last long in the body.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, do not do it with an empty gut - it irritates your already dirty snake.
Or if you do not have a partner, you can do well with yourself.
It works roughly the same way as walking, but walking does not get orgasm.
But avoid too much active pace and crazy hangovers - during a potholes, the physical effort should be moderate.
Make fun.
With time friends and fellow sufferers fool talk, make simple silly jokes and laugh kindly about themselves and others (suffering).
The joke and laughter may not wipe off the pothole, but it is surely fun to tolerate the aftershocks.
For once, pohmell goes over anyway!
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff searched as suspects in murder
Police say they are searching nationwide behind a University of Northwestern professor and an Oxford University employee who has been found with suspects after being found with fatal stabbing wounds by a man's body.
According to Cook County court documents, arrest warrants were issued Monday for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Latham and 56-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in first-degree murder
According to the documents, the 26-year-old from Cornell-Duranleau died after being stabbed repeatedly.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago police station to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
Police officers received a phone call and found the victim with multiple spike wounds when arriving at the Grand Plaza apartment house.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and investigators are treating the stabbing as murder while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
University Public Relations Vice President Alan K. Cubbage said in an e-mailed statement that Latheim is now temporarily removed from work and has been barred from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"The act is now a criminal matter under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is working with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant at Oxford University's financial department.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an e-mailed statement: "we have been in touch with the British police and ready to assist US investigating authorities in every possible way."
In addition, the statement said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wish he would hand himself out.
Anthony Guglielmi, director of the Chicago Police Department's communications department, urges the suspects to urge themselves to surrender to authorities.
"The police have a clue where they are staying, but we are dealing with identifying the exact location increasingly intensively," Mr Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said the suspects are helping to search for local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from a Grand Plaza apartment manager who had just received an encryptic hint that something had happened in the apartment on No. 1008.
According to police descriptions, this was a spectacle.
Guglielmi says it is not clear whether the event itself took place on July 27.
He said security cameras allege Latham and Warren were staying in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
Grand Plaza management sent a letter to residents saying: "police are currently working on identifying the chronology of events and the background of the victim, and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that the act was a family dispute."
Start-ups helping your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce start-ups, but the polls were unprofitable.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse still, misleading.
And even as he pledged to ensure anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"This system just was not consistent and objective," said Errett, who heads an e-commerce company with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called on the outside to help.
A new type of human-resources start-ups is emerging, helping companies figure out what their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software whose firm aims to measure employee involvement, they allow companies to conduct sudden interviews, target established teams and demographic groups, provide anonymity for workers and, in some cases, to bypass the hot e-board.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit designed to monitor health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" Asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of engagement firm Redwood City
Erretti said he has got a much better understanding of what his staff think and feel in the three years he has used Glint.
In addition to the sudden surveys and firsthand teams, it offers a corporate heat map that provides insight into which departments have the most complaints and which executives have the lowest support, allowing it to identify the causes.
Companies have begun to understand that they have to stay in touch with their working culture so as not to become the next Ubman, which has been wrapped up in scandals since a former employee published a blogpost that described them as' brave '.
For start-ups like Glint, the desire for insight is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation and compliance could be more than 118.7 billion dollars, according to financial technology statistics website Seattle's Talk Payments data for 2020 worth more than 118.7 billion dollars.
Denver Colorado Unified company Convertible, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, observed an increase in interest and activity this year against the backdrop of Uber's dubious reputation.
Convertible has nearly 600 customers, among them Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered itself as a customer.
Like Glint, Convertible lets companies send custom pulse interviews, collect real-time confidential answers and watch heat cards from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous message line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has been anointed by regulators," said Convert founder and chief executive Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, the company could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercetti for more than a year to ensure staff are aware of the rules and operations and provide an easy way to communicate with Corporation headquarters
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the phone number or email address of the Corporation's headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often a discouraging and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to monitor employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercet, however, there are potential problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that did not reach previously managers who acted in other cities or states to identify and deal with them more quickly.
"I am able to get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of the workers," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we will protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said companies began taking ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, perhaps after auditory firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethics violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But it was only when "social media became mature" that companies realised they could not prevent their black laundry from publicly washing the web.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convertible offer their software as a service by taking periodic fees from companies for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supportive of both start-ups.
Convercenti was funded in February by $10 million by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thereby raising the collected capital value to $47 million.
Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, raising the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments come as no surprise when it comes to the interconnection between companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competition-rich markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are mere stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy at the company, feel they are being listened to and that the work they are doing is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, vice president of department for general benefits and employees
Investors earn returns if their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase employee commitment and involvement, it is no wonder they find support.
Having data on employee involvement is important, according to labour culture experts.
But this data is useless unless the company's followers do anything about it.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can raise expectations that changes are ahead.
And if changes do not occur quickly enough or at all, it can cause frustration and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be ready for 4,000 conversations," said Kotter International President Russell Rath, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things were not brought to an end, the workers shouldn't say, 'Do you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you do not care, why should I care? "
According to Erretti, Madison Reed, which now organizes surveys among workers once a month, has been able to implement measures on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from frustrated employees at the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, is gathering new data on workers and it is hoped that in the long run it will bring with it a longer-term commitment from workers in an industry known for its high labor turnover.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses. "
Eurozone shining star is Baltimore: incomes grow rapidly
While the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are fast approaching the incomes of Western Europe's rich countries, Bloomberg writes in reference to the ECB's report.
According to the Central Bank, total economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations since 1999.
Behind the success is low debt, rapidly improving institutions and business-friendly policies.
"The Baltic states in one of Slovakia are among the few countries in the euro area where real GDP per head of purchasing power has significantly converged on the EU average," the central bank reported.
Although the goal is that the total economic output per capita was equivalent to the richest Western Europe, in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies was just 2/3 of the 15 national average, which belonged to the European Union before the 2004 round of enlargement.
Low wages have led Bales to seek better wages from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees Baltimore in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, local residents are not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the inhabitants of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, little less than half of those surveyed thought this about their countries' economies.
NCAA decision to cancel twice-daily trips makes Bruins days long
The clock is nearly 23 when the Tropical Storm UCLA footballers stop to chat at the edge of the team's new exercise ground on campus.
Some of them have loaded a backhand shirt, revealing the sweat on their training camp's first day of effort.
For much of the team, these Christmas minutes offer a midday break.
Players taking part in the summer courses are heading back to the final exams after a three-hour trench before returning to Wasserman football centre next morning at 6.30pm.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday's kick-off Tuesday.
NCAA's decision to cancel trips to reduce player load twice a day has actually made their days longer - at least until final exams get to one side on Friday.
For that reason, UCLA's three first workouts were timed to start at 7.15 to fit into the players' already tight schedule.
The transfer from two coaches a day means more one-day trips - the start of the Bruins' training camp was raised almost a week ahead of last season and for the first time in the Mora Six Westwood season.
They have 18 trenches in plan until August 20 before starting official preparation for the opening game against Texas A & M-S in September.
Mora says he is in favour of NCAA rule change, although it will add another item to the players' tight schedules.
"They have a huge load on three or four days and that is a serious challenge," Mora said.
"And they break through that ordeal; they tighten, they are nice young.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it will be a real pleasure. "
Once the camp is complete, UCLA's operations will be closed, which will not be an easy task, given the clear view of their fields from a nearby parking lot and from a side-by-side shoot
From this weekend, the hotel's Bruins players will occupy the field, but Mora acknowledged that problems could arise with free rooms during the season.
"We are taking security measures," Mora said.
"It is a real concern and it is not at all exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film a workout.
If you have a record of training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we use a security team there and 8 parking spots.
We will do our best by using it.
I try not to worry much about it.
We have a plan in place. "
The Election Union of Savisare-Ivanova, the League of Local Elections of the Revolutionary Party, appears to be taking part in the same party initiative of Kristiina Ojaland of Estonia
The tires, however, will be counted in the fall, and the key question will be whether enough disillusioned voters will be divided on them all.
Who stays with Savile?
If a small number of supporters of Edgar Savisre have been diminished, the events organised in honour of his electoral union may be unearthed.
One member of the assembly of states, some former and current middle partisans and many unfamiliar faces - will such boots be the composition of the electoral union?
And can the reason why a few loyal followers and friends of Savisair are being held aside from their candidacy in Tallinn be seen as a sign of corruption by the perpetrators of corruption?
A musical video of a Russian pop song filmed on the roof of the city centre with the parent of the 17-year-old Lasnahill district; and in every sense a primitive computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratu is trying to avoid
We look forward to seeing the perception of the other parties in the youth election campaign.
If a Channel 2 or TV3 audience watches from the beginning of August against a black square, two choices remain: to accept that in future only ETV operators, ETV2, TV and Tallinn will only see
There are probably also those who at first openly cheer about the advertising-free television experience, but at the end of the day, albeit reluctantly, pay for television and ads.
Pub music, noisy crowd and rubbish left on the streets are the unpleasant sidelines of every major music festival.
However, if you do not want to be part of the sea, it is worth rediscovering the country at home instead of painting your head - and bedrooms for a hefty sum to the festival guests.
Washington changes green card rules
Media outlets cite President Donald Trump, who says a new US immigration plan is planned that changes the rules of the green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people a year, stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
New rules have proposed by Republicans and the president supports them.
The bill goes to the two chambers of Congress for debate.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, as it changes the way the US handles green cards to citizens from other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current program.
The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, according to US media outlets.
Siberian seto youngsters move to town, pensioners back to land.
Jevseyev Anatoly continues the tradition of the famous seto gold miners along the Mississippi River.
He works 140 kilometres from his home as an extra nurse in Kuwai as a gold cartel driver.
It is a tough job: two months in a row without rest days for 12 hours of work and then only ten days at home and back again.
During the three years worked in the artel, Anatoly has seen gold only once.
"There is a hard order: by going in, it is thoroughly checked that the wall would not lead, and by going out to gold would not take," Anatoly says.
Mare Piho chatted to the village of Haida with local seto John, who has told him a lot about his family's memories in Siberia.
The still preserved archaic culture of Siberian sethos is also beginning to affect home-sethos because it is just so fabulous, thinks the most thoroughly distant sethos studied by Piho Mare.
His first trip to Siberia this year marks 30 years.
During that time he has been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many settlers did they migrate to Siberia in the late 19th century and early 20th century in order to obtain land here?
This is an outstanding issue.
I'll claim £8,000.
I counted it out to the stories of Siberian seto men who have also thought about it.
Exactly, it is difficult to say because up to 30 people may have come in one group at the time, but the passport was only given to the man.
The passport was given only one, but there were children, nurses and female relatives.
Look how big that territory was here!
It was several times larger than the historic Setown.
After all, it needed to be educated, managed in some way.
The sethos came here as peasants, but their lives changed because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture but also to the river (palm parking), gold mines, industry.
In New Petseri, for example, many sethos later went to work in the classified city of Krasnojarsk-45 (the Soviet power was built by the uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the sethos then make up the majority of the population in this region?
Yes, they lived compact.
In addition, there was a long tradition of marrying and many grandchildren.
Seventy-eight children in the family were common.
How much did the culture of Siberian seals differ and differ from that of motherland seals?
They are different, though what was brought here was never the same there.
They led to a great many folk ideas.
They then made their own (folk ideas), but they always made a distinction between what was involved and what was done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional clothes of the sethos, because here it is colder.
Food changed.
For example, Setomaal meat was salt, but here it was just frozen.
Where are the villages of the Siberian sethode and what life is there?/graphics: Alari Paluotis
Communication with motherland was mentally strong, it was considered to be very important.
It seems to me that now Setumaa is starting to give back there, starting to affect them.
These girls, who have lived in families here, have listened to amazing stories.
Piho is thinking of the people of the Estonian setode delegation who came to the village of Haida on Seto kingdom at the beginning of July and lived in four days' homes - J. P.
What is still here is fabulous.
"It is very easy to come and go away, too, because the city has an excellent location: at the railway hub and at the intersection of the highway," says the opera house from Tapego.
The city is no longer just a military capital; we have a lot of nature, sports and culture, and the seal gets on every corner.
Tapa is a top-grossing city!
There are small islands running through the city along the Belarus river, where ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary Janipur.
"There does not seem to be this beautiful place from the train window," mugs Reigo.
Whoever is not afraid of cold water can swim in this river because the river is full of sources.
I have been floating there, you can do it!
In the water of the river, you can keep a picnic and just do romance - you can see the flow of the river and think about life in advance and behind.
I have also been walking there with my bride.
From opera Tamm, on top of everything else, on the river, three bridges between its archipelago are practicing: 'that place is in the city, no one may have to come if.'
"There is a wonderful view of the mountain, but there are health professionals where you can run, ski in winter, and now, for example, play a discgolf course - the golf course is done,
The old prophets, of course, go there with their kettles, but I have not yet been able to play.
It is obvious that Mr Rasmus Kull will be invited to Taple because he is an experienced distributor and has a disk.
Va he lends me!
Reigo and the mountain of play were inseparable from the childhood times of the present operas.
At least during ski hours.
There have been a lot of tears left on this mountain, frustrations and you can in my sports life.
Not to mention broken bells and mouths.
"The entire central city is currently full of construction work, all of it becoming unfamiliar," praises Reigo.
The old and tired whale building, however, is a very attractive place to play summer discoveries.
I am pleased that in 2012 the leader of R.A.A.MI, Märt Meos, adopted my idea and had to make a brave summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with "Alexei Karen" has just been over, on 11 August the railway station will have a "life awakening" when the old whaling building is moving around the 1980s.
"Between 11 and 13 August, the days of the Tapa City have been followed by open cafes in the village building and cultural events are taking place, including the folk gallery," says Reigo.
In a tiny yellow lighthouse on the wooden path of May 1, the museum has been dating since 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are well many and information tremendously," boasts Reigo in a place full of Tapper City history, most of which focuses on rail and military.
Reigo mugs that if Tapal passes all the recommended sites, the abdomen will go empty long, but thankfully the small town is full of coffee.
"We have such good meals and when sitting in cafes you sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad," he describes.
Educated and young Tamil soldiers spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, while sitting there, there is a curious feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home town, but the circle is international.
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we are moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
Television channel BTV quoted the Foreign Ministry as reporting that two Bulgarians were taken into custody in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of 1 August, police arrested a group of people illegally camping in the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but an investigation is under way.
The Foreign Ministry told TV channel BTV that Bulgarians were later released.
Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone caught resting in a place that is not intended to do so.
The checks continue throughout the season.
The court could impose a fine, according to the ministry.
Puppies teach wolves attending sheep break.
Farmers in Hiiuan will have to give wolves' teaching material from their herd again after a year - the wolves who have taught puppies have already broken a lot of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu county have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and eight injured, writes Hiiu Leht.
The number was only three, up from 124 a year earlier.
With breakdowns in sync, environmental agency records also show that soil in Hiiumaa wolf baseball was not born and Hiiumaa hunting council info that two wolves have been fixed on the island this year.
On the night of Monday, wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Emmerdale, and injured 18 surviving sheep on the sides.
Early on Wednesday morning, wolves in the pasture of the village of Reheselja broke one sheep and badly injured another who had to be made an emergency kill.
Rules for handling GM crops must be clear
The Ministry of Land sent a draft amendment to the Plant Protection Act (GMAC) and the Plant Protection Act to the Coordinator.
The amendment to the law abandons the creation of a separate dataset for both GM (GM) crop locations and handlers to use the plant health registry.
In addition, the GM crop handler's obligation to have a prior agreement within the prescribed radius of the honeymoon will be amended.
Although GM crops are not currently cultivated in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and non-modified crops.
At least until the decision to declare Estonia GM-free, "Sigmar Suu Kyi, head of the plant health department at the Ministry of Agriculture, said.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures that have been developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden on both the private and public sectors," Suu Kyi added.
The draft law repealed provisions relating to the training and handling of GM crop locations and handlers by GM, establishes requirements for handling GM crops and commencing economic activities.
Specifically with regard to beekeeping, the GM crop farmer's current obligation to inform beekeepers of the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before starting growing the GM crop.
The Bill has been sent to co-ordinate ministries.
All interested parties will have the opportunity to access the draft information system and, if they so wish, to give their opinion to the Ministry of the Interior.
The proposed changes will affect in particular those active in the field of plant farming, beekeepers and the Agriculture Agency.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop has been allowed to grow - maize MON 810.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing the GM crop.
The reason is that there are no corn reefs in Estonia, the European reserve, for which the corn line MON 810 is resistant.
Varieties of this corn line have also been bred to southern regions and this May is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In order to obtain certainty, the Ministry of Rural Affairs commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 on possible GM organisms to detect pollution in the seeds of different summer rays, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia.
The analysis of samples taken showed that seeds did not contain the alien gene, and the study concluded that seeds of rapeseed, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it may be concluded that GM crops are not deliberately cultivated in Estonia, and it was also confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruit Nemanja Maticu in form of 'genius'
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited Nemanja Matilu in the form of a "genius" after midfield player Sampdoria made their debut on Wednesday night.
A player bought for £40 million from Chelsea started at Dublin Unite in the last seasonal match before Uefa's Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday with a 2-1 victory in the All-Star defence
But having been sidelined by the Blues' pre-season Asian development, Maticul desperately needed a match form and he held against for only 45 minutes. This must be corrected, according to Mourinho.
"He needs time but he has experience, intelligence, an ingenious way of thinking - he has a football mentality," Mourinho said.
"We will help him achieve form at the earliest opportunity."
Like Matic, other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho began to quietly put his starting man in uniform for the start of the season.
The Independent disclosed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed the club had already done an "excellent job" in concluding contracts with three of his four priority options.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three of the four," he added.
"I am still happier if they can make a run of four, but they have worked hard for me."
Another sex son got a leg on the side of the GSM-transmitter on 1 August and this time in Muhus.
Mati Martinson, a living bird observer, became the first son of a transmitter equipped with the Ring and this baseball team is already flying around, has left the baseball field and joined the Big Bay.
This is because the Ring is not the fruit of the trees, says Saarte Voice.
On this Tuesday, to ring the cucumbers early relatively late, another Courier-Mail and this Muhu island became attached.
According to Martinson, the installation of the transmitters is actually an international project vetted by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojas.
The soil was supplied by a guesson called Mati GSM-transmitter in the Ring Turbo.
"His actions are all on the Internet: how he went to winter in Spain, coming back a long time on the German and Polish border and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
British inventor allowed to install a microchip into his own body to access a hand-held house and car
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be installed on a microchip so that he can only open his front door, access the office and even run a car.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam was able to install a tiny chip between his thumb and naming finger and now offers this service through his company Bioteq to companies and individuals seeking to make their lives easier.
He has joined forces with Winchester Hospital's Hampshire County Royal Hospital consultant anesthesiologist Dr Geoff Watson to ensure compliance with medical standards for the installation procedure.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip installed on cats and dogs, and the procedure takes just 30 seconds.
The Northampton company will also swap locks of houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, asking for £300 for one lock.
This married father of one child has installed the technology now both at home and in his car at the BMW Z4, which will run when he hands on the wheel.
White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands
According to military documents made public by Time magazine TIME, the White House decision to fly a Navy helicopter to a southern courthouse last month for an American production event cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The green and white color of Sikorsky VH-3D, called Marine One during the presidential pardon, was central to the event showcasing American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
Senior officials in President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and the White House newsreporters at their circuit of industrial products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, built in Connecticut, was exhibited jointly by a hunt from Madeleine, a fire truck coming from Wisconsin and a two-alarm made from Missippi.
According to the documents responsible for the operation of the helicopter, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House asked for an unusual half-hour for an emergency helicopter
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually high-attention event," the HMX-1 commander said the day before the event in an e-mail to his superior, the Navy's deputy.
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the southern yard on the morning of July 17 at 7 a.m. for an event starting at 15 a.m. and remain there until the shuttle is cleared between 6 p.m. and 21 p.m. on the same night.
Added was the fact that, should the White House leave, a second ekipathy is needed because of restrictions on working time.
The original flight crew was on a helicopter at the time of the event, and the Squadron security team remained near the aircraft throughout the time of its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to read out the documents given to the magazine TIME whether or not the second ekipaji was eventually needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether a given event might violate that provision.
"We asked if it violated the Hatch Act, and we were told not to violate it," the commander wrote.
"It seems you have no choice," the chief officer's deputy responded.
The White House declared the event an "American-made" official event and the Hatch Act would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The president backed the sponsors of health care reform during the Senate debate at the time and praised efforts to keep government regulations in check.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically lucrative purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
But the requirement to use them purely as a photoscreen is unusual.
Trump got into the spotlight in February when at his first campaign event in Florida in Melbourne a watershed backdrop to the president's plane, and he Twitter account tweeted messages about how his predecessor used it
"The White House is very pleased with the excerpt of 'American-made' products from all 50 states prepared by American materials workers," White House spokeswoman Amanda Lindsay said.
HMX-1 teams often carry test flights around Washington and in the southern courtyard to practice the deposition of the President of the United States to the White House with inch accuracy.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, the HMX-1 White House boasted 58 samples landing.
According to the official, the flight to the event was thought to be "American-made" by the flight crew to be the norm for monthly tuition flights.
The Squadron helicopters were flying an additional 11 hours for "unrelated support missions" with the president that day.
The White House said no other exhibition of the event was loaded with taxpayer purses.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in organising the exhibition in the southern yard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget documents on the president's flights, and the exact cost of the event is difficult to figure out.
But according to the Department of Defense's 2017 hourly prices, the VH-3D compensation rate is 24 380 dollars per flight hour.
The crash documents noted the length of the flight from its main base at the Navy Quantico Airport from Virginia on both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House argues that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount.
"Calculating taxpayers' costs based on estimated compensation rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated compensation rates include staffing, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that will be taken into account in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RANDS study, Defense Department compensation rates do not include personnel costs, though they cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
White House former spokeswoman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the time at the event.
"The point of the matter is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that the State of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security and that there are expected to be hundreds, if not even thousands, of people whose work depends on it
And I believe, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it is right to highlight this. "
It is unclear whether Trump was in touch with a helicopter or not in the southern yard as part of the event, but he sat behind the wheel of the fire car.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, throwing fun at media outlets over the company's products at his personal aircraft park.
"I feel Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - through tears arrived for peace and joy
The 2011 Mil Daegus hit the final area of Switzerland with an 800 m drinking foot ramp and the stadium was dragged away with a canal.
Just before that, he had received a cuddle of distance from the universe held in China.
The 2012 Helsinki EMI breached a cheapie injury but, in London, he gained 23rd place with 6013 points.
Misfortune, however, continued.
After the opening day of the 2013 Moscow Mile, Estonia's record in the PGA Championship had a thumb injury.
Two years later, he gained 15th place on the Beijing Mile and filled the Olympic torch, but that was more than a disappointment for the athlete.
The heaviest cadalipu went through Switzerland only in the soil when, at the beginning of Amsterdam, the EM did not receive a letter.
I would just like to put together a proper multi-competition one time.
Once, 'Spray Šadeiko.
Worse still was ahead: a month later, his Olympic contest in Rio was interrupted by a delay in the first hurdle.
Time had to be taken down - can seven competitions go ahead?
Is two days of effort still worth all this?
They thought long but they found peace.
I got a head cleanse thinking
It is relatively difficult to describe that experience, but I have thought last season and the Rio Olympics were something like that just had to happen.
Luckily, there was time to heal and think of the head cleanse.
"I knew that I would not put a bag yet," says Sadeiko of his self-cleaning.
I was able to turn a clean sheet and go on with the new momentum.
Coach Anne Mountain said the suffering of the carer was very difficult to watch, but she realized that, above all, the athlete had to clear herself.
He was, after all, so suppressed.
It was hard to tolerate.
"Grit, however, said he does not give up and he wants to prove to himself what it is worth," says Mountain.
Now there is some sort of peace in him.
He does it for his own joy.
The winning streak came back in May, when Šadeiko erected a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the Götz multi-competition.
In a high-profile competition, he improved the personal top mark with a bullet boost by nearly a metre (13.89) and ran the barrier of record time.
Then the multi-contestant felt that this was not a ceiling of ability, but that only the first hunger for competition was deleted.
He has been instructed by Mountain View for years to say that Saiko is a black student.
He is a willing athlete, he is good to train.
If something makes trouble or is wrong, he says it immediately.
He is feeling his own body and trusting his sense.
That is what we need to do.
I cannot say exactly what needs to be done and we will follow it.
A new approach has also been found in Switzerland.
"I am not the one who makes the maximum in the trench," he says and says that the most important thing is getting the right feeling, because it also guarantees a good result.
Close baby happiness makes for joy
Good emotions have also been offered to Switzerland by the happiness of loved ones.
Both his former training companion Maris Mountain and sister Grete became parents recently, and the multi-contestant has received support from new weather citizens.
"Pretty interesting it is been," spells the sheiko.
One alcohol whose drinking equals brain 'training'.
LiveStrong writes that Dr Gordon Shopperd is a superstar so great a wine fan that believes - wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Shopperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
It is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but instead about the "very active" process of wine tasting.
By smelling the glass, scheming the wine in the mouth, enjoying it and sensing the aftertaste, we put our brain to work to create a taste for wine.
According to Shopperdi, wine molecules do not really contain flavor, but the flavor arises from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He brings a comparison of how the brain "sees" colors.
"Taste is not in wine, taste creates wine tasty," says Shopperd.
Things that still affect the appearance of wine taste are, for example, our age, sex and even the amount of salt that a person produces.
Shperd, of course, admonishes that wine is not in order to drink full.
"There has to be more action," he says.
If you take too big a limp, the system is oversaturated.
Excessive drinking of wine can harm the brain instead of benefits - according to a 2004 study, people drinking over three glasses of wine, memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity.
10% of workers in the ICT sector in Estonia earn less than their counterparts
Data from staff search company Fontes reveals that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than their counterparts.
The 10 per cent pay gap is between men and women, writes portal Genevieve.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the Fontese ICT sector pay survey.
A total of 8 577 posts were under observation.
63% of posts were employed by men.
"Although only 3 companies said that the pay gap was in favour of men and that the rest of the companies had no pay gap, in reality, compared similar works with each other, men's monthly basic pay is on average 10% higher than men's."
"Narcos" 3rd season advertising clip: now that Pablo Escobar is gone, Netflix's hipster takes centre stage at Cal cartel
Despite being exposed in the second season of "Narcos" by the killer of Pablo Escobar, the Netflix series is far from complete.
The third and fourth seasons have been validated by the streaming service, and the first has already been produced in a promotional clip, which detects a series of new pastries.
In the third season, the DEA is turning its attention to the world's richest drug company - the Cal cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful crusaders "like the Fortune 500 company," just with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) of Mexico
The newly minted advertising clip sees Pedro Pascali return to Javier Penana, a figure who recruits American and Colombian law enforcement to help in the war against drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishop and Arturo Castro.
"Narcos" third season gets the opening bang on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on women's role in politics
The head of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday that elections can only represent the nation if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said hundreds of women were standing in local council elections, three women standing as vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate the role of women by highlighting the importance of the role," she said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can be truly representative of the people and can only be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
Elections and presidential elections are due in Afghanistan's local councils on April 5.
For its part, the Taliban have threatened an electoral process that coincides with a period of transition when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time that power will be transferred calmly from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said the strong role of women will enhance the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
Of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women, according to Afghanistan's Independent Electoral Commission.
The joy of sharing makes every thing fierce both big and small.
There is always too little common time, but the trench with the pings provides a good opportunity to combine meeting, game, proximity and load.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you cruise in the summer, the live tout always comes with you, and impatiently remind you of your fine voice: 'we now make a trench too!'
Start with the warm-up - very good is the usual golden game or along the beach bar flipping.
The plough is a mainstay of legs and dusty form - who would you like to take shape in the sandbag from the waves during the summer?
It is wonderful to use chicken instead of children!
First of all, it is safe and comfortable, with the difficulty growing slowly at the same pace as a trainer's force.
You can also make fun of real children.
The child train the balance, reads the repetitions and feels the chance to have a high beer and an important one.
Bigger kids can make their own heating at the same time.
The scale of the movement put in place by touching the ground and sipping hands.
Keep your fingers straight, beam the miniaturistic to hold up properly.
The child can read the repetitions and feel like a coach.
Plank is an ubiquitous but hopelessly boring exercise for a child.
But it is easy to make fun of!
Game-plank: take a long plangun from which to fold through.
In fact, it is more difficult than usual, but much more fun to do if, in the meantime, a friend can hand in.
In order to add to the load, you can stay on the plate, and walk around in that position.
An extra difficulty can be put in a stick to a child's hip, but this exercise offers fun for all children.
While crabs sift in the sand, stripes, tubes and abdominal muscles get a strain as contagious.
The child gets to his feet in such a way that his body weight is distributed equally in advance and behind.
For security, hands can be held.
Curve the legs and sift straight up.
You can fly, have fun, train the balance and be in difficulty.
The life of a little coaches is extra when he gets a little buzz every upstairs.
The extra load gives the legs a sighting in advance.
Check that the back stays in a neutral position.
The children themselves have a lot of fun to make with a pair and a plaque.
Toilet work and pulse cuff.
Trace the child's safety, knee position, and hold back in a neutral position.
Everyone's favourite and great fun!
For a parent while truly effective throughout the body trench.
Sports tools were Ott (10), Shell (8), Laird (4).
A trip to the heart of the fashion fans from the Philippines to the wider world, a vet bag
The bread bags are a summer classic, which has become a hi-product in its own right in recent years, which one right-handler has to hang at the end of his hand and has been cooked by traders.
The pumped bag of the shoulders is probably one of the things that has existed in the life of the guild once and which has not generated any particular emotion.
It just exists and if there is not, there is nothing broken either.
Now, however, shoulder bags are making a real victory, and fashion fans have switched their fine designer bags from simple shoulders to bundled bags for summer months instead.
It is not just a beach bag, but today it is just as popular as a street bag, and even bolder women walk into the office.
At this point, however, it is worth explaining before you whether a summer creek of this kind is still sitting or worth a tag and a laptop to push a little more official.
However, the altercation has made a real summer love for women from the shoulders.
For example, by counting foreign fashion logs, the first thing is to keep an eye on the fashion gurns when travelling on holiday to the local market and buying a few beer bags, the truffle.
Some bloggers are downright so generous that they buy bags from the market for a larger pile and sell or give away them to their loyal readers.
In doing so, it is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so great that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go to each other in order to become happy owners of some bags.
In some ways, this madness is also understandable, because it is rare to have these times when, in fashion, it is possible to buy some of the things that have gone up in hitchhiking.
It is true that cavalier merchants have also discovered a simple way of earning money, and so the finer luxury brands are selling straw bags for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Apparently, the richer customers should not feel like a butcher who prowls around with cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana for over a thousand euros a payment for a shoulder bag.
Chanel's shoulder bag interpretation, however, can be rolled out in the round of 6000 euros.
Unlike most motels, however, shoulderbags do not inherit any of the great fashion meteors, but their story got off to quite a distance.
Indeed, they are said to be far from the Philippines, from which they have been wearing large weather.
The pudding of the straw bag is primarily an export business and the locals are very often not seen running around with them.
Arguably, the oilseed technique dates back to the 14th century and is quite similar to the normal basket.
However, since the shoulder bag does not have to be as heavily pumped as the basket, they can be infused with patterns and other materials that make the bag more personal and also more actualized by it.
Recently, for example, there have been particularly trendy bags with red coloured paws or leather shoes.
However, thanks to the letter of thanks, the shoulders could primarily be sent to the actor Jane Birkin, the biggest punched shoulder fan not seen before.
Namely, she matched her shoulder bag to all kinds of clothing sets and did not even have to go much further to the Cannes film festival.
The popularity of bags today does not play any smaller role, but also that caring for them is a cockpit and, unlike any other mustaches, they do not have to be towed by special means, and water drives away.
As in the case of trench robberies still, brands that come after classical appearance have come up with all kinds of interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you can buy a blended dress or a tiny straw bag.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that a classic shoulder bag will never go out of fashion, but it does.
But what's the classic shoulder bag then?
For centuries, the classic has been regarded as the kind of stuffed bag of shoulders that resembles a basket of its styles, open and short, as well as shoulders, spiders.

GMB worries about investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The trade union is awaiting confirmation from cookmaker McVitie's executives on long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent on the future of Tollcross's object investment.
The plant, which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
The company's McVitie owner, Pladis, said they had invested in the item in the last few years for more than £5 million.
Workers were hired there, and union chairmen "are the first to hear" if anything changes in factory activity.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB contacted Scott McVitie's company with a request to "disclose concerns that the funding will not be used to modernise production lines."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "the fact that we are not getting clarity from the chief executive of the item on Tollcross's business needs and future investment plan is deeply worrying our members.
Many generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is made up largely of the local community and people around Glasgow, a vital pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social weather.
So, in terms of jobs, wages and welfare in the East of Glasgow, and in the context of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic decline in production, the company that is thriving needs McVitie. "
A record spokesman said: "Tollcross site manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will respond directly to him as we value active communication with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting was held in Tollcroft between workers and GMB representatives, which openly discussed a number of problems.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all the other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on the ground - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "in recent years we have invested over £5 million in Tollcross's item, most of it has gone to production lines and improvements to operations.
We fully understand Tollcross's legacy as a production site, and if there should be any change in the activity of the object, the workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it. "
Did PSG warn Barcelona against approaching Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up in an effort to lure Neymar into their ranks by making an offer of £189 million to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record capture?
This hard-headed approach has opened the summer transfer window and the Ligue 1 club are poised to crush more than double the overbuying of the current world record set last season by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United.
Once the transition is complete, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player as a result, and also the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, who will be paid over £500,000 a week after taxes from PSGP.
Barcelona are known to be angry at both the approach and the free break for Neymar, although a source close to Catalansi's board confirms that the club has been looking after the footballer since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi strongly warned all clubs thinking about recruiting some of PSG's best players.
"I am not worried because they know that if they concern some of our players, we will confront them and contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to contract with some of our players, they have to face the consequences. "
Barcelona appear to have taken over from that limit as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfield player Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they will not let Italia leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could get a rebound as a result of that interest by losing Neymar in the form of one of their expensive assets.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit.
"Brexit threatens to severely capture the wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.
"I cannot imagine who would benefit from this," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods, Varadkar said.
"It is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders," he stressed.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and because it is not going to be able to remain part of the European single market.
This would maintain current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the UK, the Irish prime minister explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "certainly we could have this kind of Britain."
The alternative to this would be a return to customs points that would herald a historic split and political failure.
"Barrier to trade, prosperity and peace," the Irish Prime Minister said.
He called Brexit "a challenge for our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Irish daily life.
The Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland during a visit to Belfast.
With its first half-long triathlon passed by Märt Avandi: Ironman's can pass everyone.
Today, the biggest triathlon festival was held in the winter capital Otesail in Baltimore, when around a thousand triathlons from more than three out of ten countries entered the competition.
The 70.3 miles distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of wheeling and 21.1 km of racing.
Among others, the victorious ended his life with the first triathlon also featuring Märt Avandi.
"I thought it would be difficult and ultimately it was difficult," said Avandi.
Despite the complexity of the truth about Avandi, in fact, the triathlon is a powerless head for all.
"Not the distance will kill, but the pace will kill," he said, alluding to the heavyweight pace reaching the finish line for the head of everyone.
Except Ott Sepp: "with Oti's physique, everything is fine, but alas, he cannot swim."
Avandi had been aggressively trench done as early as February.
At the beginning 4-5 hours a week, however, ten hours a week later.
Time 05: 34: 12 he gained 270th place in the overall count.
While Avandi lost both to Raio Piirja (time 04: 59: 53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05: 06: 37), he won other so-called "class of pros."
Tanel Padar, who was "good example" last year, lost to Avant in seven minutes (time 05: 41: 54), journalist Sten Teppan 16 minutes (time 05: 50 hours), Kalev
The overall winner of the men's record in the Otepää stage of the Ironman Series was crowned German John Moldan with 3: 58: 27, the Estonians had the best Ivo Great with 04: 14: 09.
Among the women, Dane Helle Frederiksen won with 04: 24: 01, but Maria Jänes lost to Frederiksen by nearly half an hour and was given a time of 04: 58.
Avandi went through a 1.9 km distance with 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
Out of the water, he came in 410th position.
