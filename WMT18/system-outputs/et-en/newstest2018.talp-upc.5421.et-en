Four members of the Kemerovo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the Postist, the police in Spain detained the so-called Kemerovo group leader in the Estonian underground system, Slava Gulakoski, who is known in the criminal world as' Slava Kemerovsky '.
Mr Gusevah, detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of a court.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects in Estonia.
The suspicion is that these are members of the so-called 'Kemerovo criminal community' between the ages of 27 and 57, who are mainly involved in drug crimes.
In Spain, in Mijas, the alleged head of the criminal community was detained.
Three men were detained as suspects in Estonia, one of them being the leading figure of a criminal association, according to the data collected, and two are members of a criminal association.
The data collected indicates that the tasks and roles of the criminal community were clearly divided.
The purpose of the criminal community's activities was to commit drug crimes and thereby generate criminal revenue, "commented the head of pre-trial proceedings in a criminal case, the public prosecutor Vahur verte.
"We do not exclude that the circle of suspects in this criminal case will increase," added the prosecutor.
These are people who have in the past been put into the custody of law enforcement agencies and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Ms Verte stressed that cooperation with our Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become the norm for us, and this week's operation is a success story," the prosecutor commented.
Ago leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Office, said that the arrests were preceded by an investigation lasting almost one and a half years.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work became a reality and at the same time we detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Bread added that officials of the Central Civil Police were helping with detention in Spain.
For years, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These arrests are another message to criminals that we will also get them from another end of Europe, "said the bread.
The information collected so far clearly indicates that suspected men may continue to commit new crimes while at large, which is why the prosecution service requested their arrest and the court approved it.
The man arrested in Spain is awaiting his surrender to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash seized have been seized in the context of this criminal case in order to ensure confiscation.
Pre-trial criminal proceedings are conducted by the office of organised crime committed by the central criminal police and run by the public prosecutor's office.
In 2005, the Tallinn Town Court convicted of blackmail and punished him with a five-year prison sentence.
In the middle of last decade, Gulevich was seen as the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world, after Nikolai Tarankov, the then leader of the alliance.
In the beginning of the 1990s, the Estonian model emerged from Gulevich, who came from Kemerovo, when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes from different hotels and demanded monthly price from the businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscation of criminal assets and the entry into force of judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the most recent sentences, the so-called "Dickayev" eight accused persons who had been confiscated €80 000 in criminal proceeds, or the Court's conviction of nine persons that Igor Aleynikov had set up a criminal association in 2006 to commit illegal trade and illegal crimes in Estonia involving human trafficking in the trade and illegal trade in the South.
The amount of criminal proceeds confiscated there is almost EUR 71 500.
In these criminal cases, it has been a success that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign offices every day for evidence and, if necessary, carry out joint operations in any country of the European Union.
Civil Rights Group warns Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state.
The Group's statement reads: 'The NAACP travel note issued by the State of Missouri, applicable until 28 August 2017, calls on all African Americans, visitors and missionaries to be particularly attentive and racial to the most recent and extremely suspicious events'.
The NAAP said that the group was urged to issue a travel warning, both through the recent Missouri Law, which makes it more difficult to win cases concerning discrimination, and by the fact that the aims of state law enforcement agencies are, to an equal extent, minorities.
"Citizens' rights are being violated.
They are pulled because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said Rod Chapel, President of NAACP Missouri, to the Kansas City Star.
'We have never before received such complaints. '
It is the first such warning issued by an organisation about a US state.
The group referred to events such as the death of the racist insulting black students at Missouri University and the 28-year-old black storm Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year after he had run out of the state and had been arrested by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the remark refers to a recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri, which shows that in the state, black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped than white-skinned cars.
"The note is designed to make people aware of and warn their families, friends and colleagues of what may happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People need to be ready, whether that means taking the money in cash or informing relatives that they are going through the state."
Based on the most recent data from the FBI's hate crime information programme, 100 hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, which ranked 16th across the country in terms of the number of similar offences in the state.
Travel warnings are also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for a company to be prosecuted for seeking accommodation or work because of discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Community, ACLU had issued travel remarks about Texas and Arizona after these states adopted immigration laws that obliged the local people to guard against immigration on grounds of race.
Normally, travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries, but recently interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain internal US laws and trends.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about the various forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or hepatitis, can be caused by five different types of hepatitis A, B, C, D and E.
All of these viruses give rise to liver disease in acute inflammation.
However, the burden of blood pressure is chronic hepatitis B and C, which can develop into cirrhosis of the liver, that is to say the liver and liver cancer.
The Office of Epidemiology Advisor, Kulo itch, naur, vomiting, diarrhoeal pain, joint inflammation of the liver, musculoskeletal fever, musculoskeletal skeletal disorders, musculoskeletal disorders and pancreas.
The last characteristic of the disease is also the common name of liver inflammation, yellow fever.
In children, hepatitis can be transmitted through disease.
Different types of payment can be determined only on the basis of laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can be transferred to chronic hepatitis and progress for decades without disease, meaning that people may not know anything about their dangerous liver disease.
The lunar itcher highlights various forms of hepatitis and describes their progress more closely.
The hepatitis A virus spreads ill from humans and infects us when eating or drinking water contaminated, by sex, by throwing the infected person out to the hands and hands of food, surfaces, items, mouth and drug consumption.
The risk group of a hepatitis infection includes family members and carers, people suffering from chronic liver diseases, people having sex with the infected, men having sex, drug users, travellers to countries with a high level of hepatitis A.
Infections can be prevented by vaccination, in particular, for frequent travellers and people at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: Wash or disinfect a hand, before eating all fruit and vegetables.
Hepatitis B viruses spread in contact with the blood of the sick person, through drug injections, tattooing, inhalation, blood-contaminated male (toothbrushes, contraception) and the use of donor blood transfusions, hepatitis 2 from the foetus and foetus.
The risk group for hepatitis B includes injections of drug users, sex partners of the infected person, sex partners of men, newborn babies of the infected mother, sick family members and carers, health workers with blood and other body fluids, and patients with hepatitis B.
To prevent hepatitis B, vaccination of people is possible; in particular, it is recommended that people at risk be vaccinated, as well as those suffering from chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
B. prevention measures for hepatitis A: Refrain from using foreign hygiene and manipulative devices, other sharp devices and syringes, tattoos and needles-witchcraft, and use of condoms to prevent infection or sexual risk.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immune system in Estonia and free of charge for children.
Hepatitis c viruses spread in contact with the blood of the sick person, through drug injections, tattooing, August, use of blood-contaminated older blood cells, donor water, hepatitis suspicious person, and foetal childhood.
The risk group for hepatitis c infection includes injections of drug users, sex partners of the infected person, sex partners of men, newborn babies of the infected mother, sick family members and carers, health workers and other body fluids who are exposed to HIV, rescue workers and high-infected patients.
C hepatitis is a preventive measure: Refrain from using foreign hygiene and manipulators, other sharp instruments, and syringes, tattoos and needles in the event of infection.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis c.
D hepatitis causes the hepatitis D virus, which is multiplied by B hepatitis in the presence of the virus.
Because of this, hepatitis D infection occurs together with hepatitis B or as a super infection for chronic hepatitis B sufferers.
Hepatitis D viruses spread through contact with blood and other body fluids, contaminated with syringes, sexually transmitted by the mother from rarely infected foetuses.
Chronic hepatitis B virus groups and people who are not immune to hepatitis B.
Effective prevention is vaccination with a B hepatitis vaccine, which also protects people from the infection by the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses are transmitted by fecal and oral drinking water and food, including the feeding of heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, donors, common injections and infected mothers.
Travellers in countries with high levels of hepatitis E can be infected.
The prevention measures for hepatitis E are compliance with hygiene requirements: Wash or disinfect hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the patient.
Fruit and vegetables are washed before consumption, poorly treated beef, fish and seafood are eaten, only safe drinking water is consumed and drug consumption is avoided.
Although competitors tried to pull the Olympic winner four times in the last round, the 34-year-old Farah found power in the final straight and won the 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long, pulling his wife, the children, along with him after the finish.
This was a special moment for me.
Miss your family very much.
It was wonderful to be on the road with them, "said Farah's journalists.
Farah targets a total of 5,000 and 10,000 metres of golden leave in London for the fifth title.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
In spite of the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor 'lady of gold is diving.
But even more deeply in history.
In other words, the harshest cut-price theme would allow the gate to gain more influence on the exceptional story promised in the title.
At the moment, there would be two books between one Khant: The story of Gustav Klimt and his' lady of gold 'on the painting of Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a much more voluminous and wide-ranging history-ranging respected villages and the German occupation of Austria.
The first third of the book takes the cultural life of Vienna in the midst of a powder keg, and those who were themselves in the capital of Austria can hardly imagine how life went around Ringstra more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone turned their heads in the Central café.
The concentration of cultural characters was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and seeing their name familiar in the book, they feel as if they were more cultured than grams.
At the same time, the fact that Sigmund Freud was in a town with an incurable syphilis and the highest levels of suicide in Europe is, for example, a factor in development as if it does not add anything.
Or perhaps, however, every two-year brush stroke adds colours to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
During the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had increased exponentially, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century almost every tenth resident of Vienna was a Jew.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice to the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and Klimtil, for his famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele did not pull out all the glamorous life to which he belonged.
When you look at 'David's gold', it is hard to believe that towards the end of life this great lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of travelling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his wife's portrait from Klimt, was the last minute the hottest painter in Vienna.
At that time, the Klimti order cost 4000 kroons, a quarter of the price of a well-located country.
The fact that in some stairs the master's show was suspected of having a machine for love, the sugar magnate was not discouraged.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist that emerged during the work continued throughout the life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "lady with gold.
Gustav Klimti masterpiece, an extraordinary story of the Adele Bloch-Bauer portrait, "Varrak 2016, from English translated by Aldo Randma.
Just before the start of the work with Adelge, Klimt had been to Ravennas San Vitale's basilic, and the researchers think that it was there that the brilliant mosaics of Emperor Theodora gave the artist the idea of the golden gate of Adele.
Kliment presented his "David gold" in Vienna in 1908 and at about the same time (in 1907-1908) another golden land was born "kissing."
The similarity of the two women did not go unnoticed in the art historians.
How is Hitler involved in the story?
"I think I owe it to my friend Klimt to make his work available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) to the Director of the Belvere Museum and asked their family to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, the Kliment had completed the Adele.
Also in his will (Adele left in February 1925) he asked that his wife leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscape painting to Austrian Gallery.
His jewellery bequeathed to his sisters Maria and Luisa.
One year after Klimt had graduated from the "Austrian Mona Lisa," attempts had been made to enter the Kauniste Academy of Arts in Vienna at the age of 17, Adolf Hitler, but failed in drawing it up.
Although it is sometimes considered that Hitler's later anti-Semitism was caused by the fact that he was not received by Jewish professors at the Academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery referred to in Maria will have changed considerably by 1939 - the important thing was to find pleasant works for the Nazi party from the rich Jewish collections of Vienna.
Hitler's personal art store was also suited to the work of Adele at home, but not of the Klimt.
Sixty years after the Nazi arts robbery started a ten-year legal dispute between the Austrian Government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauer.
I would just like to point out that if the 'ski' looks at the Belvedere castle in Vienna, Adele Bloch-Bauer will look at a trip to New York Neue Gallery.
And before the trip to Vienna, read the aforementioned book.
Even when you Klimti's works to look at go on no plan, because at least my emotions revolved after the book was closed more by the Nazi and Jewish mother than the USD 135 million sold paint and the model Adel Bloch-Bauer around.
So not so much a portrait as a race as a destiny - a very moving story.
The Bauer family tree presented at the beginning of the book facilitated the orientation of events.
17 year old swimming in Canada was very close to the Estonian record
In the early days, Gold was about 200 m of its own making, swimming very close to a personal record of 2.16.62.
The Tipppmark dates back to the 17-year old Silicon blog, which was awarded 2.16.58 for the June championship in Canada, is being circulated by Priit for the Aauje blog.
Gold reached the final, the tenth A-finale.
In the final, he passed through a distance of 2.15.76 and won a good seventh place with a powerful top mark.
Alina Kendziori's Estonian record (2.15.13) left the mark of the Golden in just over half a second.
In the top ranking of all Estonian times, Gold rose to the third, and his fresh personal tip is the fifth result of all Estonian times.
The young hope for the future is still starting in a 100 m, 200 m and 400 m free and 200 m and 400 m complex in the Canadian adult championship.
Last week in Toronto, Canada, there was a competition for June and gold made a successful start there too.
He won 200 m in freedom from silver medal time 2.03.22.
This was the speed with which it was most recently swimming in 2008.
Throughout the ages, only the Estonian record-levels Elina Partõka have flooded this distance in Estonia.
The Estonian woman living in Canada won a further bronze point in her freedom with an excellent personal record and a top mark of 56.66 in the new Estonian season.
For example, his year older Kertu Ly Alnek has this distance floating only one century faster.
He reached a further 100 m in the spell of his personal top mark by getting a theatre performance in the opening exchange of a letter of 1.03.69.
On a longer distance, he only obtained the seventh position, when he flooded the final 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the ranking for the Estonian season on four different fronts.
President Trump goes on holiday, critics sharpen their teeth
The time for holidays is now - it also means relaxation for the US President, Donald Trump.
However, as Trump has so far been one of the President's most important days off, the critics are already sharpening their teeth.
On the announcement of US day and CNN, the President plans a 17-day holiday to spend in his own-time golf club Bed's, in New Jersey.
Although the President's holiday began yesterday, the truer opponents have spoken about leave for a week.
They cast too frequent rest before Trump.
Namely, the President has a custom to spend the weekend on his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey wool.
By the way, Trump was not the most rested president during his 196 official days.
For example, George W. Bush had already been on holiday for 67 days, Barack Obama being half less than Trump, in just 21 days.
The Trump does seem to be quickly forgotten.
The counted days after becoming President said Trump, sending '60 minutes' so that the long holidays his agent does not leave time, because a great deal needs to be done.
He also expressed outrage three years ago at Barack Obama's leave.
The current President wrote on Twitter at the time: 'While Obama is on holiday, he is playing golf, attending celebrations and juries, ISIS journalists are up in arms'.
According to the White House officials, a 17-day visit to a golf club is not really a relaxation.
It is officially called a job pride during which Trump does not have time for reading or for any other kind of liking.
In addition, the job pride had to have another reason.
Indeed, the Western air conditioning system in the White House has been replaced and all the staff therefore had to leave.
There is also the Ovalbinet and other working premises of the president.
'i do not think that any of you would like to be in the west in August when there are 38 degrees and no air conditioning ', said the White House spokesman Lindsay, who stressed that the President would continue working during the holiday.
Where President Trump spends his next 17 days, you will get an idea of the video.
Blocking critics on Facebook\ 15; do not stand for election to the state office unless you tolerate the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew many things about unfavourable media coverage.
George Washington was loved by the Americans, but it did not take long for the newspapers to start harassing him for everything, from domestic politics to political principles.
The criticism, of course, annoyed him.
But he did not force his critics to remain silent.
Because in 1783 Washington said that 'freedom of expression could be taken away from us, and that in a darker and quiet way we could be led to massacres by the sheep'.
This brings me to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who must work hard to be more Washington-style.
Hogan people have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took him to court.
The Governor's officials stuffed the action empty, and the comments on the web crammed away in the style of 'Who cares?'.
"It's just Facebook," said many.
But it does matter.
And this counts especially when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an amazingly popular Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state.
His acceptance percentage is the second highest among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not thoughtfully reacting.
He has led the state with great determination and he has been firm in his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool in his dealings with his voters, presenting, for example, the head of a chemist for the first time after a chemist.
Therefore, the Governor's page, which is a public forum, officially labelled, managed by staff who earn taxpayers' dollars, the blocking of people who are visiting is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's press officer, Amelia Chasse, defended The Washington Post in an interview given the Governor's behaviour, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than modulation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of the online trolley, spam or hate-filled people.
The Post talked with several real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that's exactly what they are \150); real people who communicate with their chosen leaders. Teacher, owner of the company and pastor, not online trollers.
They all said that their comments were respectful, considered, and by no means rum.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, putting Hogan on the Catholic Church.
A lawyer from Maryland Bowie, Sarma Raman, was not fomenting hatred, but rather hate crimes.
"I commented politely that I am disappointed because he has not reacted to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in the commentary on The Post News.
'i also do not like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same subject, some will call it a collective effort rather than admitting that it is a great deal of concern to citizens. '
What the Governor's official called a 'targeted spam' incident, others would probably call 'public support'.
The Facebook era allows us to easily match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than it was in the past when workers had to be expelled to do the same, to collect and burn down critical newspaper headlines or to arrest the protesters and to force them to silence.
But that is exactly what is happening now, simply digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for rendering Facebook and other social media toothless.
The President has sued Twitter users who are blocked from Twitter's flow.
One of the first sentences of symbolic significance on this subject were handed down last week in Virginia.
The US District Court James C. Cacheris decided in Alexandria that the chairman of the board of supervisors of the Loudoun county violated the first amendment of the constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
Kentuckys visited ACLU for the use of Facebook and Twitter by Governor Matt Bevinit (R).
It should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, affordable postal costs had the same effect as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800 times the number of newspapers and the anonymous writers clashed over his manner of running.
And even then Washington had to deal with anonymous trawls.
People wrote letters to newspapers from pseudonyms such as Yuricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington decisions underground.
According to the historical documents compiled as part of the web-based project to collect letters from George Washington, his cabinet was buried under petitions criticising his views on the friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he did not force them to remain silent.
Freedom of expression, disagreement and debate are the foundation of our country.
And correct management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for convenience in the Renaissance Club
The former European premier Ronan Rafferty hopes for the convenience of his home territory over the next three days when the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf course takes place in the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who was in the vicinity of Archherfield in Links last year leading the road ahead of Paul Eales downfall, is attached to the new event and takes on the role of ambassador instead of founder and CEO Jerry Sarvade.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we can see the club kicking in full the brilliance of this event," said Rafferty.
"Players see the path in their best form, it's in a brilliant position.
Jerry has done an excellent job in establishing this place.
He is an enthusiastic supporter of the golf game and takes pride in what has been achieved here.
This allows you to present the track perfectly. "
An Englishman will ever be looking forward to defending the title for the first time, even though he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32 years of career.
'This is a very special feeling, 'said the player washing at Southport.
"I could not defend my Extremadura Open because it was taken off the competition calendar a year after my victory.
Magic is to come back in this part.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, and for me and my wife Sharon it was a special victory last year.
This was a very special time that we will forever carry in our hearts. "
At home, Gary Orr, who joined the family at the beginning of this year when he became 50, will return to the competition.
This is his first event in Scotland since the participation of the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Opel in 2013.
"The home to play is always a bit more meaningful," said Helensburg man Orr.
"You want to do well, but you also feel additional pressure.
I have enjoyed playing again enormously and I have shown quite a decent game of golf.
I am pleased with the way things are going so far. "
Ian Woosnam, former master of the Mastersi tournament in Trioga will join the champion Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNULTY.
Orr and the former Ryder karka Captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the race fire, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAalong, Bill Longmundor and Ross Drummond.
Access is free of charge, and parking a car with one passenger costs GBP 5 and GBP 10 to a car with two or more passengers.

Poverty and death in the gold-filled land of Indonesia
When the dinner is prepared by Barnina Degei, he does not use lead.
It uses even the pot rarely.
A housewife of wood in the capital of the Indonesian province of Papua will place a battalion in the local language a baton calling note 'directly at the fire place.
In half an hour, the charred mud will be taken from fire and the skin will be slammed with an unwashed hand.
Degei is sitting on the floor of the mud; he does not have a furniture, but he also does his daily housework, such as washing the water from the gender close.
The toilet is performed by a bucket in the room.
As the youngest of his wife's four women, he is not appointed to look after any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Late working, however, can be dangerous, most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are also soldiers here.
'No one dares to visit the village after five o'clock in the evening, 'he says.
It is a rare sight to see in Papua, the former Dutch colony, united under Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum which forced just 1026 old troops to vote under the occupation.
The movement for freedom from the domination of the Dutch people was quickly directed against the Jakarta Government, which continues to keep the region under its strong control by keeping foreign journalists and human rights supervisors out of control.
In 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, so that the autonomous Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island.
Enarotalia is a distant and abandoned place in the same way. To get here, it is necessary to fly 90 minutes from Jayapura, the capital of the province, to Nabire and then go through a five-hour journey with a rental car.
Public transport is not.
A city of about 19,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covering wavy iron roofs, which the rust have turned on different shades of yellow sprats.
Very few Indonesians have taken the journey here, not to mention journalists, nor have there been nearly any foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the man's pagan worshiped God by the name of Tamee.
There were other changes.
'We were not used to wearing these clothes, 'said Degei, referring to his hand-held, hand-held turban, the dark plus and the bright inside.
"Before that, we only carried plant leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and the statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are one of the worst in Asia.
But this is also the golden land of Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Panama, about a mountainous province of 153 000 inhabitants in New Jersey, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grassberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, based in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined approximately USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua will be proud of timber supplies, which are estimated to be worth USD 78 billion.
But these riches are the source of torment to the boats, as they result in the suffocating presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
According to a 2005 study by The New York Times, Freeport paid approximately USD 20 million to local soldiers and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to USD 150 000 to one of the officers.
The aspirations of the parties to ensure greater autonomy threaten to be met with gold and they are being ruthlessly dealt with.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killing of rebels belonging to the Papuan tribes was a measure of genocide in the 1970s.
Last year alone, over 3 900 peaceful protests were arrested by the Indonesian police in the region.
The 2016 report of the Archbishop of Birsbane, "We are all free" bears witness to the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial killings, torture (rape and electric strikes are particularly common), and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It is hard to count the number of victims, because such incidents occur every week," says the Indonesian investigator Andreas Harson, the organisation Human Rights Watch.
The screws are even tighter because Papua's natural resources have caused a new influx of people from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demography is changing, as Muslim economic migrants are arriving from the populous parts of Indonesia, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi islands.
The children's family canteens of Java and mixed vegetables sell Gato Gao-Gado, which is served with peanuts.
The locals cannot compete with them.
'Migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables more cheaply on the traditional market than their local tanks', explains Abeth You, aged 24, who moved to Jayapur, the capital of the province for work.
"The indigenous boat, Papua mama [women], they lose their market share as a result."
The Indonesian President, either Mr Widovo, known among the people as Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter won Papua's Presidential Palace on his way from 29 constituencies to 27, including Paniai.
But there has been very little change in Papua and the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in anticipation of it fulfilling our hopes of restoring justice," says you.
In fact, it was barely two months since Jokowi took office in October.
On 7 December 2014, 11 children in Enarotali were singing on a Christmas tree when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle in the darkness.
Aggrieved children told them they should switch off their performances.
According to the story of the local pastor Yavett Tebai, one of the soldiers was insulted to their tone and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, the drunken soldiers drove children and beaten them with their gun hands.
After that, one of the soldiers shot among the children.
One child, 16 years old Yuulianus Yeheimo, was beaten so brutally that he fell to a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby Electoral Commission was burnt down and the next day things escalated even more.
Around 1 000 young Papua men, women and children gathered for justice in front of the local police and military control centre in order to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting and submitted Papua's pagan dance, in the course of which Jehoist's circle and the song of the birds were buried.
Some protesters started to stone the police and the military.
As the indignation escalated, the soldiers were sent a command via the internal radio. "If the masses are resisting more than three times, let them down," according to an official document, which has been seen by the TIME, but has not been issued to local media publications.
The elder Yeeremias Kayame (56) of the city of Kemo Koto felt a threatening threat and called for peace to be maintained by asking the multitude to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"When I was turned around, I was suddenly shot to the left side," he said to the magazine TIME in his bright colours on the front of the wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who the shooter was, but it says that the moon had gathered from the ranks of the soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, there was plenty of revenge," he added.
The local man Alfius Youw received his shooting three times, according to a weak character.
'i ran to him and examined him through the body to make sure it was his, 'said the magazine TIME in black Yohannes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... kissed him."
In Papua, the chief police inspector Yotje Mende said to the reporters that they only returned the security of their division because it was attacked.
"We need to protect ourselves when we are threatened with death," said Commission Pudjo Sullistyo, the police press officer, in 2015.
"This is a matter of life and death."
According to human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
News of the killings reached Jakarta only the following day.
Three weeks later, Mr Jayapuras delivered a passionate speech in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and allowed him to deal with the abuses in Papua.
"I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would put in place an out-of-court mechanism to solve human rights crimes.
But there were also excuses almost immediately.
"Most crimes were committed long ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s.
It is about being committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes, "he said.
However, when talking to the TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June, Wiranto withdrew his words saying that he has no intention of setting up a mechanism in Papua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said 'everything shall be settled by law'.
Wiranto, accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in East Timor in the course of the bloody independence referendum in 1999, said that 11 human rights crimes have already been resolved in Papua, including the events in Panama.
The families of the victims of the Paniai accepted such claims with a bad feeling of mistrust.
'i have been interrogated four times over the last three years, but no progress has been made, 'said Yohannes.
"I'm tired."
He says that many years later he is still living in fear.
'i am afraid, 'he says.
'i am afraid that the army will arrest me, I am afraid I will be shot. '
He's brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the Paniai people are afraid of this incident being resolved.
He said that he had been beaten by the army after he had helped to kill the four victims.
'After burying the dead bodies, the army had to seek me, 'he says.
The shooting has not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot visitors to the neighbouring Paniai district of Deiyais.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, in a war between the villagers and the head of the construction company, who refused to transport an unconscious man to hospital.
This man, a 24-year-old Ralianus Douw, who sank a fish in a nearby river, died on the way to a hospital.
Angry village people protested at the building site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers created police officers with stones, after which the latter responded with warning bills.
But according to the local authorities, mobile Brigade (Indonesian-armed police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
'We were in great panic, we are afraid of revenge, 'said the TIME's 29-year-old Domingu Badi, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured on the front.
"I have hidden myself in my house for two days."
The Deiiyai parliament has called for the relevant police officers to be held accountable and for the police mobile Brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development nourishes the dissatisfaction of the men, many, many, many and many of the tribes of Papua's sorry middle-hill country.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL), army of rebels, which they say protects the rights of Pope by organising attacks and kidnapping among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL came from the Bank, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, the army, under the pretext of 'protecting national sovereignty', has in recent years arrested thousands of people in Panama and arbitrarily detained.
Some of them never appear again.
Banks are known among the people of Papua as a 'tragic forgotten place'.
Poverty fuels dissatisfaction.
The little rice that Enarotali sells is too expensive for local people to buy.
Bread is equally unattainable.
People grow all their food, mostly batates, plus a bit of fruit and vegetables from the leaves.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom is able to maintain four or five battalions.
They usually keep most of the harvests in their families; the rest are sold locally.
Ten batates cost only 10 000 Indonesian screws (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequalities between the traditional tanks and the new migrants that have come in large numbers since the opening of the new routes at Nabire airport have increased.
The few jobs that exist go to better-educated and more prosperous migrants.
The parties themselves often lack capital or the necessary skills to conduct a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in survival because there are no jobs and no money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Board of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
In addition, severe restrictions on foreign media remain.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escuded and Bastille Longchamp, were expelled from Papua because 'they did not follow the relevant practices', although they had been given a rare film permit.
According to Pheelim Kine, Deputy Head of the Asian Department for Human Rights Watch, the Jokowi election pledges to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"In Indonesia, journalists trying to report to Papua from the most troubled provinces in the East and the West Papua are threatened by new threats, visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in the statement.
The lack of press coverage means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states were encouraged to, Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands,'s; the UN Human Rights Council investigated' various large-scale crimes' in Papua, including the shooting at Panama.
These same countries have historically supported the VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, the Indonesian Foreign Minister, dismissed the accusations of this group by saying to journalists in Jakarta: 'Democratic order and freedom of the press are still in force in Indonesia, so that the evidence against human rights is hard to bury'.
Local people want more foreign governments to be taken into account.
When the Dutch official delegation led the country's human rights ambassador, Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapur on 4 May, local people interrupted the meeting but, according to a source who wanted to remain anonymous, demanded their silence: 'We want freedom'.
Indonesia will have new presidential elections in 2019, but the boats do not believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of a Paniai," says Hobai, Chairman of the tribal council.
He wants to make it clear to Jokowi that, apart from the fact that the people of Panama are constantly living under the threat of a savage army, they are suffering from misery because of poor educational and health services.
According to Gobai, the bank people, like other boats, must have their voice on Jokowi in debt, which they must pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the attacks on the Paniai were able to cope with the last symbolic counterattack, they buried one of the victims in the country opposite the police and military base.
Knowing that justice may never be done, they will at least prevent those responsible from forgetting their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with a fallen head.
"What else can we do?"
The cloud panel of Dubai Torch was swallowed up for the second time.
On Friday, one of the world's top residential buildings, Dubai, came through to eat, forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee this 337-metre height and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that has ravaged the high construction that has been going on for just two years, as it happens to be called the Torch, or the Ring Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct fire-related causes were presented.
"We slept and woke up to the fire alarm and people's cries.
We ran down stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down on the 50th floor, "said Reuters, a resident who called himself George.
According to Dubai's civil protection officers, fire fighters extinguished flames at about 4 a.m. local time (00: 00 GMT) and chilled the building.
The government said that they would work to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident could once again raise questions about the safety of high-speed foreign surface materials around the world.
An investigation by the Torch Bureau in the wake of the fire in 2015 found that the most damage was caused by faculties - decorative panels and insulation of the outer surface.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London Grenelle Tower and the fascist panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire that occurred there in June, in which approximately 80 people died.
See: These phones will probably become sales hits in the autumn
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for fans of technology, as then phone manufacturers will publish their new top models.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came on sale, also in the autumn we can expect a new hit-phone for our shelves.
According to Kristian Seema, Director of Tele2 Marketing and Sales, this year's ships are characterised by innovative design, instant screen, server-to-server 4K resolution display and ultra-fast process.
A great excitement was created in the technology world by Samsung Galaxy S8, which has reached the front of the sales ranking for Estonian smartphones.
The autumn will allow even faster fast recharging, more durable battery, a higher quality camera and a higher water and dust resistance for smart driers.
He added that, from rumours, it is already possible to speculate and predict the four top models that will probably flood the streets.
These four top models of smartphones will be available on the shelves again this autumn.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the shelves as early as mid-September.
There is a lot of rumour about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it.
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences to the iPhone 6s next door, then Apple's 10th birthday is expected to be marked by a new model that differs completely from previous ones.
Four colours have been mentioned: Black, white, pink and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably the display that covers the entire telephone pre-panel, the home button lost and the fingerprint reader is built on the screen.
Apple's design leader, JonyIve, demands that the new iPhone model look like a smooth glass.
There has also been talk of the ceramic version of iPhone.
In addition to the open-source connection, cable-free recharging and even better-quality camera can be expected to speed the A11 process.
This is certainly one of the most welcome smartphones for a year.
The brand-new model Galaxy Note 8 will start on August 23.
There are a lot of rumours leaked about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It is said to be designed even more for a commercial user and the S Pen allows even greater functionality.
There should be two cameras on the phone, one on the legal front and the other on the TV site with a narrower field of vision.
At the moment, no one knows what the two rear cameras can do, but in any case, this is the first trial of Samsung, which is certainly comparable to the iPhone 8 in terms of quality.
However, we are looking forward to 23 August.
Although Nokia has sold three smartphones, headed by Nokia 6, this year, there is still a lack of flagship ship, Nokia 8, which is already being presented on 16 August.
We expect from Nokia 5.3-duty-bound display and ultra-fast Qualcomm Snaprago 835 processor and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminium corps and a significant level of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras, the option of which is produced by Zeiss.
If Sony's firm flagship has been XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added shortly.
We are waiting for a smartphone, which is a bit more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
The Sony's new model has been speculated that its screen is at least six-fold.
What reality brings us is that we will see very soon, because traditionally Sony has unveiled his autumn flagship at the IFA, which will be held from 1 to 6 September this year.
According to transcripts leaked telephone calls, Trump Mexican was pressured to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post released the transfer of telephone calls between US President Donald and state leaders from Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, in a telephone call to Trump, the President of Mexico, Enrique pena Nietole, appealed to the effect that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The American President turned to him for publicly condemning the wall, saying: 'You must not tell the press'.
The drum made a commitment in his presidential campaign to build the wall along the southern border of the United States and to make Mexico pay for this project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Malcolm Turnbulla, the Australian Prime Minister, were also published, revealing intense debate.
The drum told Turnbull that the agreement by the United States to take in refugees to Australia would be 'ridiculous', 'faceless' and 'foolish', he claimed that the deal that was done under the Obama administration would leave his impression of being 'displaced' in the United States.
The trump ended his speech by telling Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not consider the OÜ MRP Linna lines's complaint in the case where the city of Tartu rejected their offer for the purchase of bus and coach transport from July 2019 until 2029.
This is an order letter rejecting the offer of the OÜ MRP Linna at the local bus service in Tartu because the offer did not meet the requirements explained Anneli Apuhin, President of Tartu's LinnaGovernment Legal Service.
This is for the period of public transport within the city of Tartu for the period from 01.07.2019 to 30.06.2029.
The lines of MRP Linna have referred the decision of the Tartu District Court to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court did not take this action.
Although many people complain in the social media that the noise coming from the Weekend Festival disturbs their nights and the whole city is full of drunkenness, there are also many who have not a single word to say about the festival running on the beach.
I am even positively surprised that the shops were so polite!
I did not see any blurring or rudeness.
Even out of kindness I saw, "says Laine.
"It's great to come, be, and enjoy Pärnu, which has remained in winter, as the feeling of winter is," he says gladly.
The strain on the beach, the Laine und, does not disturb.
While living in the city centre, he still heard that music was being played on the beach, now music has not yet reached his home walls.
'But I hope I hear, 'he says gladly.
Also, according to Agnes, who spoke with the pavilion, the festival is rather good for Pärnu - it contributes greatly to the turnover of local merchants.
In addition, he is pleased that there have been so many paintings in the summer capital.
The noise of the Peolis does not stir up the woman.
Although I am no longer sunbathing at the beach, it is nice that the beach is alive.
And it's great that a nation moves and it's been so three times already, "says the woman.
I think the first time was a bit worse.
'Then perhaps there were complaints, 'he ponders.
However, noise at the beach is a common occurrence for the summer chiefs.
"This Weekend is a very good promo to our small town," says the park's fine Harri.
Neither has the noise and the noise made it easy for her to handle life.
But misogyny?!
We should all make savings.
Think about how this interethnic communication would be better.
The men of loud music do not crush.
It does not stir, even though I live close to it.
"Good men can save and there is no harm," he says.
According to him, the guests coming to Pärnu are wise.
"With the bottles, of course, they are a little exaggerated, but young people are a god and a master of God - give go, but be human and we can do!" He says.
Coastal residents have travelled away by this time, whether to relatives or acquaintances.
"But overall, the festival will have a positive impact - people like such noise," says Pärnus with children who walked to Tiina.
Even his family's sleep does not disturb the festival, although it took place last year even further from the street.
Last summer the stage was different, then we heard more.
We live outside the city, that it is actually quite well received from the shores of the River Pärnu, "he says.
Pearson cuts another 3 000 jobs and reduces dividends to revitalise business
The British educational company Pearson said on Friday that another 3 000 jobs will be cut and that its interim dividends will be reduced by 72%, thus launching another restructuring programme to deal with the financial distress threatening the business.
The jobs to be taken out, as John Fallon says, are likely to be lost at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will be in addition to the 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced plans to cut costs by an additional GBP 300 million (USD 394 million) in the third cost reduction programme in order to try to revive businesses hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company that agreed to sell its shares to its partner company Penguin Random House, Bertelsmann, said that their expectations for the year have not changed since the 1% increase in sales of GBP 2.05 billion was announced in the first half of the year.

Coup d'état in Kabul: Suicide attack killed NATO soldier
According to officials, the former suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
In a NATO statement it was said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unsubstantiated local reports, three civilians also died in an incident at the Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the latest in a series of acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in a mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO's statement said that the explosion on Thursday night took place when the Afghan army of joint patrols attacked 'man-made explosive bodies'.
According to the statement, everyone is in a stable situation and is being treated in the US military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to correspondents, the Taliban and the group known as the 'Islamic State' (ISIS), the growing power in Qarabagh in NATO-Bagram, is a serious source of concern.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which approximately 20% were killed in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people, mainly within the Shiite division.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the city centre - the most deadly military attack in the country since the US-led forces deposed the Taliban in 2001.
This violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while the President of the United States, Donald Trump, is considering whether to increase the number of US troops and police troops in the country.
According to correspondents, suicide attacks in recent weeks in Kabul have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, in President Ashrah Ghani.
The EPA annulled the decision to postpone the Sudeten Man
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (United States Environmental Protection Agency,,EPA) annulled the decision to delay the Obama regulation forcing states to curb smog emissions, one day after 15 states took legal action against the Agency.
Late on Wednesday, the EPA announced the decision to proceed with the 2015 ozone-setting process, saying that it demonstrated the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our partners in our partner countries and to listen to them," said the EPA's leader, Scott Pruut, in a statement.
Pruut had announced in June the EPA's intention to postpone its ozone-content determination,, which measured smog in different parts of the country to determine where it should be reduced to a higher air quality standard by 1 October 2018.
The 15 mainly democratic states brought an action together with Columbia on a Tuesday saying that the decision was illegal.
President Donald's truer government has tried to withdraw many of the environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama; it is, more to the point, part of a more comprehensive plan to boost growth.
However, these attempts have provoked reactions among democrats and natural protection groups concerned about the effects of increased pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhalation of ozone-containing air "may reduce the working capacity of the lungs and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases, such as asthma.
There may be a party on German pigs.
Pigs and cattle in Germany can hold a party, as strong rain threatens the yield of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, writes Bloomberg.
This year, it may be the case that weeks of sawing before the harvest can mean that fruit intended for the bread industry can only be used for animal feed.
"The quality of wheat is far worse than last year's and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, the analyst of Agree Raiffeis.
This year can go up to 40 percent of German wheat for animal feed, which is twice as normal, predicted in Agria.
This year, German farmers, like their European colleagues, have come into contact with all kinds of weather.
First, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June replaced the heat wave.
In July, Germany was hit by sawmills that have continued in August.
Many eyes are turned to northern Germany, where the rain prevents harvest.
So far only five per cent of wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area has not yet seen the harvest even under way, as announced by the local buying-up company CeHealth.
"These are quite difficult days," said Frank Deccket of Rendsburg, the senior trader of CeHealth.
Consistency in all, i.e. the design of Finnish interior designs
The beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the fairs, because through the great windows the unparalleled views of the shores of Saimaa are reaching many rooms (life).
Every step is marked by the aspirations of our northern neighbours to create both harsh and perfect (energy-saving) homes at the same time.
It is worth a great deal of admiration and respect for the ability of Finns to use wood as a material for construction and finishing, furniture and beauty.
Stimulating techniques and smart solutions can be found in the trade fairs by both the builder and the (home) designer.
There you will need to be very clear that black, white and grey shadings, if they are supplemented by wooden tones and room plants, can be very pleasant.
The fair will last until 13 August.
There are many tips and herbs in this kitchen.
During the night of today, a line was drawn down to this year, the Weekend Festival Baltica, and Martin Garrix took everything in his power to remember the last speaker.
The people were in a real turn during the performance of Garrix - singing, crawling, dancing.
When Garrix finished, the common mass was rolled out from the beach of Pärnu to the city.
We bring to you a gallery, with all the pictures that our photographer was trying to get in Weekendil for three days.
Surely you are also some of them, looking for yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are supposed to be on a collision course to face the most attractive poker match in the near future up to 66.7 kg weight class, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were at the ESPN office in Los Angeles, separate rooms until Garcia, an unbeatable World boxing Council lighthouse, walked at the other end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World boxing Organisation Weightliftion.
Following the victory won by Garcia on Saturday over the former four-fold World champion Adrien Bronner, the result of a unanimous decision by Garcia, both fighters are at the forefront of the weighting list.
Garcia gave her a better hand and said, "How do you go, a champion?
I wish you success. "
Lomachnko protects his belts with Miguel Marriaga against Saturday night at k19 ESPN.
When a couple of photos for the pox, the Lomachenko pine, in Egis Klima, stated that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be "perfect moderation."
"I'm a former feather," said Garcia.
"I moved up for Broner [to 63.5 kg], but I am not so big.
I am 63.5 kg per small.
I want to move below the weight.
And he must move upwards of the weight of [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
Fans have asked for this.
Let us offer it to them. "
Lomachinko agreed.
"The postal world needs this fight."
Mr Klima raised the question of whether it should be paid to look at it, as part of his strategy to let Lomachenkol battle with 61.2 kg of class later this year to meet Garcia (37-0), who have an interest in Fortlo 23 September.
"It could be a good idea to watch this battle, as the fans have wanted this confrontation," said Garcia later saying that it is open to fighting on any channel offering the best financial package.
"We are the main players.
No other name can attract so much attention.
Whenever they are ready... '
Garcia said that he regarded Lomachenko as a "powerful fighter" and could go to see his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia by saying that he thought that the master of the three divisions from Riverside had looked 'very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted it short'.
According to Garcia, the aim was to show strength and then to pose.
Both confirmed that they felt the pressure for prosperity between them was increasing.
"This is a fight that is awaiting realisation.
No other confrontation causes so much attention and fog.
I am more than willing to work on this, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It will be a good fight. "
Which of the world's pressures are being moved to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Agency (PPA) renewed and issued a record 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, when it was decided last year to issue a fixed-term residence permit for 6702 foreigners, the figure was 4928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared by the Ministry of the Interior.
Ten years ago, almost 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year, and in recent years, the number is approaching 2 000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis, with 1087 in 2014 receiving a fixed-term residence permit, up from 675 a year earlier.
According to the statistics agency, the number of citizens of Ukraine is growing most in Estonia - more than 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived last year in Estonia.
"The Ukrainian community has been large in Estonia all the time, and due to the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought in a country where the community and many families are already ahead," said the Ministry's press officer, Kristin Rammus.
Last year, the number of Ukrainians with a fixed-term residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in 10 years the most fixed-term residence permits have been issued to the latter.
If the Ukrainians come here predominantly to work, then Russian citizens will be due to family migration.
"Given the historical Russian community here, they are more likely to have the most important family ties with the people living in Russia," said the Finnish migration scientist at the Inner Academy of Inner Maaning.
"When you look at where Russian citizens who have received Estonian residence permits have moved to, after Harjumaa, there is also East Virumaa," he added, and pointed out that about 40 per cent of them have married to a European Union citizen.
Last year, Russian citizens obtained a fixed-term residence permit of 1696, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permit decreased.
"The leap is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for permanent residence in Estonia," explained Rammus, the Ministry of the Interior's press officer, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia from the previous year.
The aim is to encourage the survival of those who have adapted.
However, a long-term resident's residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably also declined because of the new residence permit.
Last year, for example, 146 Ukrainians obtained a residence permit, which has been working here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians can change jobs, and the Estonian state is no longer pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit became popular at the blow - applicants were still holders of grey passports (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A residence permit of 1968 was issued for residence in Estonia, among them 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number Chinese.
The total number of such applicants has already been 1269 in the first half of this year.
In ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence.
When three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, 200 last year.
Nigeria will become a part of the university here.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among, for example, Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of Indian, Bangladeshi and Nigerian citizens has increased mostly because of school migration.
For these, too, the rule is that where a community has been created, it is easier for others to follow, "added Rammus.
In ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from North Korea, just as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If approximately 6 000 third-country nationals obtain a residence permit per year, this represents approximately 0.46% of the total population.
Even if we add the citizens of the European Union, migration will remain around a percentage, "says Maastricht, in fact, that the numbers are small.
According to the Statistical Office, 14 822 people moved to Estonia last year, but 13 792 left Estonia.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration.
Most of the people who have moved and moved are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among those who have left.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was in deficit with 2 000 people last year.
The Estonians move mainly between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess fascinates with satians, steps and pieces
The bottomless pit of ideas for Maria Tammeoru, however, has a history - old paintings and moisturizers: "I can dream for hours in a museum and admire the ancient thieves and craters.
If you do something with passion then you study and learn about it every day.
That is the joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem strange to some, but the designer does not think so.
You will decide how much brilliance there is in your life!
I have a girlfriend, who has a whole sauna full of graves that I have created from the Couture dress.
For neither is it his fault that he does not live in Hollywood and does not go to the red carpet every day, he wants to wear the most beautiful dress and carry it!
You can live your own life special!
The fashion designer does not recognise the gap between shining events and grey day.
It was this reasoning that set in motion the plan to take the height of Estonian land, between forests and fields, to people who often cannot be reached by fashion.
The collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu moeallee, where the 45 modular royal deflation filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, the shop is often taken in, nodded with dignity, but there is more emotion in other places - call the Bravo, stand up, want to thank you for the handiwork.
A large part of the audience had to reform themselves, but now they are fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed the expectations of the people, they will be excited!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer show with my fashion.
We had a red carpet of 50 metres in Pärnu, and the whole street was full of beautiful dresses, it seemed they had no end!
Maria also does not recognise the fashion that the creation must be presented by a super-model, she brings willingly to the stage of ordinary women.
Often I call the stage for my own customers - they have always gladly come.
After all, it is such a layer of experience that you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I am so sorry that I have never seen my own performance, I am always behind the stage to give the hopeless perfectionist the last finishing touches.
My nerve would not allow me to sit idly by.
Maria is this kind of fashion designer, who wants not only to play a representative role, but to be in everything.
I have my own pleasure in the studio, most of the collection I do myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, discover.
I am never far from my creation and I am not afraid of the work.
Design does not stop at all, including the stylist, logistics, organisation, organisation - everything has to fit in the day of one temperament woman.
To make these hours come fanatics will still be huge.
I cannot say when my working day will end, for me it is just a day of joy!
I'm still very lucky - it's like a constant happiness: I'm doing something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and yet, in turn, compliments.
It has been said many times that my dress has magic - they make you feel like a princess.
The rich quarrel between the satians, which Maria Talent made famous overnight, has remained the signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin Müürsepp of the U18 boys: The weapon of the lower group tournament of Estonians was now turned against us
Sorry, the fairy tale has run out.
First of all, we missed our table.
And if there's such a big difference in the table, there's nothing to be done, "commented Martin Müürsepp, the Estonian U18 basketball team, who played our only basketball player in the NBA, BC Kalev / Cramo assistant coach.
The opponents took 28 balls out of the offensive and received so many more attacks as a result.
We were not prepared for their aggressive defence or attack, it created.
Many of the attacks by the Englishmen ended in three to five seconds, we could not build protection.
In the defence, however, they could hold a hand everywhere; we could not combine.
This created the crew with feet from bottom.
The homework of the opponents was better.
Müürsepa estimated that Estonia should have made more tactical errors to take the resistance off the ground.
In the last quarter - we had zero error, but the opponents have already received several quick ears.
Athleticism and heavy insistence, which was a subgroup tournament for our weapon, now all turned against us.
Today we had no strength against their aggressiveness.
Müürsepp was satisfied with his ministry in Kalevi, Matthias Tassi.
On the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team; until now, there was a single set of hit-ups.
It is a pity that so aggressive an opponent had already been burned before the courts.
Tass was always confident and played his way even today, but it seemed that he was tired - he had borne quite a heavy burden.
But he made some quite beautiful moves that I've seen before in training, "added the tutor.
Terrible numbers: In the young basketball team, three quarters less than 10 points...
In the U18 age group, not only young men's emis B division are visiting Tallinn, they started the day before yesterday in Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland, unfortunately, was in the field of antirecords.
Estonia lost 25: 65, but after the third column the position was 9: 49, or just in the last ten minutes the opponents took their foot from the gas pedal, and the period ended with 16: 16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia was thrown at 4, the third at 1 point...
At the same time, the Estonians hit two pieces from the first four minutes, and then two pieces from the first four to 25 pieces from the game, one in three and then another 21 whiskies along...
Perhaps in almost half an hour a 47 whiskey was hit.
In addition, paragraph 2 came from four free whiskies.
The number of bursaries was reasonable at that time, 12.
Finally, the Polish whiskey was 33% and Estonia 13% (68 / 9).
Estonia started with two losses, and on the opening day it had to admit 83: 56 pairs in Portugal.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to complement the stocks
Today, NATO's 1st permanent mine control team arrived at Tallinn for a planned port visit to improve ship stocks and prepare for future exercises.
During the visit the ships prepare for their return to the sea, giving crew the opportunity to take a few days off.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out numerous exercises and be ready for future operations in search of historical explosive devices.
"The participation of Estonians in NATO and their cooperative activities in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with allied forces," said the Chief of Operations and Planning Section of the Navy's Chief, Captain Arto Reinmaa.
Since 29 June, Latvian naval soldier Gvida Gvido Laudups, a permanent anti-personnel NATO team leader, has taken over the tasks of group leader in Riga from the Estonian Navy officer, Captain Johan-Elias Seljamatt.
The flag ship of the group is the Latvian Navy's supporting vessel LVNS Virsait, which also operates a group flagship.
During this semester, the Estonian naval minehunter Sakala is also part of the international unit.
As one of the four groups of vessels under the command of NATO's maritime military personnel, NATO's 1st permanent mine control group is a ready-made unit in the first rapid reaction force, which the alliance can send to different parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, launched 13 years ago by Maestro Ericlass, is being held.
This year, the Birgitta Festival is to be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to Risto Joost, the artistic leader of Tallinn Philharmonic.
Risto Joost: The listeners will receive the "Traviata" and "Tuscany," ballet shows from the fascinating "Boleron" fun "Karlsson, and there is no plan for the self-production that this time has been created by the Havrith's" For 2015. "
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatrical discoveries.
It is bigger than any music theatre in its usual form.
It is a festival that will take hold and will never be fully opened again.
For the experience which the listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes the human souls ring and touches the human perception in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the first year of Birgitta Festival as an artistic leader.
Did Maestro's special classes's shoes not look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaas, it has helped a lot.
He directed me through my whole student career and also supported dirigisme at the beginning.
Perhaps this will make it easier for me to continue with his work.
The different class has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival and, of course, all this is transferred to me.
It was wonderful to join a team who knows how things are going.
It was the great heart of the special classes that gave me the strength to make good progress with the Birgitta festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am and I can do it!
What could the audience this year at the festival attract, what are you offering?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, surprisingly, the first ballet written in Astrid Lindgren's story will be presented.
This is "Karlsson flies."
And one of the infamous nuances of this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write this work.
He obviously has a Karlsson character who has lived in his soul since he was a child.
Cross, how can you bear all this?
Thanks certainly to my supporting partner.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and that is what I am fortunate enough to have.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend so much on other people as I myself, in other words how I go against every new day.
And such conscious holding of tone, holding positive and actually smiling themselves into the mirror of the morning, raised my happiness percentage considerably.
Especially now this week, when the most important tests are, I have been particularly eager to practice it and it works.
Smiling itself will activate the brain and lift the tone.
That is not just a proverb.
I think that people do not yet know about half of the things that the universe offers them, but everyone will discover it gradually.
Immediately, it is an important moment.
Do you also have a ritual before entering the dirigiste powder?
There are still clothes to be exchanged for more comfortable ones.
It is a small moment for itself.
But in general, yes, I have no chance of rest or a small sleep before the big performance.
In fact, I even like to communicate actively with people, even before I'm entering the dirigindpowder.
But come to Birgitta's festival, here is what to discover, not too much of a opera and ballet friend!
Watch an attractive video from Risto Joost!
New results of the Swedish age assessment tests published
The most recent results of the test show that more than 80 per cent of those tested were older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Literacy (Rätsmedicine) started the tests at the beginning of this year.
The tests were set up to assess the age more accurately during the asylum application process after the Swedish Immigration Service (Migrator) was criticised for failing to correctly identify the age of several alleged minor refugees.
To date, the Migrator has sent a total of 6880 cases to be tested and the Institute of Legal Medicine has issued a total of 2481 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were considered to be 18 years old or older and, in a further 25 cases, the Institute of Legal Medicine estimated that the testing 'may be 18 years old or older'.
In 432 cases it was concluded that a person is "probably younger than 18."
Tests are only used when a person's age is under question.
According to Johan Göransson, who is working at the Institute of Judgment, the results are consistent compared to those of the previous months.
"We do not see a great difference between the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are quite consistent," he said in the newspaper The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were considered to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued 581 tests in May and said that 442 cases "indicate that the person being studied is 18 years old or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet looked at the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that 243 cases had been directly claimed by the person that he would receive 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, whereby X-ray images of software and knees in the MRT are made available for analysis by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some quarters.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose job includes assessing people's biological maturity to find out whether they passed the puberty sooner or later.
"I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the method of measurement currently used should be used.
The definition of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say with certainty, then we should not make the face that we can, "he said to the newspaper Metro.
But Johan Göransson from the institute of forensic medicine protected the accuracy of the tests: "It can be generally said that the risk of the child becoming an inaccurate adult is small.
The greatest risk, at about 10%, is when the person is a bit under 18. "

Anna Maria Orel, a 20-year-old vascular, made the London World Cup a beautiful debut with 67.37ga room for the 18th place.
The organ was the youngest female hammer of the World Cup, and a cheerful woman confirmed that she hoped to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I had a good experience.
In the first test (64.80) I immediately gave my average result, in the second (62.80) I risked too much and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep it clear, "said Orel after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions and I am very happy to have found it.
Anna Maria Oreli World Cup ended in 18th place.
It did not mix the rain in Orlel, because after all, he will train the winter through the TÜ stadium.
"I'm hardened," he said with a little fairy tale.
At the London Olympic Stadium there was almost a full house of people, whether Orel perceived the people around him or was able to turn himself off?
I felt, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it gives more - that is the case!
If you compete, you can experience it.
The organ confirmed that it is satisfied with the World Cup and that there are still many good competitions ahead of it: "I came here for the 32nd or last result during this year's season, I finished in 18th place.
This is a very good result.
I'm 20 years old and the World Cup - that's the only thing that counts.
I take a good experience and on some days I want to compete for medals.
The Governor of West Virginia reported the exchange of political parties
West Virginia's Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening at his gathering with President Trump that he would change political parties.
"Like it or not, the democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I say to you, having prayed and pondered hard... today I tell you, to the Western Estonians, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
When it was gathered, the joys were joyful.
"So I will become a republic tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a trustee, I would say to you that it is time to play another game."
Trump had promised a major announcement in the past of West Virginia's gathering.
The Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support the Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and the coal business inherited from his father.
Its value is approximately USD 1.59 billion.
At the same time, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee (RNC) published an announcement that 'the party-change of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would rather prevent the country from being improved rather than working for it'.
"With only 15 governors and control over the lowest number of states in history, Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent pronouncement on a party that is out of control and is unable to find a positive and unifying message," said McDonnell McBS News.
It is no surprise that where there are many people, there are also many injured.
Urmet, who is in office in the Weekendil medical axis, told the Academy page yesterday that they had to distribute the patches quite a lot.
The wild and berry trees are basic, out of the wrinkles and light fall.
Of course, it also has head, back and foot pain.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with false shoes and so the problems come.
The medics have also had to help a couple of the biggest injured visitors - there have been some panic attacks and also one infallible lawn.
We have also made joys when a person has broken a hand or a finger.
We will make the best of our efforts here, we will send the better to the hospital.
Watch the video to see if the celebrations will also ask for painkillers to treat the pohmelli.
Coe praised the Russians for their honest apology for the doping scandal
As he said, 'Russia's honest excuse for Thursday' was being praised by the international nose of the Kergeothers, Sebastian Coe, but reiterated that this is not the time to allow the country to recover its sport.
At the IAAF Congress held on the eve of the Kergean World Cup, the ban on competition imposed on his country is correct and he has a strong aim to combat doping.
He apologised for 'all the athletics from whom gold and silver medals are missing in the competitions'.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban on competition introduced in November 2015 following the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report on state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest answer, a very honest presentation," said the IAAF President, Mr Coe, to the journalists.
"The Council as a whole and the Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself acknowledged that they have had rather difficult times and that they are doing everything possible to restructure the State Union."
He also welcomed Russia's acceptance of the criteria for his restoration.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but the Congress supports the working group's proposal that this is not the time to withdraw Russia," said Mr Coe.
"We must do all we can in the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from broken systems, "he added.
19 Russian athletes meeting the rigorous criteria of the IAAF will compete as neutral athletes at the World Championships in Lightweight in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, the chairman of the IAAF working group, said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet a number of recovery criteria.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that the doping check was still insufficient and that the banned coaches were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution will make a significant difference to the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
Little by the fact that the electric car revolution will significantly change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mining giants like Glencore can say that they will win from one place and lose from the other, it will not help smaller mining companies.
At present Glencore serves coal and oil, but in the age of electric cars, cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel demand will increase.
This year, contributions to the distribution of electric cars have been increased by the decisions of the governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway, which promise to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
As a result, Volvo has already known that it plans to abandon its internal combustion engine, and Tesla will bring to the market a cheaper model 3 electric cars.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that electric cars will be sold for more than oil-based cars over two decades.
"For some metals, it makes a difference," said Simona Gambranin Bloomberg, the Capital Economics analyst.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has been increasing for years.
Electric cars are about three times more copper than ordinary cars, reported by Glencore.
More copper is needed at recharging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that this will increase demand for copper by about 5% by 2025.
Increasing demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore receives a rising price rise driven by the growing trend of electric cars and the fact that it is the world's largest producer of cobalt, according to the Jeffersons Group.
This global firm estimates that other winners of the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already reacting to a changing trend.
This year, 70 per cent of the London Metal Exchange has increased by cobalt.
The price increase for last year was 37 per cent.
Copper, too, has increased by 14% this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's share increased by 20% in London, having exceeded the price rise by Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the losing side are lead companies like Recyclex and Campine, which have to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of lead is the supply of start-ups for cars with petrol and diesel engines.
Lithium-ion batteries are used by electric cars.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless another purpose is found to overcome the fall in demand," said Michael Widmer, CEO of the Metal Markets at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The effect of the transparent trend in lead price movements has not yet been noticed.
Lead has increased by 17% this year, the best metal in London among the main industrial metals.
Investors will only see problems with metal in the long term.
"I'm not sure that lead is so bad because cheap oil will keep ordinary cars in competition," said the sales manager of Triland Metals, Herwig Schmidt.
When lead demand falls, it is slow.
It may be that this happens in about ten years.
In the meantime, higher exhaust standards mean that demand for hybrid cars, which depend on lead-based batteries developed by frequent engine start-ups, is on the increase, will be assessed by an international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel, as lighter vehicles can drive with less electricity further.
This explains the additional minimum requirement of 1.6 million tonnes until 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 per cent of the world's total production of aluminium.
Probably this trend will get worse, "said Widmer.
Aluminium has increased by 13 per cent this year, as growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a deficit in the market.
Steel manufacturers do not sleep.
Mr Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce wonderful car clubs.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop lighter alloys of steel to resist the lower minimum.
"Very strong steel should be the answer to this development," said Sylvain Brunet, analyst of Exane BNP Paribas.
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil age could also bring suffering to the platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious diesel engine was used as catalysts for cars, reported by the metal refining company Johnson Mathey.
"Many of today's high demand raw materials, such as oil and platinum, may not be in high demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, the Natix raw material analyst.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will change in 15 years.
Market producers believe in the continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, head of Uncore, said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in full-electric cars.
The great hope of the plant manufacturers in the 10-year term is for the Toyota motor and Hyundai Motos developed hydrogen cell-based cars that depend on the plate to produce hydrogen-based electricity.
So far, however, this technology has not yet made a business case.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the way to electric cars," said Exane BNP from Paris to Brunet.
In July, German car manufacturers were hit hard by the Stuttgart Court, which banned the use of diesel in the home town of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How monetary rules for football affect Neyman's transition to Paris
Rules designed to prevent the uncontrolled spending of European football clubs will not prevent the world-record transfer of Neyman from the Spanish football club to the French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences for UEFA, the governing body that rules the European game and that can prohibit teams from taking part in the prestigious Master League tournament, await Saint-Gerth in Paris.
UEFA's Financial Rules of Fair Play of 2011 mean that PSG will have to demonstrate at some point that the transfer of Neyman was financed without huge losses.
Barcelonale was paid EUR 222 million (EUR 262 million) solely for the purchase of Brazil from his contract, and Neyman's salary starts at tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of the transfer to the French club of Neyman.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to put such money in order to recruit Neyman and add its letters, given that the team is financed by the family governing the Catalan energy infringement.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to recruit players, but they must balance this with legal sources of income that allow them to come out of their own in the football club.
The FFP laid the foundations for Michel Platini following his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that the clubs falling into big debts in search of success would actually cheat and risk ruin if banks or owners were to give up their support.
From 2011, FSP clubs will focus on monitoring their losses rather than on their debts.
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich, first in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and then to spend large amounts to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
In the current three-year FSP evaluation period, which runs until 2018, clubs can incur losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Plato was shamefully dismissed from his presidential office in 2015, Alexander Cefer, the successor to UEFA, is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules," said the Associated press Andrea Traverso, a UEFA-FSP supervisor last week.
Although PSG paid for the purchase order of Neyman as a single payment, they can distribute this amount for accounting purposes throughout the period of validity of the contract.
Neyman entered into a five-year contract and can thus indicate the transitional fee at EUR 44.4 million per year over the next five years.
In the first wave of FSP sanctions in 2014, PSG, together with Manchester City of Abu Dhabi, received the most severe penalties in the neck.
PSG was fined €60 million (currently $82 million), reduced to €20 million later, and was required by the club to limit its team to 21 players in the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to embed financial institutions over-regulate, blowing up their revenues through companies linked to club owners.
The Katari company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to be above the standard market rate, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of Qatar Tourism Authority PSG support was overridden.
It has been said that some of the services of Neyman PSG may come from Qatar through payments from the Managing Committee of the 2022 World Cup.
However, PSG and Katar 2022 deny that Neyman could become an ambassador for the World Cup, and claim that UEFA's regulators could easily reveal such a manoeuvre.
The penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in any attempt to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, people familiar with the situation said that UEFA had not pro-actively discussed the transition with PSG in Neyman.
They spoke to the Associated press on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed as they are not allowed to discuss PSG's situation.
Recent reports show that PSG made profits of more than €10 million during the 2015-2016 season at a turnover of around €542.4 million.
The latest financial data has not yet been published.
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neyman will have a positive impact on sponsorship transactions, commercialisation and distribution.
The club expects an increase of at least 30 per cent in its turnover in connection with the signing of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly irritated by the departure of one of the largest footballers, tried to prevent Neyman's transition by claiming that the PSG was violating the FSP.
'This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with a club and a country, 'said Javier Tebas, President of La Liga, to the Spanish newspaper AS, pointing out that the PSG belongs primarily to Qatar.
The arsenals game manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports dress, shares the view of La Liga that the state finances the club.
"This is a consequence of property rights and it has completely changed the whole football landscape in the last 15 years," says Wenger on Thursday.
"When a club belongs to a state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play because a country can have other ways or other interests to represent a country as such a big player. "

Today, 50 years ago: The storm of the hurricane in Estonia that tore roofs and windows from the houses.
The storm of the century was mentioned, which shook the Baltic Sea, Harjumales and Raplamaa on August 6 and 7.
In north-west Estonia, the wind speeds of these days were more than 30 m / s.
My old man ran from one tree to another in the garden and tried to support them with hands.
Everything was dark and striking, like the end of the world.
In 2002, Mrs Linda Kurova reminded the magazine of Haapsalu in Estonia in an interview on Estonian Nature.
Linda's wife saw the gardens she planted collapse.
But what do you still support the trees with your hands, where will you withstand such a storm?
The sea came down the window, the windows sprayed water, 'said Mrs Linda, who lived on the street of Kalda in Haapsalu.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station's perrose had been flown 20-30 metres far, the Linda saw most of the ghost children just the morning.
According to the locals the trees were lying on the ground, some in a very long way, some in a half.
Everyone looked very depressing, the storm went through the beautiful old trees as a rag and as a training as a war.
The August 1967 storms were not particularly hard hit by Lääne-Viru County, but the losses were also severe, wrote the Official Journal of Virumaa in 2007.
The Southwest Park of Haapsalu and the Park of Padise were swept from the city centre, but our carrier parks were also badly affected.
In Tallinn, wind speeds of up to 35 metres per second were measured, or about 130 kilometres per hour.
On the evening of 6 August, in Tallinn, the Maritime Day had been shouted from one of the little stoves: 'Mother, Mother!
The chickens are in the air and can no longer be signed, "wrote the Official Journal of Virumaa.
The building of the manor house in Viljandi was destroyed during the storm to such an extent that it was later decided to be demolished.
The Augustine torm was not met by the structure of the ski jump in Türi, which was not restored later.
On 12 August 1967, the Red Star newspaper wrote that clearing towns and settlements of fallen trees and their branches are progressing slowly, and that the inhabitants could participate in the work of clearing.
Cereal crops were also severely damaged in the storm, and the newspaper reported that "the party organisations must be the driving force and direction in both cleaning and harvest."
If the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m per second.
The record of the wind in Puhangul in Estonia persists from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul was measured by the wind speed of 48 m / s.
The measuring speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean bathing areas: Night cleaning and poor coastal weather
Colder summer weather also means less cleaning in Tallinn bathing areas.
"If there is no weather, people are on the beach, and if there are no, there are no people," says the beach decoration.
There are kayaks on the shores of Stroummi in northern Tallinn.
For them, the melody competition is offered by a ground tractor on the low turns, which sweeps down the strips.
In fact, the last seven centimetres pass through the sand by removing marine litter and fallen down on people: Bottles, cigarettes, etc.
People are still coming to the beach, regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If there is beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if there are no, there are no people, "says Alexander Usov, the Head of the Private Company's cleaning works at Haaberst Haldus.
It is 6.30 a.m. and a bitter harvest is taking place on the beach because at 8 p.m. the platform must be in order for people.
Usov is already on the order of business at 4 p.m.
In addition to Stroum, he is still keeping an eye on the shores of Pirita, Harku, Kakuma and Paljakarai Pikaari.
There has been a reduction in the amount of rubbish.
Many years ago it was many more.
People can now appreciate what is being done for them, "says Usov, who has been decorating the beach for 15 years.
It used to be the case that when something new was put up, it was broken the next day.
Now, what is on the beach is being kept.
Price of a clean beach
One of the biggest works on Estonian beaches is the clearing of marine litter.
For example, it must be transported 400 000 tonnes at the Pirita beach.
"This is an incredible amount," says Usov.
The second large category is' municipal waste ', that is, everything that people abandon.
Eight large containers of waste have to be emptied three times a week on the six-kilometre Stroum beach.
That is how much waste is produced.
However, colder summers have meant that the amount of rubbish is one fifth less than it would otherwise be.
Third, abandoned items.
These are mostly grandchildren.
This time, several dozen model cars have been cobbled out of the sand by Usov.
They will be waiting for the owners to take the wooden path to the beach.
"Usually there will be more of them out, but that is the normal harvest." Usov already knows that soon he will find them again in the sand.
Children come to the beach and take the toys to sink them again into the sand.
Rubbish is scattered
Erika Schoolner, the representative of the Management Services in Haabert, admits that checks on the tractor are a nuisance for the local people.
The noise, which lasts from hours to early morning, interferes with the feelings of the people living in the neighbourhood.
On the day, however, this work is impossible.
The beach must be screened twice in one month.
"If we don't do this, then the city fines us," says Scholar.
However, the aim is, like Pirita, Pikat and Pärnu, to get the Stromi beach under the international blue flag quality mark.
"Compared to Europe, Estonia has a lot more work to do to maintain its beaches," said Scholar.
We have more adrru and more stones and more difficult to ride the sand.
However, there is less waste on our beaches than in the rest of Europe.
When they hear that there is a waste on the beach, Martin, living near the shores of Stroum, is forced into a conversation round between journalists and cleaning staff, highlighting the current bottlenecks on the beach.
The breakfast is a picture of the balcony everywhere.
The problem is birds and bottlers who have been blacklisted in landfills, "Martin states.
While it is hard to expect people to change their behaviour so far, Martin hopes that the city administration will do something about the rubbish bin, for example, and put them on the front so as to prevent birds, at least, from reforming there.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of the Stroum beach.
We can see that the city takes care of this.
It has become more pleasant with the lights, the illuminated and the freshly asphalt roads.
It used to be the case that the skates could only drive one way, "Mr Martin notes.
Aarnio's findings in Stromis: Coins, only coins
We have had to take advantage of the 40-year-old Dimitri, which holds the coastline with the metal detector as a treasure-piece.
He does not believe that today or in the future he will find anything valuable.
Sea gods are not generous enough.
"I've been working on it for a year and so far have found no value," says Dmitry.
In Dmitry's treasury, some euro coins, bottles and also dangerous pounds are being thrown into the bin.
Usually there are still coins.
"Gold, curtains and other such things are usually not there," says the treasure testimony.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%.
The Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates will remain at the same level, as weak economic growth and the relaxation of inflation have softened speculation in connection with the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain subdued as household incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The Bank Monetary Committee (MPC) policy makers voted to keep 2 rates at 0.25% and fewer members are calling for an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its growth forecast to 1.7% in 2017 and to 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household incomes would persist as inflation is expected to rise to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank also indicated that the growth in rates over the next few years will be necessary to contain the inflation driven by Brexit and that a higher rise in credit costs may be necessary on the financial markets than expected.
Members also voted a year ago in favour of a partial withdrawal of the mammoth package to revive the economy launched in Brexit.
The Bank will end the fixed-term facility providing cheap finance for banks in February, although it said that it is now expected to offer an increase of GBP 15 billion under this scheme, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says: 'In the medium term, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain unviable in the near future as the difficult situation of real household incomes continues to have an impact on consumption'.
On the subject of rates, it was reiterated that 'some tightening of monetary policy' is needed to mitigate inflation, and this to 'somewhat above' the level expected by the markets.
The stock market is now forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and the second one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all jumps were gradual and limited.
The bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and for next year are comparable to those of 1.9% and 1.7% respectively.
The 1.8% growth forecast for 2018 remained unchanged.
After that, the pound has fallen in relation to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures which have dampened growing expectations of the rise,GDP in the second quarter of last three months rose by 0.2% to 0.3%.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will pick up slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little cause for rejoicing at rising inflation and the pitiful rise in wages to households, saying that the situation would get a little worse before it improved.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent income shocks in the next few years, but towards the end of the three-year forecast wage recovery is expected.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also stimulated by a growing demand for British produce, which partly compensates for lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after the figures were moved by 0.25% last August, after the shocking EU referendum, which caused the pound sudden weakening.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully breathe life into prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's last decision, growing demand for a rise in the rate was felt, as inflation had increased the pressure on households, and in July three policy makers demanded an increase in the rate to 0.5%.
Inflation fell last month to 2.6%, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected and there will be a further rise in the coming months.
The bank said that the excessive increase compared to the 2% target was entirely due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montake, CEO of Coreco mortgage brokers, said: "In view of the recent drop in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming ever more competitive once again, as lenders yearn to work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock exchange seems to be particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end, as refinancing, often without service charge and at a low rate, has become increasingly popular. "
NHS is writing 10,000 anti-HIV drugs
Patients have, since September, access to 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment following a battle fought by the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England reported that public health care is now making available to an estimated 10,000 people pre-exposure prophylactics (Prep) - a tablet administered before the beginning and showing a reduction in the risk of infection for high-risk people by approximately 86%.
The NHS agreed to fund a clinical trial after the Appeal Court upheld last year's Supreme Court ruling that the NHS could pay for the Prep, despite the agency's own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, Chief Executive of NHS England, welcomed this announcement on Thursday as' a new massive intervention 'while the National AIDS Foundation (NAT) described it as' a turning point '.
In October, there will be more clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield, before the programme is established everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylactics (Prep) are the months of HIV drugs that are taken before the break in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Clinical trials show that Prep significantly reduces HIV transmission among infected people.
Pre-release means that there are enough medicines in a person's body that prevent HIV infection.
These medicines may be taken daily or at the latest two hours before the break.
Suitable candidates for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsex people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and cannot be treated.
Clinicians identify suitable people who are willing to take part in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-stricken partner cannot receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a GP there will also be able to register their participation at the local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
It costs GBP 10 million and the NHS England has signed a contract to get medicines through this week following the international procurement procedure.
The aim of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of Prep by collecting clinical evidence of who the medicine is intended for and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new massive intervention should complement and amplify the extensive and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of the fight against one of the greatest health problems facing humanity. "
Deborah Gold, President of NAT, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
The Prep, if properly targeted to those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers the opportunity to reverse the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people with a high HIV risk in England, through this NHS-funded clinical trial, have access to a powerful new tool that is individually manageable and does not depend on negotiating with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, Executive Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "Now it is a priority to ensure that the clinical trial across the country is launched quickly and that no part of the HIV risk group is excluded.
Now that the Prep clinical test has been obtained, we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people at risk of HIV infection.
The shadow public health minister, Sharon Hodgson, said: "The start of the Prep clinical trial is very welcome and long overdue after months of delay and the consolation of the government's legs.
Evidence shows how big a change this medicine can bring to the prevention industry and to stop the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the advantages of Prep.
It is now important that the clinical trial is introduced as soon as possible in order to protect people who are exposed to HIV and take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society. "
The price of electricity in Estonia increased by 12%, while in Latvia and Lithuania it fell.
In July, the difference between the price areas of Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.94, compared to EUR 7.71 in June this year, according to Elering.
The main reason for this difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish connection.
In Estonia, the average electricity exchange target last month was EUR 34.33 per megawatt-hour, and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by 5% to EUR 36.27 per hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the price of the Nord Poland power exchange was EUR 26.37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices went up by 12 and 7 percent respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, 75% of the hours of last month moved to Estonia and 16% of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of hours between two countries did not happen in the next day transactions.
Between Estonia and Latvia, 99% of the time was moved from Estonia to Latvia and 73% of hours were used for all transmission capacity.
Transactions on the last trading day in July could result in an electricity exchange of about 34 euros in August and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affects the price of electricity generation, increased last month and transactions were carried out at a price of between EUR 5.04 and EUR 5.47 per tonne.
Living in High Court - semi-storey and smart designers have turned it into a small flat of the Earl Court
Joanne Leigh, a former banker, a passionate mortgage lender, changed his home in Knightsbridge in 2014 against the Earl Court's apartment.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace and the fact that Joanne has not packed his bags together and sold the apartment together is a tribute to the new design.
'Before that, I lived on a much larger surface with a former partner in Knightsbridge, 'said Joanne.
"I was looking for something equal to the price I offered.
I was shown this in the Earl Court's apartment and it had the same high ceilings.
I loved it and made an offer on the same day. "
Since the first visit, this apartment, which is 93 square metres, has been undergoing a full renewal.
In the beginning, it was an apartment with one sleeping room and a complicated layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to reach the sleep room. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a semi-floor in order to take advantage of high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, great windows, much light.
These were my demands, "he said.
He hired Erfan Azad Notting Hills, an architectural and design audit at Duck & Shed to take advantage of the 3.8 m altitudes and create a home that would not just be a development object but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-floors where one could stand.
Erfan had to take a creative approach.
"The forestry structure is rather complicated," he explains.
"We had to reorganise the rooms so that they would be on each other without bowing down.
It was not just building a platform, but we used a steel structure to ensure that the height of both the upper and the bottom were right. "
This regulation allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms in the room with a lot of dramatic elements.
From the pool, the ancient left-light window of Retruuvius opens to glamorous living space.
The golden furniture, silver components and re-herbaceous Serge Mouil light highlight the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatrical, spatial and light saturation.
Mirrors have been included at both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the other window of the room opens with a mirror.
At the entrance, the reflectance kit provides a storage space for all the tools and glass requirements of Joanne.
A magic solution is to close the kitchen if it is not used, creating an image of a glamorous space.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, this kitchen is also characterised by the fact that it is a garages-type door.
"This was a bit of a design effort," explains Erfan of the spoons of MDF with steel strength.
"It has a counterweight, so it glides very easily if it is pushed up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage, Joanne now has 16 extra square metres, an additional bedroom and a better flat.
"After all, the floor is what you sell - or what gives real estate value," says Erfan.
"The real estate agent enters an outdated form of a blind spot and makes calculations based on the surface area of the floor."
Here they have been able to increase the floor level using high-quality materials that add luxury to the space.
"The materials are the ones you touch and help create emotional ties with your home," says Erfan.
"You will not fall in love with an electric cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make your heart call. "
This shows that good design and increased surface area help to make quite something amazing about the ordinary apartment.
In fact, they may even give rise to a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
Dane Jensen, the leading figure in the Chicago cloud, is a major fan competing with a colleague for professional development.
The only thing that counts is the amount of money earned, by which all ethics are forgotten.
A man sees his wife and three children only early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I find myself thinking that it is a version of the business world of the 'card-maker' - even the speech manager of Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler is similar.
However, the less the film goes on, the less the schematic element there is, and the moralising intention of the film-makers is becoming more and more apparent.
A life-changing experience will be the illness of a son.
A choice must now be made between work and family life.
A son dreaming of Architecture makes his father, during his walks in Chicago, think about the big things that are really important, such as faith, goodness, love, and not even the twin towers being affected.
After the third scene where the son opens his father's eyes, one feels that the filmmakers have followed the goal of the audience to surely cry, because even the most hard-hearted observer is unable to keep the tears back in the face of the scary sick boy.
When the son of a coma falls and his situation looks hopeless, the father will finally understand the immorality of his work and will do a good deed to the old man looking for work.
Now I bet on my own bet - if the film has a happy ending, I will reward my discernment after the coffee break in the film, but if I am wrong, I could at least commend the scene for one surprise.
For a moment, there is a suspicion that I will be out of my clutter - when the husband calls the dane from the hospital and the man flows slowly through the corridor to the palace.
The son, however, has recovered wonderfully, and although his father has just lost his job, this is also positive, as there is now time to deal with his family.
I can also feel good - I can predict the end of the American drama quite well!
In all honesty, the film is well constructed; all the elements necessary for it exist.
Get angry, you can laugh, actors are good and moral beautiful: Money is not the most important thing in life.
I think it will bring the film well in.
The new head of staff plans to limit the President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do something about that.
In this case he would be the first.
Politico writes that the new Director of the White House plans to limit the flow of information that President Trump receives, including news, in the hope that it will keep the upper limit more even in the water.
Here is a section on reporter Josh Dawley:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with high officials on his first day, he identified a key problem with the President Donald's truer White House, which he was planning to resolve,poor information coming to the President's hands.
Kelly told officials that information must pass through him, whether on paper or in meetings, because the President would make better decisions if he were given good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis seems quite logical, but others have tried it and they have failed to tame its media consumption.
The President's more faithful relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he is in the White House, his TV-programming habits have not gone away.
"When the candidate Trump was annoyed about unfair media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was reported honestly in the publications affecting him," said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that 'the key to the management of Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a stable demoralised word'.
Fine.
But the idea that the more true Twitter usage habits have ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps those campaigning workers know something that the rest of us do not know, that the more faithful songs would have been even more exhilarating without these interventions.
We can probably never know about the compositions that Trump did not post.
If his helpers were able to save him a few times from evil, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent the more faithful from constantly causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in the White House of competing clichés try exclusively to promote their own interests by passing on to Trump material that supports their worldview, but is not always reliable.
In May, the whole story of Politico wrote about the willingness of the advisers to feed the President with strategically questionable information.
One example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is:
"The current and former, more faithful, say that Trump can respond to a negative press, particularly with damaging effects on leaks, exploding, obsessing with the identification of their source.
This was also the case at the end of February when someone accidentally gave the President a printed copy of an article on the website of Charles C. Johnson, according to GotNews.com, the chief of staff, Katie Walsh, accusing him of being a source of several information.
It makes no difference that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter for murder or that he did not provide any specific evidence or that he had in the past falsely prosecuted and withdrawn them.
The drum read the article and began to get round about Walsh, under the authority. "
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, and the Head of the White House, Rob Porter, "have tried to put in place a system for managing and documenting documents arriving at Trump."
How did it work?
Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader in Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants continue to compete for influence.
These constant factors make the Kelly mission very difficult.
Street computers coming from abroad to the capital cannot get permission to appear.
Many foreigners visit the city centre of Tallinn.
Those with whom it came to speak, admitted to playing in the old town without the permission of the city administration.
The first one was found by three street plants near the gate of Viru, who had taken the same number of dogs with them.
It was clear to see that musicians with tick boxes and explosive clothing were backbenchers who would have to take one shower out of the garden.
In spite of his appearance, the only woman in the company played a fun story on the chord, while a man at his side, with three balls, zhongled and called the furniture closer.
The third man had sat next to them in one of their backs and smoked their own cut-throat in their hearts.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing people.
When he played with Noemi and pallets, he said that he was playing on the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the meeting was to collect the ticket money for the ship travelling to Finland on the same day.
On the question of whether they asked for permission from the city to visit the old town, Noemi and Bob had their heads shaken.
Firstly, we did not know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple, and most often permits for a month or something like that.
There is no point in paying for it, "explained Bob.
When we got back to Viru gate about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were at the musicians and were driving them away.
The company moved to the intersection of the Viru Centre with browsers and dogs to experience happiness.
There were also three Polish young men on the streets of Viru, one of whom played the violin, the other played the piano, and the third had even carried an electronic piano.
"We are here to offer people entertainment to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living," explained the trio pianist Mivos.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that the permission of the city administration is required to appear.
'Of course we don't have it, 'he said, jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we will go elsewhere, but try it, 'he added.
In July, the Bank of Estonia purchased bonds amounting to EUR 149 million in the public asset purchase programme of the euro area's central banks, while the Bank's bond portfolio grew to a total of EUR 4.36 billion.
The Central Bank does not publish any more detailed information on purchases.
The President of the Estonian Bank, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained in response to the consultation of the members of the national assembly that there are three different purchasing plans for central banks in the Eurosystem: Blood bonds (ABS) and government bonds (SPP).
The Central Bank is buying bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Purchases have the effect of reducing returns on lower-risk assets, and this will motivate investors to take greater risks.
As a rule, a central bank purchases its own government bonds within the framework of a public-sector bond programme, while other countries' bonds are not purchased.
As the Estonian state has not issued the bonds, the Bank of Estonia is buying a replacement within the amount allocated to them.
It is also done by central banks in those countries where the supply of debt in accordance with the purchasing plans is limited.
According to Hansson, the Bank of Estonia generally buys bonds issued by the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and European Investment Bank.
As of March 2015, the Bank of Estonia will purchase bonds within the framework of the asset purchase programme.
In the meantime, Elering also acquired bonds, but from June 2016 the Bank of Estonia will no longer purchase Elering bonds.
In the name of the central banks of the euro area, Elering and the Estonian Energy Central Bank will purchase bonds from June.
Migrants ignore the tap and return to the "millionaire" district
Some of the most wealthy domestic owners of the West Midlands have once again found themselves in a fierce confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the councillor's digging trenches to win back the passage from their wild.
The travellers have parked their 20 shipwrecks on the border of the wealthy "millionaires" in the street Solihul.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and lorries after they were expelled only in May without being involved in a ditch digging a council to stop their invasion.
The usual group found itself in a weak position in the protection zones by closing down its vehicles from a blocking part that had been left on its feet.
The furious inhabitants are cursed with Solihul's council, saying that the council is' useless in dealing with the problem '.
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday evening after they were driven out of Bentley Heath, where they stoned their furniture.
The council must be ashamed of taking action because it is useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they are back again.
They came last night, probably more than that today. '
He added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such matters by putting up long barriers to protect its parks.
I live on the way to Streetbrook and I am not happy to have to continue paying the local council fee if the council cannot even prevent such a thing. "
A local resident, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said, 'It is ridiculous. We have only just seen the last of these travellers leave, and a new offensive is already taking place.
This time the number has increased, and even the horse has been seen in the hillside. "
He said: "We are aware that in the land close to Streetbrook, there is an unacceptable campsite and we are working with the Solihull police. We are taking the necessary legal steps to get them moving as quickly as possible.
It is very helpful to gather evidence if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by phoning number 101.
This will help to create an overview of the situation for the court when we present the case to them. "
The Weekend Festival is visited by, among others, the Culture Minister, Indruek Saar, who is pleased that it has been possible to bring real top names in the world to Estonia.
The question as to why the Weekend Festival is so important for Estonians is answered Saar that it should be asked by all those who enjoy the festival's three-day talk fully.
But he says that true men of his area have come to Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that has been brought to Estonia, the Minister of Culture speaks.
However, which artists appear at the festival to speak the island itself most?
I regard myself as a relatively old person and, for the elderly like me, there is certainly one of the most experienced artists - Armin van Buuren - who stood up last night.
According to his record, all of us have at some point turned our feet, "he says.
However, he still points out a number of names, for example, in the Chainskmokers, in the Dead5, in the Knife Party.
Of course, our own Estonian players: Starting from NOËP and they can be read in a whole series.
In reality, this well-known concentration of names is very large, "he says.

Audi updates car manufacturers in the middle of the criticism that hit them, with a total of 850 000 diesel vehicles;
The day before the Audi's announcement said BMW will offer a software delay to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the Chairman of the BMW, the company believes that 'there are smarter alternatives than driving restrictions', referring to European cities, including the BMW home town of Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
No company described these actions as recall.
European car manufacturers have been keen on promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered a carcinogenic substance and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles will increase for the car industry, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While the German car manufacturers are under in-depth investigation, the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of loosening the eyes of powerful car manufacturers and failing to mention the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid a repetition of Volkswagen's errors, which kept quiet about the use of so-called fraudulent data, allowing the display of exhaust gases to be adapted to the regulations during testing of the car, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen heads have been prosecuted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamic sub-division of the Audi Motor Development Department in Germany was arrested.
The former President, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may go to court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation concerning Volkswagen in Germany by the authorities accused of installing the Audi system to circumvent the requirements of European exhaust gas volumes, thereby expanding an investigation that had previously been focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may be a big blow to Volkswagen, The manufacturers of luxury cars generate a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
European Union flags are acquired for EUR 20 000 in Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education intends to purchase EU flags for the Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
In total, the European Union flag of 570 educational institutions receives 105x158 centimeters.
The flags are intended for display indoors, they must be performed in high-quality printed indoor spaces also with emotional recognition, and they pass through the ERR's news portal.
The flag of the Lippuvarda is the text: "A gift for Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is 20 000 euros, or one flag will cost 35 euros.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the weekly Rio de Janeiro usually gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinalo, sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and persistent drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They are told that it is important to change their routines.
Two parent writers are discussing which seems safer: Whether to bring children to their own office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
The security experts have written three words on the top of the space board: 'Enemies', 'neutral', 'allies'.
They ask reporters to provide each column with names, no evidence is needed, enough impressions and internal feeling.
Being employed by the government or by cartels suspects drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists, a whole list of bad guys who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
There is no respite from violence, and the more dead bodies accumulate across the country, the greater the number of journalists.
The last deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, Javier Valdez Cardenas, co-author of Rio de Janeiro.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence makes a deep sense, although his presence can be felt everywhere, The facade of the Rio building contains a large image of the middle finger-pointing Valdez with a letter of 'Justice' and two 30s reporters, Aaron Aaron a RAMIZ, on his face.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss the common trauma, their nightmare, sleep, paranoia.
Although the Public Prosecutor's Office was created in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, only two cases have been prosecuted, according to the Data Protection Committee for Journalists.
As in the case of most of the annual murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime, which amount to thousands, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Rio will continue to reflect the violence in Singapore, even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the information and justice of the murderers, the meeting on security, Ibarra said, will be of little use.
'It is very stupid to waste your time in this meeting, 'he says.
"As long as the cause is unknown, you will distrust everyone."
In the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the Rio office in the State capital, Culiacano.
He was forced to leave the car and was shot 12 times. It is supposed to be a newspaper because of the name, which translates as' the twelfth river '.
The armed man ran away in the Valdez car and made an accident in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She left behind a woman and two adult children.
Rumours are spreading freely in Culiacan.
However, there is essentially only silence on the Valdez dossier.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition of the United States in January, Sinalo has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, with rival clichés fighting to fill the power vacuum.
It makes no difference that a person or even several people are shot every day in the streets of Sinalo, or that the cemetery is full of decorated with the flavours of the double drug addicts, which are greater than the homes of many living.
Let us forget for a moment that the peacetime refers to the fact that the maritime state, with its valuable ports and drug routes to the United States, is governed by only one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Mr Valdez was thoroughly aware of the dangers of his work, the co-ordinator, Mr. Ismail Bojorquez (60), feels the enormous guilt for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two errors encouraged the killing.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with Guzman's sons and the war-torn cartel clique ninamenhe Lopez.
This book could provoke anger among the sons; all copies of the publication were bought by suspected gangs as soon as they arrived in the newspapers.
The second mistake was that Mr Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid took place in a newspaper article that reported the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had remained alive for so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to be permanently present.
He was a veteran reporter to Noroete in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Rio by selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that 'it was impossible to deal with the press without tackling the drug problem'.
For a long time, the newspaper gained a reputation with its courageous and honest coverage, and sales and advertising grew.
The reporters liked to publish vigorous studies without the fear of censorship and the readers in more enchanting publications from which they could read stories that no one else dared to report.
Eight years after Rio was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its Latin American coverage.
In the same year, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) won the International Prize for Freedom of the Press for its courage to follow the Mexican narcotic everywhere it takes.
He openly admitted that he feared.
"I want to live on," he said when receiving the AKK Prize.
Last October, he said in an interview given to the television channel Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinalo.
"You have to take on the task that the journalist's office is carrying out; the other option is to play fools.
I do not want to be asked what I did when faced with so many deaths or why I did not speak what was going on. "
The Rio Group yearns for Valdez, a joke who roasted like madrus, a friend who kindly shared the values and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office across the road to the El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they are asking whether his routine love became fatal for him.
His death has also made them question how best to do their work and live.
'They do not like to get hold of these women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret detention facilities used to transport drugs'.
"These things could not have been touched," said Bojorquez.
The result is strong self-censorship and self-preservation even in the best of times.
Trusting your instincts.
If it breaks down suspicious, keep out.
According to the editor Andres Villarori, the problem is that "the smell of the brain can be deceived... and that is what happened with Javier."
He and others are saying that the old rules no longer apply in Sinalo, Veracruz, Guerrero, or in other states that are home to lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt forms of association between state officials.
The landscape is changing all the time.
Suddenly, in the space where the Rio workers met for security training, mobile phones were no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that the spying on governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico only.
In front of the house, two police officers were looking for relief from 40 degrees of heat in the shadow of a tree.
The government ordered them to guard the Rio office, which is located in a four-storey building in the vicinity of the Culiaca middle class.
Some of the reporters pondered half-jokingly whether these police officers are part of the 50% police force whose governors themselves have found it unreliable.
Several months have passed since reporters have travelled to mountainous regions where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
Rio this week gave three main stories.
One of them was the murder in Sinalos of the former poxile Legion Julio Cesar Chavez Venna.
In addition, they had a revealing story of government money being spent on the governor's home town.
A group of people were abducted from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter of the public prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so care had to be taken when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows, the restaurant is a favourite with drug traffickers and authorities.
The reporter found out in public documents that the restaurant is registered in the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all policy levels for almost the whole of the last century.
Recently, a number of IRA governors have been accused of corruption in cases with wide coverage.
Villarral asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of El Chapo in the name escaped from the military raid.
Just a few months earlier, the readers would have searched the Valdez column for information on the abduction from the best sources.
'We would have known what happened before, 'said Villarral, who is 46 years old, and whose body construction has served him a nickname El Flaco.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have stopped."
The Valdez office has become a deposit market for labels and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and the editorial staff have become something they never expected, activists on behalf of the press.
The reporter Miriam RAMIREZ still seized the couple and next morning went to the office of the local prosecutor for demonstrating for another journalist.
Salvador Adam disappeared in the western state of Michacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
A burnt body has been found and, according to officials, it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vociferous and criticise the phrase 'SOS press' as an organised protest against pavements and buildings.
On that day, President Bojorquez will be in Washington trying to build international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after the death of Mr Valdez, meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa, RAMIREZ accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After this he requested that he be diverted from the government's activities by showing concern that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "in step" by organised crime, complicit public officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book entitled 'Arctic journalism', he wrote that reporters not only kill drug gangs, but also take place at the behest of politicians and security forces who are in cahoots with organised crime.
Media monitoring group articulo 19 attributed more than half the attacks on journalists to the police and public authorities last year.
"You will die in Mexico, because you will be silenced," said RAMIREZ.
The murders are obviously behind the scenes.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Maciase in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter which was probably signed by the cartel Los Zetas: "I am here for my reports."
The computer keyboard and the headphones were lying next to her abandoned head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, for example the newspaper El Norte in Chihuauas in the northern border country after the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others will continue to do as El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did following the murder of their President in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke publicly about drug fear in front of the newspaper, 'What do you want of us?'.
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even their country.
It is a bitter decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile and they still have to wade through the streets in order to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they are driven, as was probably the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in 2015 in a Mexico apartment three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
Those who stay and continue to work have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wished to become a poet, admits that reporting on a drug frightens him.
'Mexico is on its way to hell and that's why I started reporting, 'he said.
During the midnight of one of the recent Friday when the latest number had already been knocked down, the Rio editors sat in front of the office walking in front of the office and scratched beer when suddenly everyone's phones started to vibrate.
In the resort town of Mazatlan on the coast, 19 people were killed, according to confirmed data, in a fire between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as was the commitment of many out-of-hand messages from cartels found in the region.
On the edge of the pavement, reporters put news on the Rio website using a mobile phone.
The front cover of the next day needed to be changed.
The Sirens culminated along the, another fire in the region.
Mr Bojorquez had a look at the police officers on the watch to see if they are vigilant.
If they were afraid, at least they did not show it.
Under the massive portrait of the founder of the newspaper, on which his average ring is to be seen throughout Sinaloe, the Rio workers carried in his footsteps.
'How can we think of closing altogether, 'said Bojorquez,' when on the same day that Javier was killed, the trainee asked me to send him to the streets to report? '
The dinosaur used a defence colour to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a shape, though quite scary.
Scientists have now made public the first findings regarding the channelling of a miner with the incredible depth of the rhinoceros which has survived so well that experts have described it as' the dinosaurs Mona Lisa '.
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the leather covered with his armour was a colour of red brown, and his past had been somewhat "complicated."
A report published in the Current Biology magazine described the essence as' the best preserved Finno-Ugric market ever found 'and as' one of the best dinosaurs in the world '.
Fossil is a new form of Nodos vapor living in the middle of the crisis period, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good survival was shaken by the scientists who describe it as' truly remarkable '.
This,
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn funk when he was mine at the Sunstone Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta.
He hit something that did not resemble a surrounding stone, and decided to investigate further.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrel Palace Museum.
For the next six years, work was carried out on digging the plot of GBP 2 500 (1 100 kg).
After all this hard work, the final result is now finally ready to be made public.
"If you are a little looking, you can almost believe that he is sleeping," said Caleb Brown, the leading author of the Royal Tyrrelli museum, who exhibits his being.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Appendix of the dinosaurs."
When he examined the skin, the scientists found that this vegetarian food, although covered with Finns and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely to be seriously threatened by meat-food dinosaurs.
This dinosaur, with so many Finns, used a red and white defence colour to hide from the predators and applied a shadow technology called an emergency offer, which is also used by many animals today.
This enabled, according to experts, the dinosaurs to merge better and the enemies to be avoided, as the larger dinosaurs were more likely to hunt them down.
The existence of this 110 million-year-old Nodosauce family first came to the news in May and is now being visited by the Royal Tyrrel Palace Museum.
The researchers have now studied being and named Borealis after the Mar Mitchell laboratory of the Museum, who was a member of a team that spent more than 7 000 hours on the difficult detection of the animal.
Thanks to her amazing preservation, Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists had the opportunity to document the shape and size of the Finns on the body.
They discovered a Statement of Objections - a common method of protection in the animal country, which means that the surface of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although the reception offer is widespread, the findings come as a surprise, as the Borealisope animals are much bigger than the animals living in reception facilities today.
This implies that the dinosaur was sufficiently cooled by other musculoskeletal organs, that evolution preferred to be overshadowed by a guarantee of survival rather than confrontation.
But most of the animals that use modern reception systems - e.g. elves, uncles or armadillo - are much smaller and more vulnerable, which suggests that the Nodos aurus had to make a real effort to survive.
"The vigorous hunting of the dinosaurs covered with huge numbers of Finns shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the crisis could be," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists will continue to create research to get clues about this life, including the content of this bowel movement, to find out what the animal's last meal was eating.
They believe that the dinosaur collapsed through the river, thus reaching the sea with a flow of water where it sunk back in front of the ocean floor.
At that time Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida and rivers and oceans were likely to reach the hinterland much further than they are today.
"This Nodosaurus is truly remarkable, as he is fully covered by the preserved Finnish skin, while he remains of three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the criterium.
You don't have to use a lot of imagination to rebuild it - it's just a matter of wringing your eyes and you seem to be sleeping. "
The crisis era was a time when the Earth was engulfed in vast two-footed dinosaurs - thermometers.
Although all of them, King Tyrannosaurus, had lived millions of years later than Borealisope, this armoured dinosaur could be chased by some of its frightening predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and six tons of weighing monsters.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealis is a fan of the bedroom after the death in the sea and it mumiphitis mud.
It was discovered on 21 March 2011 by Shawn funk when he was mine at the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is best preserved in the Finnish dinosaur market in the world, including skin and Finns, and it is integrated from concentration to rain.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five metres) long and weighed up to GBP 3 000 (1300 kg).
Two of the 20-duty-length oracles burst from its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this,
But the sea-bed of the dinosaur helped preserve its Finns in great detail.
The remains of this particular individual have been preserved to such an extent that the skin remains are still covered by the imposition of the mgaric armour-plating.
As he wrote in Michael Greshko's journal National Geographic: "Such a conservation degree is as rare as a lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The remains of the hardened skin still cover the deep-water species of the animal.
The better the foreleg lies next to him, and five toes are straightened up.
I have the opportunity to count Finns who are at his stable. "
How did one of the activists find an answer to the question "Kelle streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittan Ferrell received a complete shock.
Just one day after travelling to New York, this resident of St. Louis, via Airbnb, sat in a room on beds, straight over the phone on Facebook.
He fell apart from his former fellow schoolmaster's post.
It read: 'The police has just killed an 18-year-old lad and he is still lying on the street'.
He was confused as to why nobody else had posted this information on his stream, so he closed down Facebook and opened Twitter.
With the handle @ TheePharoah user posts were repeatedly shared in his timeline.
Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black young man killed by a white policeman in Ferguson Missouri, was broadcast live by a sniper from the St. Louis region.
He posted a picture of Brownian's living body lying in the street for four hours.
"It's crazy," thought Ferrell himself.
But death was nothing new for him or for the community.
He put his phone away but saw later in the evening again a spark which this time announced the gathering of people on the Canfield Drive.
Photos of a police officer and a gruesome person were shared, and of a man who claimed to be the father of Brownian and still kept a letter: 'The FERGUSON police killed just my unarmed son!'
He watched in real time a stream of police officers standing in front of a group of protestors with a tomb dog.
In another video, another policeman, according to him, sounded like a gun and shouted: 'I kill you all... animals'.
Ferrelli reminds me of how he hit himself with a thought: 'It is unusual'.
"This is not a kind of murder to which we are accustomed and which we could call typical."
At that moment, I felt tyrants.
I was angry and I wept. "
He booked a return flight and sailed the next day home.
Having landed at 23, he went after his father to his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would travel the next morning with two FERGUSON.
What happened with Ferrelli and Ferguson over the next three years is the central theme of a new documentary entitled 'What Streets?', which will appear in cinemas on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and tenacity for those who live in this community and who filled the streets in demanding answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter - who had a flowery dress and had a suitable chrome on their backs - travelled to FERGUSON, they talked again about the black skin experiences and living conditions they had heard about before this morning.
'Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights? 'He reminds himself.
'We are currently travelling to FERGUSON because an 18-year-old boy was killed by the police and that is not right '.
'i could not take him, 'said Ferrell later.
"What is happening now is... the culmination of the past.
He must know and see it and grow in the midst of it.
He must learn about activism and organisation, and at the same time learn about different layers of black experience and living conditions and what we must do to become free and free ourselves.
Even if I succeed in bringing him up so that he does not personally experience blatant racism, he is no different from another black girl.
I feel I would do him a disservice if I protected him from this world. "
The first one, which they did when they arrived at FERGUSON, was on their way to South Florida - a place left over the road from the police station, which had become a kind of camp where the activists were waiting for news about Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who made lunch.
They put together food bags and helped distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrelli, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he said, noting that, when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louise, he was President of the Union of Learners and focused on inequalities in food and health in black communities.
"I had no organisational experience.
It's all just about it. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met a film co-director of Sabaah Folayan during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and the film operator, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, simply wanted to document what was going on.
The question arose in Mrs Ferrelli 'Do you try to record what was going on or find a story to be used?'
This scepticism was the result of countless cases where people - often white people - come into the community and try to profit from its pain and durability.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voice of the people born and raised in Ferguson was not heard and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already given his hands to the co-director, Damon Davis, an artist in the region known for his activism in the prisoners sentenced to death.
His involvement made the project attractive to Ferrelli and another six other local people who were watched by the team after the Brown shooting for years.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or us, but we speak for ourselves," said Davis.
"For me, it was important how these people are portrayed, because that is how I am portrayed."
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrelli's experience - it was intended to show that the movement was not a "redeemer" but a community meeting, "as Folayan said, it became the most open player in the film.
As a result, records "white streets?" Surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as pardon and marriage with his wife.
'i felt as if I were naked, 'said Ferrell, smiling at the first time he had seen the tape.
'But I understood that this work and humanity of black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability. '
Moreover, Ferrelli's story emphasizes and places the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black live Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement who, after the killing of black teenage Trayvon Martin by the social media in 2012, developed the hashtag # BlackLiveMatter, are homosexual.
"In the leading role, black homosexual women have generally maintained the movement," says Ferrell, "and this is precisely because we have to fight on several fronts all the time.
Black homosexual women must carry all this burden. "
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed held alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women."
He claims, however, that 'this is not some kind of equal opportunities thing' - Mr Ferrelli was not selected to be the focus of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who was emitting the right energy," he said.
"But it's no coincidence that he was located right on the front line, because living as a black homosexual woman in such knots has a lot at stake.
His energy can be felt through the display. "
Meanwhile, the news camera on Ferguson has long disappeared, but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile.
The suspended sentence imposed on Ferrelli during the demonstration for road blocking will last another 2.5 years.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area he calls home, simply as a 'state of affairs'.
Nevertheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra which he has eaten since he took to the streets of FERGUSON no less than three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains. "
7. How to get over the poems after Weekend
Some of the strong men will find the feast, after the nappies, that in need, it will help.
Or based on the saying "avoid the pohmelli, a steady stream."
But this is only the inevitable postponement and a proper drought for health.
What can you do to get over yourself in the morning, after today's and tomorrow's Weekendi tral - or any other party - in the morning, to feel better and make the best out of the cheek?
Yeah water.
Alcohol under and after, after a great party in the morning... or possibly even alcohol instead.
Since the body loses alcohol when consuming a lot of fluid, it must somehow be recovered.
Along with water, minerals are also released from the body and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the sleep is often irritated after use, it is especially good when it is bubble-free or just slightly gassed.
Go and walk.
It would certainly not be worth going to the grandmother to burst the trees, which could prove to be a fatal misjudgement.
But a light walk helps the body to recall what it feels like to be alive again.
Lying in the tent and sleeping with pohmas is a more time-consuming way of getting healthy.
Give your body the energy back slowly and cautiously.
If you are already drinking fat from yesterday, you should definitely not try to load a sausage with high fat debris.
Start with fresh juice, which contains fruit sugar to quietly wash your body.
If the health of the southern regions is already suffering, you could try, for example, a powder keg.
And a little later already back.
Avoid the coffee.
This diuretics releases your body from every last water.
As has already been said: Water and juice are your friends.
Do not contribute to painkillers.
If you take a pohmelli to prevent pain relief, your tax will have to deal not only with alcohol, but also with paradise or ibuprofen and will therefore lose performance.
In this way, you will break your liver even more and in the future will be pohmad worse.
In addition, pain relief does not stay very long in the body anyway.
When you take pain relief in the morning, do not do it with a full empty stomach - it irritates your already dirty sleep.
Or if you don't take a partner, you can do well with yourself.
It works about the same way as walking, but you can't walk an orgasm.
But avoid too active a tempo and too much porous - the physical effort should be moderate during the pohmelli.
Make a joke.
The story of the friends and fellow-sufferers of the time was stupid, make easy fools and laugh amicably about themselves and others (suffering).
The joke and the laughter might not drive the poacher away, but it is certainly more fun to put up with them.
Once upon a time, the pohmell goes over anyway!
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University staff are sought for suspected murder
According to the police, there is a national search for a professor at the University of Northwestern and an employee at the University of Oxford who has become suspects after finding the bodies of a people in Chicago on a luxury card with lethal push wounds.
According to the Cook County judicial documents, on Monday, 42-year-old Wyndham Latham and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were arrested on charges of first-instance murder on account of their alleged involvement in the Trenton H. Cornell.
According to the documents, the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranau died after repeated push.
According to the warning issued to the community by the Chicago police station, the dead body was discovered on 27 July.
Police officers received a phone call and found the Grand Plaza apartment building in exchange for the victim, whose body had several brass doors.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranau has been declared dead and investigators are treating push-ups as murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
He has been a co-Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for Public Relations at the University, said in a statement sent in an e-mail that Lathem has now been temporarily out of work and has been banned from entering the towns of Northwestern University.
"This is a criminal case now being investigated by the competent authorities and the University of Northwestern Austria is cooperating with investigators," said Mr Cubbage.
Warren is a senior member of the finance department of Oxford University.
A university and a representative of the Somerville College said in a statement in an email: 'We have been in contact with the British police and ready to assist US investigating authorities in any way we can'.
In addition, it was written that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give himself up.
Anthony Guglisei, head of the Communication Division in Chicago Police Department, urges suspects to give himself up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea where they are staying, but we are increasingly working on the definition of the exact location," said Guglielmi.
According to Guglittes, both local, regional and national authorities are helping to identify suspects.
Gugliudet said that the police received a telephone call from the Grand Plaza apartment administrator, who had just received a cryptic hint that something had happened in the apartment No. 1008.
According to police descriptions, it was perhaps a sight.
It is not clear, according to Gugliemi, whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said that the sheltered cameras confirmed the presence of Lathemi and Warren in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," added Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza leadership sent a letter to the population: 'The police are currently working to establish the chronology of events and background of the victim and are examining various motives, including the possibility of a family dispute'.
Start-ups that help your company to avoid becoming next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure his e-commerce start-up company's satisfaction, but the polls were futile.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse still, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some staff did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who is running an e-commerce company that sells hair care products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called to the rescue of external persons.
New types of start-ups dealing with human resources are emerging, which will help companies find out what their employees know.
By developing and licensing software with the firm aim of measuring employee involvement, they allow companies to perform sudden interviews, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with an anonymity and a hotline, and, in some cases, allow managers to switch directly to C boards.
"Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are designed to monitor health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" Said Jim Barton, co-author and CEO of Redwood City start-up company Glint, whose software tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
Errett said he had received three years in which he had used Glint, a much better insight into what he workers think and feel.
In addition to summary examinations and surveys directed at specific teams, this provides a heat exchanger for the company, which provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support to enable him to identify the causes.
Companies are beginning to understand that they need to keep up with their culture of work in order not to become the next Uber, which has been rotten in scandals since the former employee published a blog post that described the oppressive environment in which those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation and compliance may be worth more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020, according to Let's Talk Payens' data.
The company Convercent, based in Denver Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, noted this year an increase in interest and activity in the context of the dubious reputation of Uber.
There are almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent allows companies to send customised pulses, collect confidential answers in real time and watch the heat funds from problem areas.
It also provides anonymous messages that allow employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when the managing director is concerned, complaints go directly to the management board.
"Public opinion has been usurped by regulatory authorities," said Patrick Quinn, founder and CEO of Convercenti.
Mr Quinlan said that, if a company is found to treat its employees badly or to behave unethically, it could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, dismissal of workers and court cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
The RUBY Tuesday, a restaurant with more than 25 000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and procedures and offer easy access to the headquarters of the company.
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find a telephone number or email address of the corporation's headquarters, submit an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a discouraging and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday's general adviser, James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to monitor workers' complaints.
However, now that the company is using Convercenti, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that did not previously reach managers who were active in offices in other cities or States could be identified and dealt with more quickly.
"I can get closer to the employees" holistic 360 degree experience, "said Vitrano, who is leading a Ruby Tuesday risk management group.
"And we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with employees."
Mr Quinlan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed on the Enron scandal.
However, it was only when the 'social media' developed that companies realised that they could not stop their black market washing openly on the web.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service by periodically charging companies for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors, who have supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercenti financed companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Customs Capital to the tune of USD 47 million.
Glint invested $10 million in Bessenmer Venture Partners in November, increasing the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments will not come as a surprise, given the interconnectivity of companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that modern workers expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, there are high wages and interesting projects only on the table.
The workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission.
"If people are happy in the company, feel that they are being listened to and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of the staff's department Linkedt Ini, which uses Glintuiti.
Investors will earn money if the companies they represent are doing well; companies will do well if employees are committed and involved.
If the third party's analytical tools allow greater commitment and involvement of employees, it is no wonder that they will receive support.
Having data on employee involvement is important according to job culture experts.
However, these data are useless if the company's successors do not add anything to them.
In fact, when a company asks its employees for feedback, it can create expectations that changes will be made.
And if changes do not occur quickly enough or not at all, this can cause disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
'When you ask for 4 000 proposals, you must be ready for 4 000 conversations, 'said Russell Raath, President of the Consultation and Business Administration, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too heavily on data collection.
'For if things are not brought to an end, the workers will think: 'Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care? ""
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now organises six studies among employees, has been able to take action on the same day when the problem has been reported through Glintum.
And after receiving feedback from employees who have been disappointed in the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, he was able to restructure several teams within the company and offer communication training to deal with problems.
However, the RUBY Tuesday gathers new data on workers and it is hoped that in the long term this will lead to the long-term commitment of workers in the industry, which is known for its high labour flow.
"If you are not committed to transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, then you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose the companies. "
The bright star of the euro area is the Baltic States: Incomes are growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic States, the three Baltic States are rapidly moving closer to the rich countries of Western Europe, Mr Bloomberg writes in referring to the European Central Bank report.
According to the Central Bank's data, since 1999, the gross domestic product per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
This success is due to low debt levels, rapidly improving institutions and a business-friendly and free-market policy.
"The Baltic States, along with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where real-GDP per capita purchasing power has substantially moved closer to the EU average," the Central Bank announced.
Although the goal is that the total per capita output of the economy should be equal to that of the wealthiest Western Europe, in 2015, the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was just 2 / 3 of the average of 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement.
Low wages have led the Baltic to look for better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic countries in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, the local people are not at all enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the inhabitants of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well, or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, less than half of those surveyed considered this to be the case for their national economies.
NCAA's decision to cancel twice a day's training makes Bruins days long
It is nearly 23 o'clock when the trolley UCLAF footballers stop at the edge of a new training square in the university city of the crew.
Some of them have peered on their backs, revealing the back of the sweat's first day effort in their training camp.
For a large part of the team, they are catching up at midday.
After three hours of training, players taking part in summer courses would go back to the joint chamber to study for the final examinations before returning for meetings at 6.30 a.m. next morning in the Wassenman Football Centre.
'The next three days will be a real test for them, 'said Jim Mora, the Bruins, shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA decision to cancel training sessions that are held twice a day in order to reduce the burden on players has in fact made their days longer - at least until the final examinations are completed on Friday.
For this reason, UCLAF's first three training sessions were scheduled to start at 19.15 in order to fit in with the already tight schedule of players.
The move from two to a day means more than one training days - the start of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season and for the first time during the six Westwood seasons, training courses were held during summer courses.
They are planning 18 training sessions until 20 August before the formal preparations for the opening match against Texas A & M will start in September.
Mora says that she is in favour of the NCAA rule change, although it adds another item to the busy schedules of players.
"They have an enormous burden on three or four days and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they are breaking through this challenge; they are struggling, they are good young.
I believe that when we come on Saturday and have more time it will be a real pleasure. "
Once the camp is over, UCLAF's training will be closed, which is not an easy task, given the clear view of the parking spot close to the squares and the remote Luski centre, a higher class hotel that has already got out of the protective network.
From this weekend, the hotel's Bruins played, but Mora admitted that problems could arise with free rooms during the season.
'We are taking security measures, 'said Mora.
"This is a real concern and it is no exaggeration to think that people can rent a room and train there.
If you have a record of training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we use the security team there and the 8th parking spot.
We will do our best, using what we can.
I am not particularly concerned about this.
We have a plan in place. "
In retaliation, the election union of Savisaari-Ivanova born to the Central Party, Kristiina Ojuland expelled from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljute, founded upon the association of forces to leave the Central Party, seem to be showing hope of a union of businessmen at least the same number in the local election campaign.
However, carrots will be counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there are enough frustrated voters for all of them.
Who remains with Savisaari?
If the small number of supporters of Edgar Savisaare reduced, one can guess at the events that were organised to honour his electoral union.
One member of the national assembly, some former and current central figures and many unknown faces - will that be the composition of the electoral union?
And why are some of Savisaare's faithful friends and supporters of the Savisaari people who are standing in Tallinn, looking to see that the 'Savisaare list' of the perpetrators of corruption and those suspected of corruption crimes is becoming a reality?
A video of music filmed on the roof of the city of Lasnamäe for the Russian-speaking pop song with the elderly in Lasnamäe; and a primitive computer game in every sense in which the prime minister Jüri Ratas is required to avoid voters on the wheels being allowed to go in 17 years?
We look forward to seeing what other political parties think of a youth-oriented election campaign.
If Canada 2 or TV3 viers watch a black square instead of entertainment since early August, they have two options: To accept that only ETV, ETV, ETV +, Tallinn and the English-speaking France24 can be released from service providers every month.
There are probably also those who, in the first place, are publicly rejoicing at the non-promotional television experience, but in the end, albeit reluctantly, they pay for television pictures and advertising.
Murky music, the Latvian people and the junk that is left on the streets are unpleasant side effects on almost every major music festival.
If you don't want to get a share of the noise, it's worth going home to find your home country rather than pain your head at home - and you can leave the place of sleep to the festival guests for a hefty amount.
Washington changes Green Card rules
Media sources quote President Donald's truer, who said that a new US immigration plan is planned which will change the rules of the Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people per year, stricter rules for the acquisition of temporary employment visas and restrictions on family orientation visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The draft law will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way in which US citizens issue green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and will replace the current programme.
The new application process will give an advantage to candidates speaking English, who will have the funds to support themselves and the skills to benefit our economy, "said Trump in the US media.
The young people in the Siberian uncle will move to the city, the pensioners will return to the land.
Yevseev's Anatoly continues the tradition of the famous uncle's gold miners on the former land.
He works 140 kilometres from home in the area of the tributaries of the Moon as a gold driver.
It is a tough job: Two months in a row without rest days 12 hours of work and then only ten days at home and again back.
Artellis worked for three years and Anatoly continued to see gold only once.
'There's a hard time: When you go in, you're thoroughly checked to ensure that you don't bring the wine, and when you go out so that you don't take the gold, 'says Anatoly.
Mare Piho spoke in the village of Haida with the local uncle Jani, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The ancient culture of Siberia still preserved will also affect the home-Setos, because it is just so shocking, thinks the most deeply distant Setos studied by Piho Mare.
This year, 30 years have passed since his first investigation trip to Siberia.
During this time he has been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many adjustments were still travelling to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in order to gain land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I claim to 8000.
I have taken this into account according to the stories of the Siberian men who have thought about it.
It is hard to say, because up to 30 people could come in one group at that time, but only a man was given a passport.
The passport was given to just one, but there were children, sisters, and female relatives.
Look at how great this territory was here.
It was several times larger than the historical Setomata.
It had to be educated, managed in some way.
Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed because here they ended up in areas that were not only agricultural, but also river (palm-shaving), gold mining, industry.
For example, many in New Petseri went to work in the city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (where the Soviet power built a uranium enrichment facility - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did Setot then form a majority of the population in this region?
Yes, they lived in compact ways.
In addition, the tradition of marriage and multi-childliness remained for a long time.
Seven to eight children in the family were common.
How much of the Siberian Setos culture was different and different from the Setos of the Mother Earth?
They are different, although what was brought here was never the same there.
They brought with them very many folk clothes.
They also made their own contribution (folk clothes), but they always made a distinction between what was brought along and what was done here.
Traditional clothing was strongly influenced by climate change because it is colder here.
Food changed.
For example, secondary meat salts, but here it was just frozen.
Where are the Siberian Setos villages and what life is there for? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The communications with the mother country were spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that this Setumaa will now give back there, will affect them.
These girls who have lived here in families have heard amazing stories.
Piho is thinking of the people of the Estonian delegation to the Setos who came to the Kingdom of Haida at the beginning of July and lived four days in their homes - J. P.
What is still here is shocking.
"It's so easy to come and go, because the city has an excellent location: At the rail hub and at the point of crossing the roads," says Reigo Tamm, an opera friend from Tapla.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have plenty of nature, sports and cultural sites, and the seal can be reached at every corner.
Way is the top-top-top city!
There are small islands in the White River running through the city, where the public tend to hold the ostracism.
'This beautiful place from the railway window does not look, 'says Reigo.
Anyone who is not afraid of cold water can swim in this river, because the river is full of sources.
I have been swimming there, I can manage it!
The water on the river can be regarded as a picnic and can simply be used as a romance - the river can be seen and thought for life and behind it.
I have also walked there with my bride.
Besides everything else, the Oder Tamm has gone on a river bridge between the three bridges, becoming accustomed to its Aryans: "That this place is near the city, no one will ever be able to come back if their stories are circular."
"There is a wonderful view of Tapa on the mountain, but there are also health lanes where you can run, skiing in winter, and now, for example, discogolf play - golf courses have been made, chains can be borrowed from the sports center," says Reigo.
Old Prophets of course go there with their discs, but I haven't yet got to play there.
I think that Mrs Rasmus KULL should be invited to the village of Takala, because she has experienced a disc player and she has chains.
Perhaps he will lend me!
Reigo and Männingö were inseparable from the childhood of this opera.
At least during skiing hours.
There are many tears, many disappointments left on this mountain and you can enjoy my sporting life.
Not to mention the wrecked snows and mouths.
"The whole central city is now full of construction works, all this becomes unknown," Reigo says.
The habit of old and tired panel building, however, is a very attractive place where the summer solstices are played.
I am pleased that in 2012, the leader of R.A.A.A.M., Märt Meos, accepted my idea and had to make an independent summer theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with Alexey Karenin has just ended, on 11 August there will be a railway station called 'Life Awareness' when the old factory was moving around in the 1980s.
"From 11 to 13 August, the City of Tapa has a day of waking up to open homes and a series of cultural events, including a popular rally," says Reigo, who is proposing to visit a town of 91one in those days.
The museum has been located in the small yellow house on the wooden walls of 1 May 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are very much and information huge," commends Reigo's place, which is full of the history of Tapa City, most of which focuses on rail and military.
Reigo by the way, that once the Tapal's recommended sites are completed, the stomach will be empty for a long time, but fortunately the small town is full of cafés.
"We have such good eating places, and sitting in cafés sometimes gives the feeling that you are abroad," he describes.
Well educated and young soldiers from Tapala spend a lot of time in pubs, so it is a strange feeling sitting there that you are in Estonia and in your home town, but there is such an international community around.
I believe it would be very exciting to hear the stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we move a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping
The television channel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
On the morning of 1 August, the police arrested a group of people who had illegally been executed on the Sichonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but an investigation is now under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on television television that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already imposing severe penalties on all those who are caught in resting places, which are not provided for.
Inspections will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The wolves teach the puppies, they go to the sheep.
After a break of one year, the farmers in Hiiumaa are again forced to give 'educational material' to the wolves from their herds, which have apparently been taught by the wolves.
This year, wolves in the Hiiu county have broken sheep three times, 23 sheep and eight have been injured, according to Hiiu's page.
Last year, the number was only three, one year before 124.
The information from the Environment Agency that the wolf nest was not born last year in Hiiumaa and that of the Hiiumaa hunting council are fixed this year on the island.
In the village of Kabuna, 15 sheep were burnt down by wolves on the night of Monday, and 18 surviving sheep were injured.
In the early morning of Wednesday, the wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of the village of Rehesel and seriously injured another who had to undergo an emergency killing.
Rules on genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a co-ordination on the draft Act on the Environment of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and the draft Act amending the Plant Protection Act.
The amendment of the law removes the need to create a separate database for the locations of both genetically modified (GM) crops and for business operators, which will henceforth be used in the Plant Health Register.
In addition, the obligation for GM crop handlers to have a person dealing with beekeeping within the prescribed radius will be amended.
Although no GM crops are currently being grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non-GM crops.
At least until Estonia has decided to declare GM-free, "said Sigmar Su, Head of the Plant Health Department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"However, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and national sectors."
The draft act repeals provisions relating to the collection and training of data on the locations and handlers of GM crops and to training in the handling and handling of GM crops, lays down requirements for the handling of GM crops and for starting an economic activity.
Specifically in relation to beekeeping, the current obligation for GM crop growers to inform beekeepers about the establishment of GM crops by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeepers before starting their cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to read the drafts in the information system and if they wish to submit their views to the Ministry of Life.
The planned changes will affect in particular those involved in plant breeding, beekeepers and the Agricultural Agency.
Only one GM crop - MON 810 - is authorised for cultivation in the European Union, including Estonia.
So far, however, none of the Estonian farmers have been interested in the cultivation of GM crops.
This is due to the fact that Estonia does not have a maize controller, a European arm that is resistant to MON 810.
Its corn varieties are also bred for the southern regions and this maize is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In order to obtain assurance, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies into the seeds of various varieties of summer months, maize and soybean grown in Estonia for the detection of pollution with potential GMOs in 2015 and 2016.
The analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds were not genetically modified and the study concluded that seeds of oilseed rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
From the above, it can be concluded that no genetically modified crops are deliberately grown in Estonia and that no accidental contamination has occurred either.
Jose Mournho thinks that Manchester United colours Nemanja Maticus in the form of "genius"
Jose Mournho believes that Manchester United has recruited Nemanja Maticus as a 'genius' after a central player in Sampdoria opposed to Wednesday night's conduct.
The 40 million pounds bought from Chelsea started winning 2-1 in the last pre-season match in Dublin before the UEFA Super Cup Real Madrid in the beginning of Tuesday, giving an impression in the defence role, while Paul Poetkaba and Paul Perrecently gained a.
However, having stayed away from the Asian culture before the Blues season, Matic urgently needed a match and he held only 45 minutes.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant way of thinking - he has a football mindset," said Mourinho.
"Let's help him get the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, in the opening line of the Aviva stadium, other new recruited Victor Lindelf and Romelo Luka began, and Mourinho quietly started to put one of his preliminary men in place by the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho would still like to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed that the club had already done a "excellent job" by concluding contracts with three of his four priority choices.
"I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another round of gender tests took place on the foot of the GSM transmitter on 1 August and this time in Muhus.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird-watching bird-eye in the Ring, this nest is already flying round, has left the nest and joined the large night-stream of Mullutu Bay.
This is because the Ring is not a field of fruit, the Saarte Häälä writes.
On this Tuesday, already rather late in the day, to ring the cucumbers, there was another tragedy on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, installing transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojas.
Last year, a tragic experiment with the GSM transmitter of Mati Sõlves Türk was provided.
"His activities are all online: How he went into winter in Spain, came back a long time to the German-Polish border and Saaremaa came," Martin said.
A British inventor allowed a microchip to be installed in his body to get into the house and car with a hand-held passport
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he can only open his front, get into the office and even launch the car with a hand touch.
Steven Northamp, a 33-year-old man, had to put a tiny chip between his dust and the name network and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and private individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant to the Royal Hospital in Hampshire in Winchester Khanty in order to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to the microchip on dogs and cats and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northampi also replaces the number of houses and car locks so that they can be combined with a chip asking for GBP 300 per chapter.
This married one child's father has installed the technology now in both his home and his car in BMW Z4, which will be triggered when he has a hand in the role.
The White House's exhibit cost thousands of taxpayers
According to military documents published in the TIME magazine, the decision by the White House to launch a naval helicopter last month to pay no less than USD 24 000 to taxpayers in the south of an American production event.
The green and white colour Sikorsky VH-3D, which is called the Marine One of the President's cabin, was the focal point of the American building programme demonstration on 17 July in the White House.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and the senior officials of the White House reported on industrial products from all 50 states on their tour.
A helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a yacht from Maine, a fire-fighting car from Wisconsin, and a chainsaw made from Mississippi.
According to the documents of the marine Helicopter Square (HMX-1), the helicopter of the White House was required by a helicopter to be present, or only 36 hours before the Fargo, to the public gallery.
"I wanted you to be aware of this, because it is an unusually high-profile event," said HMX-1 commander the day before the event, to his chief officer, the naval officer, in the field of aviation.
The message was that the helicopter would arrive to the southern yard around 7 a.m. on the morning of 17 July for an event starting from 15 a.m. and would stay there until the afternoon between 18 and 21: 00.
Added to this was the fact that, if the exit from the White House were to be delayed, a second signing was needed due to restrictions on working time.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, and the escort security team remained close to the aircraft throughout the time it was on the ground.
It was not possible to read out from the documents given to the TIME magazine whether the second register was eventually needed or not.
The Hatch Law prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 examined whether the particular event might violate this provision.
"We asked if it was in breach of Hatch's law, and we were told not to violate," wrote the commander.
'You seem to have no choice, 'answered the Deputy Chief Officer.
The White House declared the event "made in America" to be an official event and the Hatch law would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The President supported the efforts of health reform during the debate in the Senate at the time and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in check.
The use of an aircraft known as the Marine One or Air Force for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them for purely photovoltaics is unusual.
In February, when his first campaign event in Florida in Melbourne was marked by a presidential plane, his trumpet came to his attention and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about the way his predecessor used the plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the display of" American made "products from all 50 states, made up of American materials by American workers," said Lindsay, the spokesman for the White House, Lindsay Waltery.
HMX-1 teams often test out in the vicinity of Washington and in the southern yard in order to practice the removal of the US President, the White House, with centimetres.
When Trump held its G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 organised 58 samples of the White House.
According to the official, the flight was counted as the norm for the flight crew of that month's training flight to the "American-made" event.
The escort helicopters were flying at that time for an additional 11 hours of 'non-presidential support missions'.
According to the White House, none of the other exhibits burdened the taxpayer's coffers.
According to the representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in organising the display of a helicopter to the southern yard.
HMX-1 does not keep the President's flight budget documents and the exact costs of the event difficult to identify.
But, according to the Ministry of Defence's hourly prices for the financial year 2017, the VH-3D compensation rate is USD 24 380 per hour of the flight.
The check-up documents indicated the length of the flight from the ground airport of the Navy, Quantco, to Virginia, on both sides, for 30 minutes.
The white House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is well below that amount.
"Calculating taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimated reimbursement rates is very misleading," said Mr Walter.
"These estimated compensatory amounts include personnel, maintenance and many other non-negotiable costs to be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the RAND study in 2015, the Ministry of Defence's compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
The White House's former press officer, Sean Spicer, at that time protected the helicopter from being used at the event.
"The point is to show the things that are made in America this week," says Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security and that there are presumably hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So of course it is right to highlight it. "
It is not clear whether or not Trump met a helicopter during a tour in the southern yard during the event, but he did sit behind the role of the fire brigade.
In the White House, the representatives of Trump Sikorsky turned to the media for fun in the company's products on his personal aircraft.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of their products."
Grit Shaadeiko
In the last area of the World Cup in Daegs in 2011, the Shaadeka was hit, 800 m ran away from the foot, and the stadium was taken away with a canine.
Shortly before that, he had received a jump from scratch in a universe held in China.
At Helsinki in 2012 he was injured in the low-cost, but at the Debt Olympics held in London, he received the 23rd place with 6013 points.
The misfortune continued, however.
After the opening day, the Moscow World Cup in 2013 received the grant of a pop-up injury in Estonia, which had been on the Estonian record.
Two years later, he received the 15th place at the Beijing World Cup and met the Olympic standard, but this, too, was more a disappointment to the athlete.
The most difficult kadai was only passing through Shaadeko last year, when he did not get the result of the distant jump from Amsterdam.
I would just like to put together a proper competition once or for all.
Once, "said Shaadeiko.
The worst was still to come: A month later, his Olympic race was broken at the first barrier, due to the reincarnation in Rio.
Time had to be cut back - can we continue with the seven competitions at all?
Is the two-day effort worth all of this?
She thought long, but found peace.
I was able to think clean
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was a time to heal and to think clean.
'i knew I would not put a bag on it yet, 'said Shaadeko of his own self-cleaning.
I was able to turn the clean page and move on with a new momentum.
According to the coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the carer, but she understood that first and foremost the athlete had to get to know himself.
After all, he was cut down by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
'Grit, however, said that he would not give up and he wanted to prove to himself what he was worth, 'says Mägi.
Now there is some kind of peace in him.
He will be happy to do so.
The winning design came back in May when Shaadeiko set up a new Estonian record of 6280 points in Gothenburg in a series of competitions.
During the high-level competition, he improved his personal top marks by listening to almost one metre (13.89) and ran into a barrier to record time.
At that time, the contestant felt that it was not at all a ceiling of ability, but that it was eliminated by a first hunger contest.
Mägi, who guided him for many years, says that Shaadeiko is a ink-on.
He is ready for the athlete, he is good at training.
If something goes wrong or wrong, he says so immediately.
He knows his own body and trusts his reputation.
That is the starting point.
I cannot say exactly what needs to be done and we will follow it.
Shaadeko has also found a new approach.
'i am not one who maximises training, 'he says and says that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also guarantees a good result.
Close to the baby
Good emotions have also been offered the good luck of the loved ones.
Both her former trainee partner, Maris Mägi, and her sister Grete, have recently become parents and the multi-contestant have received support from new air citizens.
"It's been really interesting," says Shaadeiko.
One alcohol that is equal to "training" in the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is a sui generis wine fan that believes - wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sherard is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the 'very active' wine taste process.
By crawling the glass, turning the wine in the mouth, enjoying it and feeling the follow-up, we put our brain at work to create a taste for the wine.
According to Sheperd, wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but taste arises in the way the wine brain stimulates.
He brings a comparison of how the brain "sees" the colors.
"Taste is not in wine, taste creates wine taste," says Sheperd.
The things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender and even the amount of carbon that man produces.
Shepherd, of course, exhorts that wine is not to be filled with drink.
"More needs to be done," he says.
If you take too big a hip, the system is saturated.
Drinking too much wine can harm the brain rather than benefit - according to a 2004 study, people drinking more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity risk.

Afghan democracy depends on women in politics, says UN
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can represent the people only if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women stand for election to the local councils, three women for election to the vice-president and more than 30% of voters who have recently registered are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of the role of women," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women are fully involved and involved at all stages of the electoral process.
Afghan local councils and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
For its part, the Taliban have threatened an electoral process that coincides with a transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
The strong role played by women in Afghanistan will enhance the success of democracy.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission for Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million voters registered are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything more acute for both large and small.
There is always too little time in common, but the staircases offer a good opportunity to combine being together, game, proximity and load.
And what a comfortable solution - wherever you go in the summer, your living handicrafts are always with you, and you will never cease to remember with your fine headphones, 'Let's do the training now!'
Start with heating - it's very good to have a normal slot or pass the bandwidth.
The Kük is the foundation for staying in the form of feet and ashes - who would then like to take the shape of the sand which has been washed from the waves during the summer?
Mammals have to use fabric instead of children!
Firstly, it is safe and comfortable, the weight grows gradually at the same rate as the training force.
Advanced children can also be developed with quite large amounts of children.
The child is trained for balance, reads repeats and feels free to be high up in the stomach and important.
At the same time, larger children can make themselves felt.
The scope of the movement is determined by the touch of the earth and the straight-up of the hands.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the minibus to hold properly.
The child can read through the recurrence and feel trained.
Plank is an extremely useful exercise but hopelessly boring for the child.
But it's easy to make things fun!
Game-plank: Take a long platinum, which then slip through.
In fact, it is more difficult than usual, but much more fun to do when in the meantime you can give the hand to a friend.
The load can be attached to the plate, the small coat, and you can also walk around in this position.
You can put a minor child in a wooden rain, but this exercise offers fun for all children.
At the same time as the crabs are sandy, the trimmer, the ash and the diarrhea can be used as an infection.
The child falls on his feet in such a way that his or her body weight is equally divided in advance and behind.
Security can be held in hands.
Clear the feet and straight up.
Basic can fly, have fun, balance training and have difficulty.
The life of a small coach is an extravagant, if he gets a little Musi every cross.
An additional burden will be placed on the distribution of feet.
Check that the back is in a neutral position.
The children themselves have a lot of fun to do in a couple and a play.
Piece of work and piece of powder.
Keep the child safe, keep it in a neutral position.
All children's favorite and great fun!
For the parent, however, a really effective whole body training.

Philippines for a trip to the heart of fashion fans worldwide
Homes packed with oil are a summer class, which in recent years has become a welter in its own right, which one of the right summer boxers must wear at ease and which traders, regardless of their modest origin, have been able to boil down to an appropriate price tag.
The bag of beer is probably one of those things that have existed at one time in life and that have not caused much emotion.
It just exists, and if it does not exist, there is nothing broken.
Now, however, the shoulder bags are making a real victory, and their fine designers have changed their fine designs for the summer months for simple, oiled bags.
However, it is not just a beach shop; today it is just as popular as a street holiday and even more courageous women are going to go to office with it.
At this point, however, it is worth making clear whether such a summer story as high as this still sits or whether it is worth pushing a rumble and laptop to a slightly more official sumadan.
However, the wealth of love has made the shoulders of women a true love of summer.
For example, when reading foreign Moeblogists, the first thing that remains to be seen is that the Moegman during his holiday trip is the first thing to produce on the local market and buy a few shoulder bags to which he is always loyal and which accompany his beach, friends and his holiday.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a large pile from the market and sell or give it to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting, however, that the demand for bags among readers is so great that women (and men!) would probably go to each other in the real world to become happy owners of some homes.
In a way, this madness is understandable, because rarely are these arrangements when, in a fashion, it is possible to buy something that has risen to its slow state for only a few euros.
True, clever merchants have also discovered a simple money-making option here and so fine luxury brands are selling their oils for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Obviously, in order to ensure that the richer customers do not have to feel like a butcher, that they are going round with some cheap bags.
For example, you can buy Dolce & Gabbana a beer bag worth over EUR 1 000.
However, the Chafour breweries can be interpreted around €6,000.
However, unlike most fashion buildings, the beer bags do not come from a few large fashion plants, but their story started far away.
Indeed, the tar sands are said to come from far from the Philippines, where they have been carried without a wide range.
Redness of the shoulder is there primarily for the exponent and the local ones very often do not see it going around with them.
It is said that tar sands date back to the 14th century and are pretty much in line with normal replacement.
However, as the shoulder bag does not have to bite as strongly as a basket, the ink and other materials can be swept under them, which make the home more personal and therefore even more effective.
For example, recently there have been particularly trendy bags with coloured drawings or leather straps.
The letter of thanks can be sent primarily to the actor Jane Birkin, of whom the largest sunken beer fan had not been seen before.
It was a beer bag for all kinds of clothes and did not think much of it was going to the Cannes Film Festival.
Not only does it not play a smaller role today when homes are popular, but it is also the case that caring for them is a nonsense and, unlike all kinds of other summands, it is not necessary to take care of them with special means, but also the water and wet towel.
As is the case with trend attacks, after the classic appearance of the brands have been translated by all kinds of interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you can buy a long line from your oil or a tiny bit of beer.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that a classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, although it does not go into a beer garden.
But, what is the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, this kind of beer-packed bag, reminiscent of its style, has been regarded as a classic, open on the ground and short on the shoulders as well as on the sand and the sand.

GMB is concerned about investments in the McVitie's Glasgow factory
The trade union is waiting for confirmation from the managers of McVitie, a cookie producer, of long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow factory.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent on the future of the Toll cross site investment.
More than 500 people work in the factory, which produces a cookie by Hobobs and Rich Tea and other products.
The company's McVitie owner, Pladis, said they have invested in the object over the last few years with over GBP 5 million.
Employees were hired there, and the trade union chairmen "are the first to hear" when something changes in the factory's activities.
In a letter sent to the objective manager of the company, GMB Scotland addressed a request "to address concerns that the facility will not be used to modernise production lines."
GMB's senior manager, Drew Duff, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the head of the object on Toll cross business needs and the investment plan for the future is a matter of deep concern to our Members.
Several generations of families have worked here and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow, as a vital pillar for proper employment in a region with high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, in the eastern part of Glasgow, in terms of jobs, wages and welfare, and in the context of Brexit, rising living costs and the chronic decline in production, there is an urgent need for a thriving productive enterprise in McVitien. "
The representative of the Pladise said: "The objective manager of Toll cross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will respond directly to him as we value active communication with workers and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting took place in Toll cross between workers and GMB representatives, where a number of issues were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested more than GBP 5 million of the Toll cross object, most of it has gone into production lines and to improve operations.
We fully understand Toll cross's heritage as an object of production and if there is to be any change in the object's activities, employees and trade union representatives are the first to hear about it. "
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about Neyman's approach?
La Liga can regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up trying to attract Neyman to his ranks by making an offer of GBP 189 million to buy him. But did they warn against Barcelona three years ago for this record coup?
This moral approach has opened a transitional period in the summer and the Ligue 1 club is ready to crush more than twice the buying-up of the current world record, set up last season by Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United at GBP 89 million.
When the transition is completed, Neyman will become the most expensive player in the world and also the most highly paid professional athlete in the world, starting to earn more than GBP 500 000 a week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona is, of course, angry because of both the approach and the breaking-up of Neyman, although a close source to the Catalan board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since its arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the President of the PSG warn the football world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed an interest in concluding the Blaise Matuiga contract in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi strongly warned all the clubs thinking about recruiting some of the best PSG players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they concern some of our players, we'll meet them and contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But when they try to enter into an agreement with some of our players, they have to face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this border, as the Spanish club showed interest in the PSG central player Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow an Italian to leave under any circumstances, and that Barcelona could have a setback as a result of this interest, losing one of their precious assets in the form of Neyman.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit.
"Brex is seriously threatened by a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," warned the VARADKAR on its first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June.
'i cannot imagine who would benefit, 'he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made possible the current free movement of people and goods, "said VARADKAR.
"This is our vision for the future: Building bridges, not borders," he stressed.
Mr Varadkari said that he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and, failing that, to remain part of the European single market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained by the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, the VARADKAR said: 'Surely we could have one with Britain'.
The alternative would be a return to customs posts declaring historical division and political failure.
"A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit the 'challenge of our generation' and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily life.
The Irish Prime Minister met leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when he visited Belfast.
