Four members of the Kemerovo group detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the Post, police in Spain detained Slava Gulevich, head of the so-called Kemerovo group in the Estonian alliance, known as Slava Kemerovski in the criminal world.
Gulevich, detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects detained in Estonia.
They are suspected to be members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal association between the ages of 27 and 55 who mainly commit drug crimes.
An alleged leader of a criminal association was detained in Miami, the province of Malaga, Spain.
Three men were detained as a suspect in Estonia, one of which is a leading figure in the criminal association, according to the data collected, and two are members of a criminal association.
The data collected indicates that there was a clear division of tasks and roles in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal association's actions was to commit drug crimes and thereby generate criminal proceeds, "commented Vahur Verte, head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case.
"We are not ruling out an increase in the number of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been interested in law enforcement in the past, and some of them have been serving sentences for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues had played an important role throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become normal for us, and this week's operation demonstrates the success of the collaboration," said prosecutor Verte.
Ago leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said the detentions were preceded by a preliminary investigation that lasted nearly a year and a half.
'in the first half of the week long work was realised and at the same time we held suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain, 'he said.
Leis added that Central Criminal Police officers were assisting in detention in Spain.
For years now, we have good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and Civil Guard.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe as well, "said leis.
The information gathered so far makes it clear that men suspected of being at large can continue to commit new crimes, so the prosecutor's office requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain faces his surrender to Estonia.
Real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized as part of this criminal case.
The pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case will be conducted by the Central Criminal Police's Organised Crime Bureau and run by the Public Prosecution Service.
Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of racketeering in 2005 and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, after the then alliance leader Nikolai Tarankov, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the criminal world.
Gulevich, from Kemerovos, rose to prominence in the Estonian alliance in the early 1990s when he began dealing with blackouts in Tallinn.
He reportedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and demanded a monthly roof tax from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscation of proceeds of crime and court rulings that have entered into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest court rulings, the eight defendants separated from the criminal case of the so-called Dikajev criminal association, from which €80,000 in criminal proceeds were confiscated, or the judgment against nine individuals that Igor Aleynikov created in 2006 a criminal association aimed at illegal trade in cigarettes and committing crimes related to human trafficking in East Virumaa and Southern Estonia.
The confiscated criminal proceeds amount to almost EUR 71 500.
In these criminal matters, it has been a success for police officers to exchange information and evidence with their foreign counterparts on a daily basis and, if necessary, in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri about the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement states: "The NAACP travel ban issued for the state of Missouri, valid until 28 August 2017, invites all African-American travelers, visitors and missourians to be particularly attentive and extremely careful as they move around the entire state, given the entire rotation of suspicious racial events that have taken place at this time across the state."
NAACP said the group was urged to issue a travel warning by both the recent Missouri law, which makes it harder to win cases involving discrimination, and the fact that the targets of state law enforcement are unequally largely minorities.
'people's civil rights are being violated.
They are drawn to the roadside because of the color of their skin, they are beaten or killed, "Rod Chapel, president of NAACP's Missouri branch, told The Kansas City Star.
'we've never received complaints so closely before. '
This is the first such warning issued by the organisation about the US state.
The group cited events such as racist insults toward black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black woman from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General showing that cars of black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped in the state than those of white people.
"The note is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and work colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
'people need to be prepared, whether it's about embracing bail money or informing relatives that they're going through the state. '
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime information program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state 16th in the state's cross-section for similar violations.
The travel warning is also in response to Missouri's new law that makes it difficult to sue the company for discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU) had previously issued travel records for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because the ACLU says it increases racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but more recently, interest groups have begun to use this measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about the different forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis or liver inflammation can be caused by five different - A, B, C, D and E hepatitis virus.
All of these viruses provoke acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, the malignant cost is chronic hepatitis B and C, which can continue to develop into liver cirrhosis, or liver corn and liver artery.
Kuulo Kutsar, an epidemiology adviser at the health board, tells us that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bad outbreaks, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and skin and muscle.
The last feature of the disease is also the popular name of liver inflammation.
Hepatitis can run without symptoms in children.
Different types of liver inflammation can only be determined on the basis of laboratory study data.
Acute hepatitis can switch to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without symptoms of the disease, meaning that a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver damage disease.
Kuulo Kutsar points out various forms of hepatitis and describes their progress more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, from an infected person's emissions of hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, getting into their mouths and consuming drugs.
The risk of hepatitis A infection, or risk group, includes family members and carers of sufferers, people suffering from chronic liver disease, people having sex with the infection, men having sex with men, drug users, travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular by recommending vaccination for people who travel a lot and are at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene requirements are important: Wash or disinfect your hands before using food to wash all fruits and vegetables.
Hepatitis B viruses spread in contact with the blood of a sick person, injection of drugs, tattooing, augmentation, use of blood-contaminated household items (toothbrushes, pregnancies), donor blood, sex with a person with hepatitis, and hepatitis disease for more foetal / newborn.
The risk of hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, the newborn, sick family members and carers of an infected mother, health care, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body columns, and passengers visiting countries with a high incidence of hepatitis B.
It is possible to vaccinate people to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, it recommends vaccinating people at risk, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infections, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
The other prevention measures for hepatitis B are: Refraining from using foreign hygiene and manicure tools, other witty tools and systalde-needles, tattooing and augmentation, and using condoms in the event of infectious sex or avoiding sexual risk-taking.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation scheme in Estonia and free for children.
Hepatitis C viruses spread in contact with a sick person's blood, injection of drugs, tattooing, augmentation, use of blood-contaminated household items, donor blood, sex with a person with a hepatitis drug, and hepatitis disease from mother to foetus / newborn.
The risk of hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, the newborn, sick family members and carers of an infected mother, health care, rescue workers and police officers who are exposed to blood and other body columns, people with HIV infections, and passengers visiting countries with a high incidence of hepatitis C.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: Refraining from using foreign hygiene and manicure tools, other witty tools and systalde-needles, tattooing and augmentation, and using condoms in the event of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
D hepatitis is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which multiplies in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
D hepatitis viruses spread on exposure to blood and other body columns, contaminated with systalde-needles, sexually and rarely infected from mother to fetus.
The risk of hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from being infected with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses spread female-orally on the way to drinking water and food, including little heat-treated beef, fish and sea shells, donor blood, commonly used syringes and infected mother to foetus.
Passengers may be infected in countries with a high incidence of hepatitis E.
Measures to prevent hepatitis E include compliance with hygiene requirements: Wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Fruit and vegetables are washed before consumption, avoid eating little heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption.
While competitors tried to print the four-time Olympic champion off the track in the last round, Farah, 34, found strength in the final round and won at 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife Tania and children with him on the track after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
It was wonderful to be on the road with them, 'Farah told journalists.
Farah is aiming for a fifth title contest in London in a row with a golden shower of 5,000 and 10,000 metres.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connori's "Daam in gold. The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimti's masterpiece, the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer," the birth of one of the artworks far deeper into the cultural life of the late 19th century and early 20th century Vienna.
But even more deeply into history.
To the award-winning amount of information, perhaps a harder cut axe, a narrower subject would have allowed the extraordinary story of the portrait promised in the title to gain more influence.
At the moment, there are two books between some of them: Gustav Klimti and his painting "Daam in gold" depicted the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a much more extensive and comprehensive history book about respected Jewish families and the German occupation, with its after-effects in Austria.
The first third of the book leads in the midst of a pulsating Vienna cultural life, and who himself ended up in the Austrian capital can easily imagine how life went around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone turned their heads in the Central Café when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and when you see the name in the book, you feel more like a grammar.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was operating in a city where there was an incurable syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, as if nothing was added to the development of the story.
Or perhaps, though, every odd brush draw adds colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in 10 residents of Vienna was Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice to open with Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and Klimt for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburgs empire.
But Adelet's entire glamorous life she belonged to was not drawn.
If you look at "Daam in gold," it's hard to believe that towards the end of life, this magnificent lady was infected with socialism and dreaming of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1983, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of her husband from Klimmer, the last moment was the hottest painting in Vienna.
The climb order cost 4,000 kronor at the time, a quarter of the price of a country house with a good location.
That, for some portraits, the master's grace with the model was not deterred by the sugar magnate.
As for Adeles, the only certain fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist created during the work continued until the end of life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Daam in gold.
The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait, "Varrak 2016, Aldo Randmaa translated from English.
Just before work began with Adelega, Klimt had visited Ravennas San Vitale basil, and researchers think it was the brilliant mosaics seen there from the Emperor Theodora that gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adelest painted as a mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Daam in gold" in Vienna in 1908 and at about the same time (from 1907-1908) another golden was born in the land of "Snovelty."
For art historians, the similarity between the two women did not go unnoticed.
How is Hitler involved in the story?
"I think to remember my friend Klimt, I am indebted to him to make his hand work available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family's Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had another portrait of Adelest.
Also in her testament (Adele left in February 1925), she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscape painting to the Austrian gallery.
She inherited her jewellery to her sisters Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had graduated from the "Austrian Mona Lisa," 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to get into the Vienna Academy of Kaunite Arts, but failed at the time of the drawing.
While sometimes the reason for Hitler's later anti-Semitism is that Jewish professors didn't accept him into the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in Maria's testament, had changed considerably by 1939 - it had become important to find wonderful works for the Nazi Party from Vienna's rich Jewish art collections.
Hitler's personal art treasure was also matched by some of Adele's work at home, but not those of Klimt.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery began a ten-year litigation between the Austrian government and the heirs of Bloch-Bauers.
At this point, it should be noted that if the "kiss" is seen at Belvedere Castle in Vienna, the "Daam gold" depicting Adele Bloch-Bauer must be seen to travel to New York's Neue Gallery.
And before the Vienna race read through the aforementioned book as well.
Even if you don't plan to go to see Klimt's works, because at least my emotions revolved around more Nazi and Jewish issues after the book closed than the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer sold for $135 million.
So not so much the portrait, but rather the fate of the family - and a very moving story.
The Bauers lineage, which was mentioned at the beginning of the book, greatly facilitated the orientation of the events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In the previous swim, Gold was very close to the personal record of his own 200m semi floating at 2.16.62.
The peak dates back to a 17-year feat a week ago, when the Canadian junior championship was awarded 2.16.58 by Priit Aavik's dating blog.
Gold escaped last, or tenth, to the A final.
In the final, he passed the distance at 2.15.76 and scored a fine seventh place with a new powerful peak.
Of the Estonian record owned by Alina Kendzior (2.15.13), Goldi remained separated by just over half a second.
In Estonia's all-time ranking, Gold rose to third, and his recent personal excellence is Estonia's fifth ever result.
The young hope for the future is still starting 100m, 200m and 400m at the Canadian Adult Championships and 200 m- and 400m in the mix.
Last week saw the Canadian junior championship in Toronto, and Gold made successful starts there too.
He won a silver medal in the 200m release at 2.03.22.
So quickly, that distance was last floated by a spokesman in 2008.
More quickly than Gold ever, only Elina Partyka of Estonia has sneaked this distance.
The spokesman, who lives in Canada, still won a bronze medal in the 100m vacancy with an excellent personal record, and a new Estonian season peak of 58.66.
Kertu ly Alnek, a year older than him, for example, has swung that distance just one hundredth faster.
To a personal peak, he reached a further 100m in sediment by receiving a letter time of 1.03.69 in the opening exchange.
At half the longer distance, he only scored seventh when he faded in the final at 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season rankings at four different distances.
President Trump goes on holiday, critics sharpen their teeth
Vacation time has come - it also means relaxation for US President Donald Trump.
However, as Trump has so far been one of the most vacation days taken out by the president, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president is scheduled to spend a 17-day holiday at an ominous golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president's vacation began yesterday, opponents of Trump have been speaking out on vacation for a week.
They're casting too frequent resting on Trump.
Notably, it is customary for the president to spend weekend time in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey cottages.
Incidentally, Trump isn't the most rested president in his 196 days in office.
George W. Bush, for example, reached that time to be on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama had half as much as Trump, just 21 days.
But Trumpil does tend to forget things quickly.
Counted days after becoming president, Trump said in a broadcast of "60 minutes" that there would be no time left for long vacations during his presidency, as a great deal needs to be done.
She also expressed outrage over Barack Obama's vacation three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending brakes and jungle contours, ISIS journalists are cutting their heads off."
According to White House officials, a 17-day visit to the golf club is not really any relaxation.
Instead, it is officially called a working vacation, during which Trump has no time for reading or other memorial activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for working holidays.
Notably, the air conditioning system is being replaced in the west wing of the White House, and that's why all the staff had to leave it.
The Oval Office and other work spaces of the president are also located in the West wing.
"I don't think any of you would want to be in the western wing in August when there's 38 degrees and no air conditioning," said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue to work during the holiday.
From where President Trump will spend the next 17 days, you'll get an idea of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't stand for public office if you don't tolerate voter criticism
The father of our country knew a lot about adverse media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to start chasing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, upset him.
But he didn't force his critics into silence.
Because, in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of expression could be taken away from us, and in a weird and silent way, we could be led to massacres like sheep."
That brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to struggle to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people expressing their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And earlier in the week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
The governor's official staged the action void and online commentaries cuddled with counter-reactions in the style of "Keda interested?."
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But it does count.
And that matters a great deal when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an amazingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
His approval percentage ranks second highest among the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a thoughtless responsive darkhead.
He has led the state on a firm hand and remained firmly committed to its principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook rather fabulously as the main tool for communicating with his constituents, for example, presenting his fiery head for the first time after chemotherapy.
So the governor's page, which is a public forum with official labelling, managed by staff earning taxpayers' dollars and blocking people visiting is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's behavior, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than modeling.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of internet trolls battling online, spammers, or a nation full of anger.
The Post spoke with several real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that's exactly what they are, pretty people who communicate with their elected leaders. Teacher, company owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not at all rotten.
The pastor cited the Bible in his post, oppressing Hogan's Catholics.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, an attorney from Bowie, Maryland, did not air anger but quite about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed as he had not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in a commentary in The Son's news story.
'also, I don't like the idea that when plenty of people comment on the same subject, some instantly call it a collective effort rather than admit that it's a huge number of concerned citizens. '
What the governor's office called a "targeted spam attack" would presumably be called "public support" by others.
The Facebook era allows messages to be easily matched by simply blocking a critic or deleting negative comment.
It's much cleaner than in the old days when workers had to be sent out to do the same so they could gather newspapers with critical leads and burn them or arrest protesters and force them to stay silent.
But that's exactly what's happening now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for making Facebook and other social media outlets toothless.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have blocked him from the Twitter stream.
One of the first landmark court rulings on the issue was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the chairwoman of the Loudouni County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment to the Constitution when he blocked a voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for using Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that difficult.
At the time of Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar effect as the intern.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled and anonymous letter writers twisted his way of running.
And even then, Washington had to contend with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making decisions in Washington landmark.
According to historical documents picked up as part of an online project to collect letters from George Washington, he buried the Cabinet under petitions that criticized his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't force them to keep quiet.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are the foundation of our country.
And the right leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of home territory at Renaissance Club
Former European chairman Ronan Rafferty is hoping for the comfort of home territory over the next three days as the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place at the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf course.
The Northern Irishman, who was in charge at the Archerfield Links raid in the neighborhood last year ahead of the final round before the downfall of Paul Eales, is fond of the new venue and will fill the role of tournament ambassador instead of the club's founder and chief executive Jerry Sarvadi.
'i saw the Renaissance Club built and now we're seeing the club shine in full glory with this event, 'said Rafferty.
'the players see the track in their best form, it's in a brilliant position.
Jerry has done a great job of building this place.
He is a keen supporter of the golf game and is proud of what he has achieved here.
It makes it possible to present the trail perfectly. "
The Englishman ever looks forward to being able to defend the championship for the first time, although the man has won both European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
'it's going to be a very special feeling, 'said the bearded player in Southport.
'i couldn't defend my Extremadura Op title because it was taken off the race calendar a year after my win.
It's magical to come back into this fabric.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife, Sharon, last year's win was special.
It was a very special time that we will forever carry in our hearts. '
Gary Orr, who joined the Seniors' European tour earlier this year when he got 50, will also return to competition on homeland soil.
It is his first event in Scotland since taking part in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Opens in 2013.
"It's always a little bit more meaningful to play at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.
'you want to perform well, but at the same time you're feeling extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again enormously and shown a fairly decent golf game.
I'm happy with the way things are going so far. '
The trio will be joined on court by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam, and Seniors tour champion Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder cup captain Sam Torrance are two of six Scots in the race, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, and car parking costs £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds go to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesian culinary land
When Bardina Degei prepares dinner, she doesn't use lead.
She even uses pot seldom.
An Indonesian fringe in a wooden bedroom in Enarotal, the capital of Papua province's Paniai regent, places the housewife in the local language of the bathroom, called nota, right in the place of fire.
After half an hour, the coal sludge is taken from the fire and sprinkled with unwashed hands eagerly into the skin.
Degei sits on the mud floor, he has no furniture, and there he also does his daily housework, such as washing the washing with water from a nearby sex.
The toilet role is filled by a bucket in a roofless room.
As she is the youngest of her husband's four wives, she is not destined to take care of any of the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late, however, can be dangerous, most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, and there are still soldiers.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It is a rare glimpse into life in Papua Mountains, a former Dutch colony merged under Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum that sparked controversy, during which just 1026 elderly papers were forced to vote by raising their hands under the eyes of the troops.
The movement, which has blown liberation from Dutch supremacy, is moving its rage quickly against the Jakarta government, which is still keeping the region under its strong control, keeping out foreign journalists and human rights watchers.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed to Papua and West Africa, so the independent Papua New Guinea remained in the east of the island.
Enarotali is both a remote and deserted place. To get here, you have to fly from the provincial capital of Jayapura for 90 minutes to Nabires and then pass a five-hour journey setting nausea with a rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city, with a population of about 19,000, is made up of tree houses surrounded by bamboo fences and cover wavy iron roofs whose rust has turned different shades into yellow brown.
Very few Indonesians have taken the journey here, not to mention journalists, and almost no foreigners have been here.
Prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries, Mee Pago's boats wore a gown called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing clothes like this," Degei says, referring to her colourful hand-coated turbine, dark plum and private skirt.
'before that we carried only plant leaves on the body. '
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are among the worst in Asia.
But it is also an Indonesian culinary country.
Just 100km from Nepal, a mountainous province of around New Jersey with a population of 153 000, Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua can boast consumer timber stocks worth an estimated $78 billion.
But these riches are the source of the suffering of the boats as they result in the suffocating presence of the powerful Indonesian military.
A 2005 study by The New York Times showed that Freeport paid roughly $20 million to local military and military units from 1998 to 2004, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
Papuate's efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and they are mishandled.
Human rights activists say more than 500,000 boats have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killing in Papua tribal mountain lands in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested by Indonesian police in the area.
The 2016 report "We lose everything" by the Archdiocese of Birsbane contains testimony about atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to another report, rape and giving electric shocks are particularly common) and a brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because such incidents are happening every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Screws have been turned down even more strongly as Papua's natural resources have caused an influx of newsettlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the province's 3.5 million residents are Christians, but demographics are changing, with black economic migrants arriving from Indonesia's crowded islands of James, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Chicken bearings sell with chunky chicken and mixed vegetables gado-gado, which is served with peanut levels.
Locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables in a traditional market cheaper than local boats," explains Abeth You, 24, who was born in Paniais, who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital for work.
"Indigenous boats use Papua mama-mama [women] and therefore lose their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is known among the people as Jokowi, pledged in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights abuses in Paapuas.
The former puppet won 27 of the 29 constituencies, including Paniai, on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But Paapuas has changed very little, and locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," You says.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai was at a low point.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang at the Enarotalis section for Christmas when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle from darkness.
The clumsy children told them they should switch on the front lights.
According to the story of the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers insulted their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, drunk soldiers drove children behind and beat them with the handles of their guns.
One of the soldiers then shot among the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, was beaten so brutally that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, a nearby Electoral Commission building was set on fire and things escalated further the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of a local police station and a military command centre to demand justice.
They were wearing ceremonial hunting boots and presented a waita-dance of Papua honey pago tribe, during which they ran around and hiked into a fortress.
Some protesters began locking rocks at police and military personnel.
When the outrage escalated, soldiers were sent an order through an insider. "When the crowd points more than three times the resistance, let them down," according to an official document seen by TIME magazine, but not issued to local media outlets.
Yeremias Kayame (56), a senior in the Kego Koto district of the town of Enarotali, felt the threat and called for peace to be maintained, asking the crowd to go home.
No one had the will to listen.
"Turning around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," she told TIME magazine in her distinctive colours on the veranda of a tree house.
Kayame still doesn't know who was the shooting, but says the month came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"There were a lot of people, plenty of dawn," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to a cousin who witnessed his shooting.
'i ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him, 'said Yohanes, who uses only one name like many indonesians, according to TIME magazine.
'i saw he was dead... I kissed him. '
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only ensured the safety of his district as it was attacked.
'we have to protect ourselves if we're threatened to kill, 'said Pudjo Sulistiyo, Papua police spokesman in 2015.
'it's a matter of life and death. '
Five young protesters were killed and many injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
News of the killings only arrived in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapuras gave an impassioned speech in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and pledged to address the abuses that took place in Paapuas.
"I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never happens again in the future," she said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism for solving crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately, apologies followed, too.
'most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of these took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes, 'he said.
However, speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying he had no intention of setting up a Paapuas mechanism for dealing with complaints.
Instead, he said, "everything will be settled by law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the bloody independence referendum in 1999, said 11 crimes against human rights had already been solved by Paapuas, including Paniais.
The families of the victims in Paniai accepted such claims with gloomy weed.
"I've been interrogated four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," Yohanes said.
'i'm tired. '
She says she still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," she says.
'i'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot. '
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view that people in Paniai are afraid to stage this incident.
He said he was beaten by the army after he had helped bury the four victims.
"After burying the dead bodies, the military came looking for me," she says.
The shootings have not ceased.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai neighborhood of Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when he went to war between villagers and the head of a construction company, who refused to transport the unconscious man to hospital.
This male, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died en route to hospital.
Angry villagers protested at a construction site in front of the company's office.
Police said villagers stoned police officers, on which the latter responded with warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) began firing at the people, killing one person.
"We were in great panic, afraid of retaliation," said Dominggu Badii, 29, of TIME, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured on the sidelines.
'i've been hiding in my house for two days. '
Deiyai's parliament has called for the police officers involved to be held accountable and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of honey, moni, Dani and damali tribes living in Papua's hallowed central mountainous countryside.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL), an army of rebels that it says protects the rights of boats, carrying out attacks and kidnapping raids in case among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the VPL leaders come from the Philippines, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of "protecting the sovereignty of the state" the army has in recent years arrested Paniais and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them will never appear again.
Among the people of Papua, Panias is known as a "tragic forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
The lack of rice sold in Enarotalis is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as inaccessible.
People grow all their food themselves, mainly bathroom, plus a bit of fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can maintain four or five bathrooms.
They usually keep most of the harvest to the family; the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten bathrooms cost only 10,000 Indonesian roupies (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has deepened between submerged boats and new migrants who have arrived in large numbers since the opening of new routes at Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist are going to better educated and wealthier migrants.
The Papuas themselves often lack the capital or the necessary skills to run a competitive business.
"Young people aren't interested in staying in the village because there's no jobs and no money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world out of Papua.
In addition, there are severe restrictions on foreign media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua as "they didn't follow relevant practices" even though they had been given a rare filming permit.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy head of Human Rights Watch's Asia department, Jokowi's election promises to lift restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"Journalists trying to make reports from Papua's most eastern unruly provinces and western France are facing new threats, rejection of visas and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a drilling view of the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific countries, including Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tupain, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands, spurred the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate "a wide range of large-scale crimes" in Paapuas, including the shooting of Paniai.
Those same countries have historically supported the VPL.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "There is still democratic order and freedom of the press in Indonesia, so it would be hard to bury evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take notice.
When the Dutch official delegation, led by the country's human rights envoy, Kees Van bar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people interrupted their silence, according to a source who was present at the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, urging: "We want freedom."
New presidential elections will be held in Indonesia in 2019, but the boats do not believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he's surrounded by people involved in Paniai shooting," says Hobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants to make it clear to Jokow that not only are people in Paniai constantly living under the threat of a predatory army, they are suffering from misery due to nightly education and health services.
Gobai says people in Paniai, like other boats, consider their voice given to Jokow a debt he must pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," she says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims managed another symbolic rebuke and buried the body of one of the victims on land in response to the police station and military base.
Knowing that justice may never be put on their feet, they will at least prevent those responsible from forgetting their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with a lowered head.
'What else could we do? '
Fire swallowed the Dubai Torch skyscraper for the second time
The fire fed through one of the world's highest living standards in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee that 337 meters high and 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that has ravaged a high-hitter in just two years, which happens to be called Torchiks, or Ring Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of the fire was reported.
'we slept and woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "one resident, who called himself George, told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Defense officials said firefighters extinguished the flames at about 4 a.m. local time (0000 GMT) and were yelling at the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for those affected.
This incident could once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on high-rise foreign soil around the world.
The investigation, conducted in the wake of the Torch board fire in 2015, found that the most damage was suffered by fasteners - decorative panels and insulation on the external surface.
UK police have said they believe London Grenfell Tower's isolation and facade panels may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that occurred there in June, which killed around 80 people.
Look: These phones will probably become sales hits in the autumn
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans because then phone manufacturers will unveil their new top models.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came on sale in the spring, with new hitt-phones expected for shoppers in the autumn.
According to Christian Seema, Tele2's marketing and sales director, this year's flagship ships are characterised by an innovative design, eye-popping sketch, servast-edge 4K resolution screen and ultra-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the top of the Estonian smartphone sales ranking, caused great excitement in the tech world.
Autumn allows smartlovers even more fabulous fast charging, a more durable battery, a better quality camera and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that rumours can already make assumptions and predict four top models that are thought to conquer this year's sales rankings.
These four top smartphone models will reach stores later this autumn.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to reach stores as early as mid-September.
Rumours about what the new Apple model looks like, and what can be done with it, are spreading a lot.
While the iPhone 7 hasn't brought significant big differences next to the iPhone 6s-, for Apple's tenth birthday, the new model is expected to be completely different from previous ones.
There has been talk of four colours: Black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, has been lost on the home button and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple's design manager JonyIve insists the new iPhone model looks like a smooth glass.
There has also been talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to the eye-popping sketch, cordless charging and even more quality camera, you can expect a faster A11 processor.
It's certainly one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
The pre-order of the brand new model Galaxy Note 8 begins on August 23.
There have been many rumours of what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like, though.
It is reportedly designed to be even more for the business user and S Pen allows for even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which is a waist and the other a TV item with a narrower field of view.
No one knows yet what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, it is Samsung's first test, certainly comparable to the iPhone 8 in terms of quality.
However, we are looking forward to 23 August.
While Nokia has brought three smartphones on sale this year, led by Nokia 6, there is still a shortage of their flagship - the Nokia 8, which will be presented as early as August 16.
We look forward to a 5.3-inch edge-to-edge screen from Nokia and an ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
For Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminium corps and a significant level of water and dust resistance at IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras with optics manufactured by the company ZEISS.
If Sony's solid flagship has been the XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We expect a smartphone that is slightly more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better cameras.
There has been speculation about Sony's new model that its display is at least monthly.
What the reality brings, we can see very soon, as traditionally Sony has unveiled its autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair IFA, which this year takes place from 1 to 6 September.
According to transcription leaked phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico about paying for border wall
The Washington Post disclosed transcription of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On January 27, Trump went on a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly declaring that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president cracked the wall with him for public condemnation, tweeting: "You must not say that to the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcription of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also published, revealing a tense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take on refugees heading to Australia was' ridiculous', 'nervous' and 'stupid'.
Trump ended his speech by telling Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not consider the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Liins in a case where the city of Tartu rejected their offer for the procurement of bus transport between July 2019 and 2029.
This is an order rejecting the offer of OÜ MRP Linna Liins in Tartu bus hangar because the tender did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Aputin, Head of the Municipal Law Service.
This is the procurement of public bus transport within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP Linna Liins appealed the decision of the Tartu District Court to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court did not take it to process.
While many on social media complain that the fallout from the Weekend Festival is disrupting their night's sleep, and the entire city is full of drunken bracelets, there are many who do not have any bad words to say about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that in the store, the brakes were so polite!
I didn't see any havoc or rude.
Even the kindness I saw, "says the eloquent Laine.
"It's nice, after all, to come, to be, and to enjoy, Perth, which has been left in the winter like a winter dream," he adds cheerfully.
The cumbersome Laine sleep from the beach is not bothered.
While living in the city centre, he still heard that music was being played on the beach, the music has not yet reached his home.
"But I hope I hear," she says cheerfully.
Agnes, who also spoke to the Hill, tells us that the Grand Festival is more of a good one - it makes a significant contribution to the turnover of local merchants.
In addition, he is delighted that so many outsiders have come to visit the summer capital.
The woman is not disturbed by the makeup of the scales.
Even though I am no longer on the beach, it is good that the beach has revived.
And it's great that the nation is moving and that's been the case three times already, "she says.
The first time, I think it was a bit worse.
"Then maybe there were complaints," he ponders.
But the meme on the beach, he says, is common for the summer capitals.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little city," says Harri, who is hiding in the park.
Meme and möll have also not beaten his life rhythm.
But for what?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this communication between nations would be better.
Loud music doesn't muster the man.
It does not mix, even though I live near there.
"Good people can save and there's no trouble," he says.
Guests who came to Perth, he said, are polite.
"With bottles, of course, they're also a bit exaggerated, but young people are young and Lord God - give it a go, but be people and we can do it!" He says.
Coastal residents have traveled somewhere away by then, whether to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this kind of meme," says Tiina, who walked with children in Perth.
His family's sleep does not bother the festival music either, even though last year it went further than this year.
Last summer, the stage was the other way, then we heard more.
We live outside the city ourselves that, in fact, it does quite well on the far side of the city, "he says.
Pearson will cut 3,000 more jobs and reduce dividends to revive business
British education company Pearson said on Friday it would cut 3,000 more jobs and reduce its interim dividends by 72 per cent, thereby launching another restructuring programme to address the threat of business distress.
The jobs to be covered, which will most likely be laid off in late 2018 and early 2019, according to chief executive John Fallon, will add to the 4,000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced plans in May to cut costs by another £300m ($394 million) as part of a third cost reduction program to try to revive a business that has suffered a blow due to a rapid shift to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell a stake in Penguin random House last month to its partner company Bertelsmann, said their expectation in relation to the year had not changed since it reported a 1 per cent increase in sales revenue to £2.3bn in the first half of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, according to officials.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest of acts of violence to hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a Herat mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "man-made self-made explosive."
According to the statement, all are injured in a stable condition and are being treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents say the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) are a serious source of concern for forces in Qarabagh, NATO's Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, roughly 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite cell in Kabul.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bomb attack killed more than 150 people in the city centre - the military attack that led to the most deaths in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops helping the country's military and police.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies and particularly President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA annulled decision to postpone dive warrant after raids
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) overturned the decision to delay the introduction of an Obama-era regulation requiring states to limit emissions that cause smog, one day after 15 states sued the agency because of that move.
The EPA announced the decision to proceed with "operations to determine the 2015 ozone content" late Wednesday, saying it shows the agency's commitment to working with the states.
"We believe we need to engage in dialogue with our state partners and listen to them," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to delay ozone concentrations, which measure dive pollution in different parts of the country to determine where its level should be reduced by about one year to the 2018 occupancy to meet the tougher air quality standard.
15 mostly Democratic states filed a lawsuit with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, saying the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to pull back a number of environmental regulations enacted by former President Barack Obama, and Trump says it is part of a broader plan to boost growth.
But those efforts have sparked mixed reactions among Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the impact of increased pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhalation of air containing ozone "can reduce lung performance and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases" such as asthma.
German pigs can come to a party.
German pigs and cattle may have a feast as heavy rains threaten the harvest of the European Union's second largest wheat producer, Bloomberg writes.
This year, it may be the case that weeks of rainfall before harvest can mean that fruit intended for the bread industry can only be fed to animals.
"The quality of wheat is far worse than the bubble and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 per cent of German wheat can go into animal feed, which is double the normal, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all weather this year.
First, winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, replaced by a heatwave in June.
In July, Germany was hit by rainfall, which has continued in August.
Many eyes are turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five per cent of wheat has been harvested.
Most of the region has not yet started harvesting, according to the local harvest buyer Ceravis.
"These are pretty challenging days," said Frank Deckert, a senior trader at Ceravis from Rendsburg.
Consistency in everything, or the cavernous rocks of Finns interior design
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interior of messy homes because, through large windows, the unparalleled views of the shores of Saimaa reach many (life) rooms.
Every step of the way, the aspiration of our northern neighbours to create both tough and perfect (energy-saving) homes.
The ability of Finns to use wood as construction and finishing materials, furniture and beauty products are worthy of admiration and respect.
Immersive techniques and smart solutions can be found in messy houses by both the builder and (home) designer.
There, it comes out eloquently that the constellation of black, white and grey, when complemented by wood tones and room plants, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be snapped up for another week as the fair runs until 13 August.
Accessories and herb pots suggest that it is often cooked in this kitchen.
The line was drawn to Balticu at this year's Weekend Festival on the night, and Martin Garrix did his best to stay in mind as the last speaker.
The nation was in a real turn during Garrix's performance - singing, huddled, dancing enviably.
When Garrix came to an end, the common mass was dispersed from the beach to the city.
We bring you a gallery with all the images that our photographer tried over three days on the Weekend.
Sure, you're also in some of them, look yourself up!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face the nearest future in the most attractive boxing match up to 66.7 kg weight category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN's office in Los Angeles until Garcia, an unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked to the other end of the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's sultry consideration champion.
After Garcia's unanimous decision resulted in a victory over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters will be included in the top five of the weigh-in.
Garcia extended his right hand and said: 'How are you going, champion?
I wish you good luck. '
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at junction 19 on ESPN.
When the pair popped up for the photos, Lomachenko's Mountain Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between the militants would be "the perfect moderation."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
'i moved up for Broner [to 63.5 kg] but I'm not that big.
I'm 63.5 kg per small.
I want to move down to lightweight.
And he has to move upwards to lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fans have wanted it.
So let's offer them that. '
Lomachenko agreed.
'the world of boxing needs this fight. '
Climas raised the question of whether it should be paid to watch it; it is part of his strategy of letting Lomachenko debut in the 61.2 kg class towards the end of this year to make it possible for next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 novices), who also have an interest in fighting Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell to win the title on September 23.
'looking at this fight could be worthwhile, as fans have wanted that confrontation, 'Garcia said, later saying he was open to fighting on any channel offering the best financial package.
'we're key players.
No other name can attract so much attention.
Whenever they're ready... '
Garcia said he considered Lomachenko "a mighty fighter" and could go to see his Saturday match.
However, Lomachenko was modest in praising Garcia, saying he thought the champion of the three divisions from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted this reprieve."
Garcia said the goal was to show the strength of the blow and then boxing.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension was growing for a test of strength between them.
'it's a fight waiting to be realized.
No other confrontation will generate so much attention and smoke.
I'm more than willing to work for it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: 'I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It's going to be a good fight. '
Which parts of the world will be moved to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Protection Agency (PPA) extended and issued a record number of more than 13,000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, when it was decided to issue a fixed-term residence permit to 6702 foreigners last year, the figure was 4928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis will be carried out by the Ministry of the Interior.
While nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year a decade ago, in recent years, this figure is starting to get close to 2000.
The number of applicants for residence permits soared during the crisis in Ukraine - 1087 people received a term residence permit in 2014, up from 675 a year earlier.
According to the Bureau of Statistics, the number of Ukrainian citizens was the highest in Estonia, with 850 more Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia than they left.
"The Ukrainian community has been great in Estonia all the time, and because of the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural for work and learning opportunities to be sought from a country where the community and many families are already ahead," said Kristin rammus, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry.
In the past and in the past, the number of Ukrainians granted a permanent residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in 10 years, the highest number of fixed-term residence permits have been issued for the latter.
When Ukrainians come here mostly to work, Russian citizens for family migration.
"Given the historic Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the biggest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, migration researcher at the Internal Security Academy.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have received an Estonian residence permit have moved to, there is immediately East Virumaa after Harjumaa," he added, and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit was reduced.
"The hype is because, instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been requested for permanent residence in Estonia," explained a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, rampant, who said Russian citizens' interest in the Estonian residence permit had remained rather stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit from last year.
Its aim is to encourage the survival of the people who have adapted.
However, a long-term resident residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has also apparently been reduced because of the new residence permit.
For example, such a residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians will be able to change jobs, and the Estonian state will no longer turn a blind eye to whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit became popular on the hook - the applicants were the holders of the grey passport, the Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 people received a residence permit to settle in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and as many Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of applicants is already 1269.
In 10 years, Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for an Estonian residence permit.
While three residence permits were issued for Nigerians in 2007, there were 200.
It is coming from Nigeria to study at universities here.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular with Georgians, Chinese and Turkish, for example.
The number of Indian, Bangladeshi and Nigerian nationals has risen largely thanks to learning games.
They, too, are subject to the rule that where the community has come up, there will be others more easily, "added the rampant.
In 10 years, two people have moved to Estonia from North Korea, for example, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
While around 6,000 third-country nationals receive residence permits per year, this is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if you think of the citizens of the European Union, migration remains about a percentage, "Maasing commented that the figures are actually small.
In total, 14,822 people migrated to Estonia, according to the Bureau of Statistics.
That means immigration surpassed the second year of emigration.
Most of those moving in and out are Estonian citizens, but more are among those leaving.
As a result, the migration of Estonian citizens was at a disadvantage with 2,000 people.
Estonians migrate, in particular, between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess fashion thrives with sausages, ponds and tweets
However, there is a history of bottomless ideas for Maria Tammevalu - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream somewhere in the museum for hours and admire old sleeves and crabs.
If you do something with a guy, you study and learn more about it every day.
It is a joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of mammu Couture may seem alien to some, but the designer doesn't think so.
You yourself decide how much brilliance is in your life!
I have a girlfriend who has a whole sauna full of haute couture dresses I created.
Because it's not her fault that she doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go on a red whim every day, she also wants to wear those most beautiful dress, and that's what she's wearing!
You can live your own life special!
The fashion artist doesn't recognise the divide between bright events and grey everyday.
It was this reasoning that led to a plan to bring high fashion to rural areas in Estonia, between forests and fields, to people who often do not get to fashion.
The mammal collection was presented, for example, in Võrus, Jõhvi, and in the fashion alley, where a royal defillet with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, the pot is often taken in, nodded with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere - cry braavo, stand up, want to thank you.
Much of the audience came just as curious, but now they're fans of mammu Couture.
If you exceed people's expectations, they're thrilled!
And I like that feeling of being like a summer tour with my mom.
We had a 50 metre red carpet in Perth, a whole street full of beautiful dress, it seemed like they were not coming to an end!
Maria also does not recognise the fashion practice that creation must be presented to a supersale supermodel; she willingly brings ordinary women on stage.
Often I invite my own clients to the stage - they have always been happy to come.
After all, it's such a fabulous experience, you can shine on stage in a wonderful queen!
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen my show, I am always behind the stage to give the last muscle to things as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve would not allow me to watch calmly from the floor.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who not only wants to play a representative role, but to be in everything.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection I exercise myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, you discover.
I am never far from my creation and I am not afraid of work.
The design is not limited to stylistics, logistics, organizing, organizing - everything has to fit into one temperamental woman's day.
These hours of work will still be enormous for fanatics.
I can't tell when my workday ends, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I'm still very lucky - it's like a relentless chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, man gets something beautiful and more compliments.
It has been said many times that there is magic in my dress - they make me feel like a prince.
The abundant disgusted clay lines that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained a mammy Couture signal to this day.
Martin Mürsepp of U18 boys: The weapon of the Estonian subway tournament was now turned against us
Sorry, the fairy tale came to an end.
The first thing that stood out was that we couldn't get our table.
And if there's such a big difference coming in on the table, there's nothing to do, "commented Martin Mürsepp, assistant coach of the Estonian U18 basketball boys 61: 75 for Britain, our only basketball player who played in the NBAs.
Opponents took 28 balls from the assault and suffered so many more attacks as a result.
We also weren't prepared for their aggressive defense or attack, it created.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build protection.
In defence, however, they were able to hold hands everywhere, we could not combine.
That set up the team's feet from the bottom.
Opponents' homework was better done.
Mürsepa estimates that Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes to take down the momentum of its opponents.
In the last quarter - we had zero errors, but the opponents have already had several quick baskets.
Athleticism and tight insistence, which was our weapon in the subway tournament, now all turned against us.
Today, we had no force against their aggressiveness.
The tenant was satisfied with his caretaker in Kalev, Matthias cup.
In the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team; to this day there was a single scoring rush.
It is a pity that such an aggressive opponent had not been met before.
The cup has been confident all along and played his way out today, but it felt like he was tired - he's carried a pretty big burden.
But he made some pretty beautiful moves I've seen before in the trenches, "the supervisor added.
Terrifying numbers: The Neighbours basketball team scored fewer than 10 points in three quarters at the EMA tournament...
The U18 age class doesn't just go to the young men's EMI B division basketball tournament in Tallinn, the nephews started in Dublin the day before.
And, unfortunately, the Estonian game with Poland was in the realm of antirecords.
Estonia lost 25: 65, but still after the third wicket, the position was 9: 49, or only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took their foot off the gas pedal, and that period remained at 16: 16.
In both the first and second quarter, Estonia scored 4 points in the third...
At the beginning, the Estonians caught two pieces from the first four shots in two minutes, and then 25 pieces from the game, then one triple in, and then 21 more shots along...
Perhaps in almost half an hour, one of the 47 shots was caught.
In addition, 2 points came from four free throws.
There was a reasonable number of requests in that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland scored 33 and Estonia had 13 percent (68 / 9).
Estonia has started with two losses, with Portugal's 83: 56 to admit on the opening day.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to replenish stocks
Today, NATO's 1st permanent mine group arrived in Tallinn for the weekend for a planned port visit to replenish stockpiles of ships and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships are preparing to return to the sea, giving crew members the opportunity for a couple of days' holiday.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a series of exercises and be ready for future operations to search for historic explosives.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the training carried out by them in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with allied forces," said Arto Reinmaa, commander of the operation and planning district, which is in charge of the Navy fleet chief.
From June 29, NATO will lead the 1st permanent mine group, Latvian Navy Captain Lieutenant Gvido Laudups, who took over the duties of the group commander from Estonian naval officer Captain Lieutenant Johan-Elias Seljamaa during a ceremony in Riga.
The group's flagship is designated LVNS Virsaitis, a Latvian naval support ship, which also operates the group's flagship stadium.
During this semester, the Estonian Navy mine hunter Sakala is also part of the international unit.
As one of four groups of ships under NATO's naval command, NATO's 1st permanent mine group is a readiness unit among primary rapid responders, which can be sent to various parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, called to life by maestro Eri Klass 13 years ago, will be held.
This year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to the artistic head of the Tallinn Philharmonic, Risto Joost (36).
Risto Joost: To listeners, the Oval World classics include "Traviata" and "Tosca," ballroom answers from the fascinating "Bolerod" amusing "Karlsson" and there is also no shortage of a plan for self-production, which is this time Joseph Haydn's marvellous oratorium "of the same year.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatrical performances.
It's bigger than any music theatre in its usual form.
It is a festival whose fascination takes hold and never quite unravel again.
Because the experience that a listener gets in this sublime and mysterious environment makes human souls sound and touches human beings in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic head of Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't the maestro Eri Klass shoes seem a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it has been very helpful.
He guided me through my entire student career and also supported a diversion career at the start.
Perhaps it is because of this that I find it easier to continue his work.
Different Klas has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it all spills over to me as well.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things are going.
It was the great heart of Eri Klass who gave me the strength to thrive with Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am now and I can do it!
What might excite audiences at this year's festival, the special you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, as a surprise, the first ballet, written on Astrid Lindgren's narrative, will be presented.
It is' Karlsson flies'.
And one notorious nuisance at this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write this piece.
He probably has the character of Karlsson, who has lived in his soul since he was a child.
Risto, how do you cool it all?
Thanks to my supportive partner, for sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I am fortunate to have it.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions are not so dependent on other people as far as I am concerned, in other words, how I go against every new day.
And keeping that conscious tone, keeping positive and actually smiling to myself in the mirror in the morning, significantly increased my lucky percentage.
Especially now this week, with the most important samples, I have been particularly keen to practice it and it works.
Smiling to yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It is not just a catchphrase.
I think that people do not yet know the things of their bodies that the universe offers them, but everyone is slowly discovering it.
Right now, there is an important moment to come.
Do you have some kind of ritual before you enter the conductor's pulse?
It is still, clothes need to be exchanged for more comfortable ones.
It's that little moment for yourself.
But, in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest before a big performance or do a little stunt.
In fact, I even like to actively engage with people, even before you enter the dirigendipult.
But come all to Birgitta Festival, here's what to discover for the not-so-great opera and ballet friend!
Watch the hilarious video with Risto Joseph!
New results of age assessment tests for Swedish asylum applicants published
In Sweden, a test was carried out among asylum seekers, which assessed their age with a novel approach medically. The most recent results of the test show that more than 80 per cent of them were rated older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rkahtsmedicinalverket) began tests earlier this year.
The tests were created for a more accurate assessment of age during asylum applications after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly underage refugees.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases for testing and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2481 test results between mid-March 2017 and July 31.
Eighty per cent (2002) were estimated to be 18 years old or older and in 25 other cases, the Institute of Judiciary Medicine estimated that the test "may be 18 years old or older."
The 432 cases concluded that the person is "thought to be younger than 18."
Tests are used only when a person's age is in question.
Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, said the results were consistent compared to those in previous months.
"We don't see much difference compared to statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The institute issued 581 test results in May and said 442 cases "have indications that the person examined is 18 years old or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of these 581 tests, it emerged that in 243 cases, a person had directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, which makes X-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRT of knee joints, after which they are allowed to be analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some quarters.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose duties include assessing human biological maturity to find out if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
'i've had reason to think about it and I don't think the measurement method currently used should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't make a face that we can, "he told Metro.
But Johan Göransson from the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of dissolving a child inaccurately into adulthood is low.
The highest, at about 10%, is the risk if a person is a little under 18. '

Anna Maria Orel, a 20-year-old copper, made a fine debut at the London Mall, getting a fine 18th with a 737s.
The organ was MM's youngest female cops, and a cheerful woman confirmed she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I got a good experience.
With the first test (72.80), I did my average result straight away, the second (62.80) I risked too much and the third (7337) I was able to keep my head clear, "Orel said after the contest.
I was looking for my emissions and I'm very glad I found it.
Anna Maria Oreli's MM debut ended with a fine 18th.
The rainfall did not bother the organ because, after all, it is training through the winter at the TTC Stadium.
"I'm scared," he said with a small mug.
There was almost a full house section of the nation at London's Olympic Stadium, was Orel tapping people around him or able to turn off?
I did, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it will add up - that's it!
If you compete yourself, you can experience it.
Organ confirmed he would be satisfied with MM's debut, and he still faces a lot of good races: "I came here with this season's 32nd, the last result, I finished 18th.
It is a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and at the Met - that's the only thing that matters.
I take a good experience and some days I want to compete for medals already.
West Virgina governor announced party exchange
West Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday evening at a gathering with President Trump that he was changing parties.
"Like it or not, but the Democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
'Today I'm telling you, having prayed and thought for plenty... today I'm telling you, the Western virgin, that I can't help you any more as a Democratic governor. '
At the gathering, the tribes of joy were unleashed.
"So I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
'as a coach, I'd tell you it's time to play another game. '
Trump had previously promised a major announcement at a gathering in West Virginia.
Trump won by 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the state's only billionaire, according to Forbes, turned out to be elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and the coal business quite him from his father.
It has a value of approximately $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) released an announcement Thursday night that "Governor Justice's party exchange is another blow to the Democratic Party that would rather prevent the country from getting better again than working for it."
"Just 15 governorships and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is just the most recent mention of a party that has been guided from end to end and cannot find a positive and unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
It is perhaps no surprise that there are a lot of people, there are many injured.
Urmet, who is in charge in the medical tent on Weekend, told her yesterday that the patches had had to be shared out quite a lot.
Flashes and berries are basic, except for twisting and light falls.
Also, of course, the head, back and legs.
Uror says visitors come to the festival with the wrong footwear, and so the problems come.
Medics have also had to assist visitors with a couple of major injuries - there have been some panic attacks as well as one leg fracture.
We have also made stitches when a person has broken a hand or finger.
The smaller seams we do here, the bigger ones we send to the hospital.
Watch the video if the festive medics ask for a painkiller to treat the poppy.
Coe praised honest apology from Russians over doping scandal
Athletics international rhino Sebastian Coe praised "Russia's honest apology Thursday" for the doping scandal, according to his words, but reiterated that this is not the time to allow the country back into the sport.
Russian athletics rhino Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAAFs Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his ban on the country was right and had a firm goal of combating doping.
He apologised to "all athletics who have been snapped off gold and silver medals in the competition."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to scrap the ban on competition, which was introduced in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF president Coe told journalists.
'the whole council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian subway also admitted itself that they've had quite difficult times and they're doing everything possible to restructure the alliance. '
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted criteria for its own predicament.
"I believe it was a very constructive day today and there is progress, but Congress supports the working group's suggestion that this is not the right time to take Russia back," Coe said.
'we've got to do everything we can in the next few months to normalise the situation.
We've always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from a broken system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletics who meet strict criteria for the IAAF will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAFs working group, said Monday that Russia does not yet meet several criteria for forecasting.
Following a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that doping controls were still insufficient and that coaches who were banned were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution is dramatically changing the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Little about the electric car revolution dramatically changing everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants such as Glencore can say that from one place they will win and lose from another, smaller mining companies won't help.
Glencore currently serves from coal and oil, but in the era of electric cars, cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel demand will grow.
This year, the governments of the UK, France and Norway have raised the stakes on the spread of electric cars, promising to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
Sestap has already informed Volvo that they plan to abandon the internal combustion engine, and Tesla will bring a cheaper Model 3 electric car on the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that electric cars will be sold more than cars using fuels produced from oil for two decades.
"In terms of some metals, it changes everything," Simona Gambranini, a raw materials analyst at Capital Economics, told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, where demand has been growing for years.
Electric cars have about three times more copper than conventional cars, according to Glencore.
More cops are needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribasi estimates it will increase copper demand by around five per cent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will benefit from a growing trend of electric cars from copper price increases and from being the world's biggest cobalt producer, Jefferies Group predicted.
Its brokerage firm estimates that Freeport-McMosan and First Quantum Minerals are the other winners of the electric car race.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, 70 per cent of cobalt has climbed on the London metal slide.
Last year's price increase was 37 per cent.
Copper has also climbed 14 per cent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Shares in Glencore rose 20 per cent in London, having surpassed rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo America from price increases.
On the losers "side are lead companies like Recyclex and Campine, who need to adjust to a new era.
The main end use of lead is batteries supplying starters of cars with petrol and diesel engines.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found to be another purpose that could overcome a drop in demand," said Michael Widmer, head of analysis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch's metal market.
In the form of lead price movements, there is still no indication of the impact of the unfolding trend.
Lead has climbed 17 per cent this year, with the best metal from price rises among the main industrial metals in London.
Investors will only see the problems for the metal in the far future.
"I'm not sure it's so bad for lead because cheap oil keeps conventional cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at metal broker Triland Metals.
When lead demand falls, it happens slowly.
Maybe it's going to happen that way in about a decade.
Meanwhile, tougher emissions standards mean there is a growing demand for hybrids, which depend on advanced lead-based batteries at frequent engine launches, the international lead and zinc research organization estimates.
Light metals like aluminum replace steel as a lighter car can travel further with less electricity.
This explains the additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes between 2013 and 2016.
It accounts for 2.7 percent of aluminium's total world production.
That trend is likely to get worse, Widmer said.
Aluminium has climbed 13 per cent this year as rising demand from automakers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce mammoth car chains.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steele Europe are also trying to develop a lighter melting of steel to withstand the lower minimum.
"Extremely strong steel should be the answer to this development," said Sylvain Brunet, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
We can see some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil era can also bring suffering to platinum.
It took about half that precious metal into catalysts for cars with diesel engines, according to metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"Many now high-demand commodities such as oil and platinum may not have much demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, a commodity analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole are becoming less important, but they are becoming more important in 15 years.
Platinum producers believe the continued demand for diesel hybrids.
Marc Grynberg, of Uncore, said more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025.
The great hope of platinum manufacturers in the 10-year term is Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos developed hydrogen element based cars that rely on platinum to generate electricity from hydrogen.
So far, however, the technology has not yet commercially justified itself.
"Diesel seems to have a clear loser on the way to electric cars," said Exane BNP Paribasist Brunet.
German automakers suffered a major setback in July as a Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in the hometown of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football finance rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
Rules designed to prevent unbridled spending by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's world-record move from Spanish football club Barcelona to French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that rules the European game and has the power to ban teams from taking part in the prestigious Champions League tournament, are still waiting for Paris Saint-Germai.
UEFA's fair play financial rules (FFP) introduced in 2011 mean PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar's transfer was funded without huge losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar's salary is set to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to the French club.
PSG will no doubt be able to go out with that kind of money to recruit Neymar and add to their star squad, given that the team is funded by the ruling family of Qatar's energy squad.
Clubs are allowed to spend plenty to recruit players, but they have to balance that with legal sources of income that allow them to come up with those in the football business.
The FFP was set up by Michel Platini after being elected as UEFA president in 2007.
This former French player believed clubs falling into huge debt in search of success would actually engage in cheating and risk ruining if banks or owners had to give up support.
Since 2011, FFP will focus on tracking those losses instead of clubs' debts.
This change means that the business model first used by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then making big spending to improve the team and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
During the current three-year evaluation period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can carry losses of up to €30 million.
And despite Platini being shamed out of the presidential office in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"FFP is definitely not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules in the future," Andrea Traverso, who is an FFP catcher at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
While PSG paid for Neymar's overpurchase clause as one complete payout, they will be able to distribute this amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, making it possible to show a transfer fee over the next five years as a sum of £44.4 million per year.
For the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with Manchester City, owned by Abu Dhabi, suffered the most severe penalties in the neck.
PSG were fined €60 million ($82 million at this point), later reduced to €20 million, and the club were required to restrict the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-15 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA are looking for clubs who may try to bowl over regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their incomes through companies linked to the club's owners.
The Qatari company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to count as an official income.
That's what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority's PSG support was upbeat.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymar's PSG service could come from Katari through payments from the 2022 World Cup organising committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny Neymar could become a World Cup ambassador, and argue that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean UEFA will be even more vigilant about any attempts to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not proactively discussed Neymar's transfer with PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that their anonymity is guaranteed as they are not allowed to discuss the situation at PSG.
The most recent reports show PSG made a profit of more than €10 million in the 2015-16 season at a turnover of around €542.4 million.
Data from the last financial year has not yet been released.
PSG hope Neymar's arrival will have a good effect on sponsorship deals, trade and scoring.
The club expects at least a 30 per cent increase in turnover in connection with the signing of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, sought to block Neymar's transition, claiming PSG were thus violating FFP.
'it's a clear case of 'financial doping' with club and country, 'La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, pointing out that PSG are mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal's Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's stance that the country is funding the club.
'it's a consequence of property rights and it's completely changed the whole football landscape over the past 15 years, 'Wenger said on Thursday.
'If the club belongs to the country, anything is possible.
It's very hard to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the country may have other ways or other interests for such a great player to represent the country. '
Norway's low-cost airline Norwegian has a nice tradition of putting pictures of those who have mocked the boundaries in their own field and have been an inspiration to others, writes trip.ee
Along with the expansion of Norwegian's operating geography, the circle of people who have earned a place on the plane has also expanded.
The selected perks include Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (pictured) and Miguel de Cervantes.
In the near future, however, one of the planes will be decorated with a portrait of Queen's legendary singer Freddie Mercury.
50 years ago today: A hurricane storm in Estonia that ripped roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane, called the storm of the century, which raged on 6 and 7 August, caused major damage, particularly to the West Country, Khartoum and Rapture.
In north-west Estonia, wind speeds of more than 30 m / s during those days.
My old man ran from one tree to another in the garden and covered with his hands to support them.
Everything was dark and rugby, like the world stage.
In 2002, my grandmother, Linda Kurova, recalled in an interview with Estonian Nature magazine from Haapsalu.
Linda's husband saw her own planted garden collapsed.
But what do you still support the trees with your hands, where do you get against such a storm?
The sea came under the window, water sprayed from the windows, "Ms Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu, said at the time.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of a railway station perron had flown 20 to 30 metres away, Linda saw the likes of most sharks only the next morning.
According to locals, the trees behind Paralepa were on the ground in Hope, some completely tall, some pop.
Everything looked very depressing, with the storm going through the beautiful old trees with ragina and praginia like war.
West Virumaa was not particularly badly affected by the August 1967 storm compared to Western Estonia, but the losses were great there, the Virumaa Journal wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Lossipark and Padise Park were swept from the ground, but our parks were also badly damaged.
In Tallinn, wind speeds were measured at up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
In Merifield, Tallinn, on the evening of 6 August, a tiny plikatirts had shouted: "Mother, mother!
Chickens are in the air and can't get down anymore! "" The Virumaa Journal wrote.
The Põlli mansion building in Vilnius was destroyed during the storm so it was decided to be demolished later.
The structures of the Türi ski hill, which was later no longer restored, did not withstand Augustitorm.
The Red Test newspaper wrote on August 12, 1967, that clearing cities and settlements of makeshift trees and their branches is progressing slowly, and residents could be involved in clean-up work.
Fertility fields were also badly damaged in the storm, and the newspaper reported that "party primary organisations must be the instigators and directors of both maintenance and grain clearance."
You can talk about hurricanes when the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m / s.
The record-breaking wind record in Estonia persists from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul measured wind speeds of 48 m / s.
A sword erupted on the island of Vaindloo, so the speed of the strong winds measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret to clean bathing areas: Night cleaning work and poor beach weather
Colder summer weather also means less cleaning effort in Tallinn bathing areas.
"If there is weather, there are people on the beach, and if not, there are no people," the beach clerk says.
On the Stroom beach in northern Tallinn, kayaks are crawling.
They are offered melodic competition on low turns by a bumpy tractor ploughing down the stripes on the plate.
In fact, the latter screens through the sand at a depth of seven centimetres, picking out sea cracks and a cross left behind by humans: Bottle pipes, cigarette cones and more.
People still come to the beach, regardless of whether or not the water is warm.
If there's beautiful weather, there's people on the beach, and if there aren't, there are no people, "says Alexander Usov, head of cleaning works at the beach at Haabersti Haldus.
It's 6.30am and there's a bitter cleaning work going on at the beach because at eight, the site has to be fine for people.
Usov is on the job as early as 4 a.m.
Apart from Stroom, he keeps an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakuhile and Paljasaare on the Long Island beach.
There has been a reduction in the amount of landfill.
Years ago, it was much more.
People can now already appreciate what is being done for them, "says Usov, who has been clearing the beast for 15 years.
It used to be that when something new was put up, it was already broken the next day.
Now, what's on the beach is already being held.
The cost of a clean beach
One of the largest works on Estonian beaches is the harvesting of sea debris, or adru, swamped on the shore.
On the Pirita beach, for example, it has to be shipped 400,000 tonnes over the beach season.
"It's an incredible amount," Usov notes.
Another large category is household rubbish, which is all that people leave behind.
The eighteen-kilometre Stroom beach bar has eight large trash containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
There is so much rubbish.
Still, colder summer weather has meant that rubbish is a fifth less than otherwise.
The third type is made up of abandoned belongings.
For the most part, these are children's lives.
As such, Usov has scooped up dozens of mudslides from inside the sand.
They are left waiting for owners on the wooden path leading to the beach.
"They usually come out more, but it is a normal harvest." Usov already knows that he will soon find them again in the sand.
Kids come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
Rubbish is being dispersed
Erika Scholler, a representative for administrative services at Haaberst, concedes that tractor screening work is upsetting locals.
The noise, which lasts from night to early morning, interferes with the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
On the day, however, this work is impossible.
In one month the beach must be screened twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," Scholler notes.
But the goal, like Pirita, Pikakari and Peru, is to get the Stroom beach under the international Siniflag quality mark.
"Compared to Europe, there is a lot more work in Estonia for beaches to be maintained," says Scholler.
We have more adru and stones and harder to screen the sand.
However, there is less rubbish on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Hearing talk of rubbish on the beach, Martin, who lives near Stroom beach, unforced into the conversation circle of journalist and clerks, highlighting the beach's current bottlenecks.
In the mornings, there's a balcony picture everywhere.
The problem is with birds and bottle slaves who have pulled garbage bags on the pavement, "Martin reports.
While it's hard to expect people to be able to change their current behavioural habits, Martin hopes the city government will do something about the rubbish and put the lid on them, for example, to prevent at least birds from briefing there.
Overall, though, Martin is pleased with the development of the Stroom beach.
You can see the city taking care of it.
With children's squares, enlightened and newly asphalt roads, it has become more appealing.
It was once the case that the rolls could only travel one way, "Martin notes.
Aardehunter findings in Stroom: Coins, only coins
The morning slot period has come to take advantage of 40-year-old Dimitri, who, as a treasure hunter, is combing the coastline with a metal detector.
He doesn't think he'll find anything precious today or in the future.
Marine gods are not generous enough to do so.
"I've dealt with it for a year and haven't found anything valuable so far," Dmitri reports.
As a hobbit village, Dmitry's treasure bag has some euro coins, bottle pipes as well as dangerous pounds that will later throw in the bin.
Usually there are still coins.
"There is usually no gold, fingers and so on," says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the former level as powerless growth and inflation easing have softened speculation over the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth remains sluggish as household squeeze incomes have put interest rates on hold.
Policymakers at the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6: 2 to keep rates at 0.25% and fewer members are calling for a rise this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and its 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes will remain as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in the autumn.
However, the bank also signalled that rates growth is needed to curb Brexit-driven inflation over the next few years and a higher than expected rise in borrowing costs may be needed in financial markets.
Members also voted for the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package to boost the economy, which was launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
The bank will end a fixed-term funding scheme that offers cheap funding to banks in February, though it said it was now expected to offer £15bn more under the scheme, which is £115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future as the plight of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption."
On rates, it was reiterated that there was a need for "some tightening of monetary policy" to ease inflation, and on a "somewhat larger" scale than expected in the markets.
The exchange is currently forecasting a first rise in the third quarter of next year and a second increase in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any jumps would be gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and next are comparable to those for May at 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for a 1.8-percent increase in 2018 remained.
Following this news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened rising hopes of a rise, with GDP rising by 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
The bank says growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is starting to gather some momentum at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to cheer on households suffering from rising inflation and wretched pay rises, saying the situation would get a little worse before improving.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent a hit on incomes over the next few years, but a marked recovery in wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The weak pound also boosts the economy by increasing demand for British produce, which partially offset lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were moved to 0.25% last August following a shocking EU referendum that caused a sudden weakening of the pound.
The bank estimates it will probably take four years to fully breathe life into prices and the economy.
Ahead of the bank's latest decision, growing demand for rate increases was felt as inflation had increased pressure on hard-pressed households; in July, three policymakers called for the rate to be raised to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, down from 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected and there will be a rise in the coming months.
The bank said excess growth compared to the 2 per cent target was entirely due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of mortgage brokers at Coreco, said: "Given the recent decline in exchange rates, it seems the mortgage market is becoming increasingly competitive again as lenders yearn for work and hope to end the year positively.
The exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current deals are coming to an end as refinancing, often without a service fee and at a low rate, has become increasingly popular. "
The NHS is prescribing HIV medication that caused controversy for 10,000 people
Patients have access to "transformative" HIV preventive treatment since September following a battle in the High Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England reported that national health care is now making it available to an estimated 10,000 people during the original three-year clinical trial for pre-exposure prophylactic (PrEP) - a tablet that is administered before intercourse and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection in high-risk people by around 86%.
The NHS agreed to fund a clinical trial after an appeals court upheld a High Court ruling last year that the NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite the agency's own claims that the drug should be funded by local authorities instead.
NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens welcomed this move unveiled on Thursday as "a new large-scale intervention," while the National AIDS Fund (Nat) described it as a "pivotal moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start registering people.
Pre-exposure prophylactic (PrEP) is a cell of HIV drugs taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are sufficient amounts of certain drugs in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or no later than two hours before the interval.
Candidates eligible for treatment include homosexual or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment.
Clinics identify fit people willing to participate in clinical coverage, including men, women, transgender people and those whose partner with HIV does not receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a physician there will also be able to register their wish to participate in a local sexual health clinic in the programme.
The programme will cost £10m and NHS England signed a contract to receive the drugs this week after international procurement procedures.
The clinical trial is designed to assess the real potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of who the drug is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Mr Stevens said: "This new large-scale intervention should complement and amplify the widespread and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of fighting one of humanity's greatest health problems. "
Deborah Gold, chief executive of NAT, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted to those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to change England's HIV epidemic.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England, through this clinical trial funded by the NHS, have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The priority now is to ensure that a clinical trial across the country is quickly set in motion and that none of those at risk of HIV are excluded.
Now that PrEP's clinical trial drug has been obtained, we are on our way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of being infected with HIV.
Public Health Shadow Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of a clinical trial at PrEP is very welcome and well overdue after months of delays and spitting the government's feet.
Evidence shows how much change this drug can bring to HIV prevention work and stopping the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial brings us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it's important that the clinical trial is introduced across the country as soon as possible to protect people with exposure to HIV and bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society. "
The price of electricity rose by 12% in Estonia, while Latvia and Lithuania fell.
In July, the difference in the share price for the next day of electricity between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to 1.94 euros, compared with €7.71 in June this year, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price difference is the riches between Lithuania and Sweden.
In Estonia, the average stock price for electricity was 34.33 euros per megawatt hour last month and the price rose 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to €36.27 per megawatt hour.
In Finland, the price was €34.17 and the electricity exchange Nord Pool system price was €26.37 per megawatt hour.
Prices rose 12 and seven percent respectively.
Electricity between Estonia and Finland moved from 75% of the hours last month to Estonia and 16% of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
There were no deals for the next day in the remaining nine per cent of the hours between the two countries.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Latvia in 99% of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73% of the hours had all transmission capacity.
According to transactions on the Nasdaq OMX market on the last trading day of July, the stock price for electricity in August could be around 34 and 37 euros per megawatt hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting electricity production prices soared last month, and transactions took place at a cost of €5.04-5.47 per tonne.
Living the high life - a half-floor and smart design apps have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a square home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator, changed her major Knightsbridge home against Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne hasn't packed up her bags and sold the apartment on is a tribute to the new design.
'before that, I lived on a much larger surface with my former partner in Knightsbridge, 'said Joanne.
'i was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offer.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer on the same day. '
Since the first visit, this 93-square metre apartment has undergone a complete overhaul.
At first it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half-floor to take advantage of high ceilings.
'i wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands, "she said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed in Notting Hill to take advantage of 3.8 m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces on top of each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a half-floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach the thing creatively.
"Metal construction is quite complex," he explains.
'we had to restructure the rooms so they would be located on top of each other without having to bow.
It wasn't just about building a platform, we used a steel structure so that the height of both the top and bottom space was right. '
That position allowed Erfani to create two full-height rooms on top of each other in the room, along with plenty of dramatic elements.
The half-floor opens with an old copper light from the Retrouvius window to a glamorous living space beneath the view.
The head-to-toe gold furniture, silver detailing and retrograde Serge Mouille's lighting accentuate the style of the space.
Using mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, space and light saturation.
Mirrors have been added to both ends of the short corridor to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, a back wall with a mirror gives the impression of a window opening into another room.
At the entrance, the mirror offers a storage place for all Joanne's meals and glass requirements.
The living room adds to the charm's chance to close the kitchen part if not used, creating an image of a more glamorous space.
Assemble kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this kitchen is the fact that it is a garage type revolving door.
"A bit of design effort went into it," explains Erfan with steel strength from spooned MDF-ust.
'it has a counterweight, which is why it limbs very easily if you push it up. '
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra metres, an extra bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"At the end of the day, the floor surface is what you sell - or what gives value to property," says Erfan.
'the real estate agent steps into the room in outdated form and makes calculations based on the surface of the floor. '
Here they have been able to increase floor space by using high-quality materials that add luxury to the space.
"Materials are the ones you touch and thereby help create an emotional connection with your home," says Erfan.
'you don't fall in love with the power cable in the wall.
It's important but it doesn't make heart languages ringing. '
It shows that good design and increased surface area will help to make something amazing from a fairly ordinary apartment.
In fact, they might even create a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
Protagonist Dane Jensen is a scalp hunter in a Chicago skyscraper who competes with a colleague for professional heights.
There is nothing other than the amount of money earned, alongside which any ethics is forgotten.
A man can only see his wife and three children in the early hours of the morning and late at night.
In the first half of the movie, I taunt myself from the thought that this is, after all, a version of the business world of "House of Cards" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's voiceover is similar.
The movie goes on, the less the camouflage element remains, and the moralizing intent of the filmmakers is beginning to look more and more.
The life-changing experience will be the protagonist's son developing cancer.
Now we have to make a choice between work and family life.
The son, who is dreaming of the architect's office, makes his father's walks to Chicago's big buildings think about really important things like faith, goodness, love..., untouched, not even the disaster of the twin towers.
After the third scene in which the son opens his father's eyes, there is a sense that filmmakers have approached the goal of getting the audience to cry, for even the most callous heart viewer can't hold back tears by seeing the suffering of a lovely cancer sick boy.
When his son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, his father finally understands the morality of his work and does a charity for an old man looking for work.
Now, in a sense, I bet on myself - if the movie has a happy self, I reward my thoughtfulness after the film with coffee, if I am wrong, then the screenwriter can be commended for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there is a suspicion that you will miss the coffee - when your husband calls Dane from the hospital and a man rushes in slow motion along the corridor towards the palace.
The son has famously healed, however, and even though his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can also feel good - I can quite predict the end of the American drama!
In truth, the film is well designed, all the elements required for it are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and moral beautiful: Money isn't the most important thing in life.
I think this movie will bring in well.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it as well.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the White House's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information reaching President Trump, including news, in the hope that it will keep the top in more subdued water.
Here's a split from reporter Josh Dawsey:
'when John F. Kelly, the White House's new chief of staff, got together with high-ranking officials on his first day in office, he pointed out a key problem for President Donald Trump at the White House, which he planned to solve and getting bad information into the president's hands.
Kelly told officials the information needed to move through him, whether on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it too, and they have failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV viewing habits have gone nowhere.
"When candidate Trump was upset about unfair media coverage, he was paid to show that he was also fairly reflected in influential publications," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politicole in February.
Politico's Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "the key to managing Trump's Twitter habits, according to six former campaign staff, is to ensure that his personal media consumption steadily includes praises as well."
Very well.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter usage habits have ever been "in control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something the rest of us don't know that Trump sparks would have been even more infuriating without these interventions.
We'll probably never find out about the sparks that Trump didn't post.
When his helpers were able to save him from the wreckage a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from consistently causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House of clicks competing with each other, people are trying, without exception, to promote their own interests by passing on material to Trump that supports their worldviews, but may not always be reliable.
Reflecting the course of the entire story, Politico wrote in May about advisers' tendency to feed information of strategically questionable value to the president.
One of the examples, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher, reads:
'current and former Trump subordinates say Trump may respond to negative press, especially with damaging effects on leaflets, exploding, taking an obsession with identifying their source of origin.
That was also the case in late February, when someone happily gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, a website owned by internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson that accused Katie Walsh, deputy chief of staff, of appearing to be the source of "a number of leaflets" from the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter due to mocking, or that he did not offer any specific evidence or that he has also made false accusations in the past and withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and began asking subordinates about Walsh. '
Goldmacher added that Reince Priebus, then chief of staff, and Rob Porter, the head of the White House office, "have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents reaching Trump."
How did it succeed?
Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump remains impulsive and his helpers are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians who came to the capital from abroad are not eager to obtain permission to appear.
There are a lot of foreigners musing in the centre of Tallinn.
Those with whom the Hill got the talk confessed to playing in the Old City without permission from the city administration.
First, we found three street musicians near the gates of Viru who had taken the same number of dogs with them.
It was clearly evident that musicians with rainbows and broken clothes were backpackers who would take one shower for a berth.
Despite the appearance, the group's only woman played a story with a fun rhythm on the accordion while one man gestured beside her with three balls and called the passing closer.
A third man had sat next to them on one backpack and smoked a heartbeat himself ready to turn the plough.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be distracted by the passing people.
Bob, who played the accordion with Noemi and the balls, spoke of musing on the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the group's performance was to collect the ticket money on a ship travelling to Finland on the same day.
On the question of whether they asked for permission from the city for musing in the Old City, Noemi and Bob shook their heads.
First, we didn't know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple and are mostly granted permits for a month or something like that.
There's no point paying for it, "Bob explained.
When we got back to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw two women being with musicians and driving them away.
The group moved to the intersection of the Viru Centre with backpacks and dogs to touch luck.
Three Polish young men also appeared on Viru Street, one of whom played violin, the other a clarnete and the third was even carrying an electronic piano.
"We're here to provide entertainment for people to spread music and joy, and to make money for fuel and living," explained the trio of pianist Mivosh.
Mivoshi said they are aware that there must be a city government permit to appear.
"Of course we don't have it," he said jokingly.
But we're hoping that when people enjoy our music, there's no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we'll go elsewhere, but you have to try, "he added.
The Bank of Estonia bought €149 million of bonds in July as part of a public asset purchase programme for central banks in the euro area, while the central bank's bond portfolio increased to €4.36 billion.
The central bank does not disclose more detailed information on the purchases.
In response to a request from members of the National Assembly, the President of the Estonian Bank, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained that the asset purchase plan for central banks in the euro system includes three different purchasing programmes: Bonds covered by the financial sector (covered Bonds), assets secured bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors who have sold bonds to invest money elsewhere.
The impact of purchases will fall on the return of lower-risk assets and will motivate investors to take greater risks.
As a rule, as part of a public bond buying programme, each central bank buys its own government bonds, while other countries do not buy bonds.
Since Estonia has not issued bonds, the Bank of Estonia makes so-called replacement purchases within the amount allocated to them.
Replacements are also made by central banks in those countries where there is a limited supply of bonds corresponding to the purchasing scheme.
The Bank of Estonia generally buys bonds from the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank, according to Hansson.
The Bank of Estonia has been buying bonds under its asset purchase programme since March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering bonds were acquired, but in June 2016, the Bank of Estonia will no longer buy Elering bonds.
On behalf of central banks in the euro area, both Elering and Estonian energy bonds will be bought by Finland's central bank from June.
Travelers ignore ditch, and return to "millionaire divisions"
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners have been caught up in a furious confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored a ditch dug by the council to win back a field away from their wool.
Riders have parked their 20 trailers on the field as a wealthy "millionaire rajoon" near the baptized Solihull Street.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks after they were kicked out of it only in May without letting themselves be mixed from a ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the defensive limits, squeezing its vehicles through an unblocked section that had been left on foot.
Maruvious residents have axed Solihull council, saying the council was "useless in dealing with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday evening after they were evicted from Bentley Heathrow, where they were stoning the passing.
The council must be shamed for them to take action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The migrants were there in May, they were driven away and now they're back again.
There were more of them last night, probably more today. '
He added: "Birmingham council knows how to deal with such things by getting long barriers to protect their parks.
I live by Streetsbrook and I'm not happy that I have to keep paying council tax if the council can't even prevent this kind of thing. '
A local resident, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: 'This is ridiculous; we only saw the last of these migrants leave, and there is already a new offensive.
This time the number has increased and the grassland has even seen the horse remembered. '
A spokesman for Solihull council said: 'We are aware that there is an unacceptable campsite on land near Streetsbrook Road and we are working with Solihulli Police. We are taking the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
It will be very helpful in gathering evidence if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
It helps create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them. '
The Weekend Festival will be visited by Indrek Saar, the culture minister, among others, who is pleased that real world names have been brought to Estonia.
To the question of why the Weekend Festival is so important for Estonians, Saar says that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the festival's three days in full.
He admits, however, that the real players in his area have come to Perth.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre are brought home - this often does not happen in our hands," says the culture minister.
Which artists at the festival, however, are the most telling of the island itself?
I consider myself a relatively old person and for old people like me, it's definitely one of the most experienced artist Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
After all, according to his platitudes, all of us have turned our feet at some point, "he says.
However, he still points out a number of names, such as the Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian players too: Starting with NOËP and can be read in a whole series.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high, "she says.

Audi updates up to 850 000 diesel vehicles amid criticism that hit automakers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it was offering a software update to more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW's chairman said the company believes there are "smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities, including BMW's hometown of Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it would update three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
No company described these operations as a recall.
European carmakers have been keen to advertise the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
But nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
It will also increase the cost of equipment installed to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German carmakers are under thorough investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of ringing powerful automakers and ignoring signs pointing to the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes, who quieted down the use of so-called scaffolding devices that allowed emissions to be adjusted to comply with regulations by the time the car was tested, but pulled back under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics subunit of Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may go on trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade requirements for European exhaust emissions, thereby expanding an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi's involvement in the investigation could be a major blow to Volkswagen, and the luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
European Union flags are acquired for €20,000 for Estonian schools.
By 1 September, the Ministry of Education plans to buy European Union flags to mark the presidency.
In total, 570 educational institutions of the European Union flag will receive 105x158 centimetres in size.

Journalist's murder highlights growing threat situation in Mexico
Weekly Riodoce workers usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in Sinaloa state, sown by organized crime, corrupt officials and relentless drug wars.
But today, under the guise of personal tragedy, they have gathered to discuss their own safety.
They are told it is important to change their routines.
Two senior writers discuss which seems safer: Whether to bring children with them to an office that was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard at the head of the room: 'Enemies', 'neutral', 'allies'.
They're asking reporters to provide the names of every column, there's no need for evidence, there's enough impressions and infighting.
Drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being employed by government or cartels, and a whole list of males making it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
There is no break of breath from violence, and the more bodies accumulate across the country, the majority of them are made up of journalists and, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, since President Enrique Pena Nieto was sworn in in December 2012, at least 25. 589 journalists have been killed in at least seven states since the attacks and threats under state protection.
The latest deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence gives a deep sense, though his presence may be perceived everywhere: On the facade of the Riodoce building, a large picture of Valdezis showing an average finger, along with the letter "Justice" and two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts featuring his smiling face.
The meeting comes less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmare, their sleep, their paranoia.
Although a separate public prosecutor's office was set up to deal with the cases of journalists in 2010, only two cases have been brought to justice, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most annual murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime, which amount to thousands, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodoce's editorial continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without murderers' data and justice, there is not much to gain from a meeting on security, according to Ibarra.
"It's very silly to waste your time here at the meeting," she says.
'as long as the cause is unknown, you distrust everybody. '
Valdez left Riodoce's office in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive only a few quarters before the two men stopped him in the red Toyota Corolla. He was forced to get out of the car and was shot 12 times.
An armed man drove away in Valdez's car and made an accident in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left behind by a wife and two adult children.
Rumours spread freely in Culiacan.
However, there is essentially only silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival clicks struggle to fill the power vacuum.
It doesn't matter that a few people or even several are shot every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is dwarfed by abundantly decorated double mausoleums of drug kings larger than the homes of many living.
Let's forget for a moment that peacetime suggests that only one cartel runs a seaside state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this, and the fact that Valdez was thoroughly aware of the dangers of his job, Ismail Bojorquez (60), the co-founder and chair of Riodoce, feels immense guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes the killing was encouraged by two errors.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with rhino Damaso Lopez, a cartel that competes with Guzman's sons and is on the wardrobe.
This piece of writing may have angered the sons and suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they reached the newspaper kiosks.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for the sake of his own safety after the crackdown took place in another newspaper report that echoed the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had stayed alive for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would be there for ever.
He worked as a veterans reporter at Noroeste newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling $50m shares.
Bojorquez said Sinaloas "was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem."
The newspaper raised awareness with its bold and honest coverage over time, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish robust studies without fear of censorship and readers were fascinated by the print from which they could read stories no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its Latin American coverage.
That same year, the Valdez Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow the Mexican drug story wherever it leads.
She openly admitted she was afraid.
"I want to live on," she said, accepting the AKK award.
Last October, she told television channel Rompeviento TV in an interview that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
'you've got to embrace the task that comes with the journalist profession and another way is to play footy.
I don't want to be asked what I did when faced with so many deaths, or why I didn't talk about what was going on. '
The Riodoce collective will miss Valdez, a jockey who rode like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
She always wore her villain.
She went to the El Guayabo bar across the road from the office and always sat on the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love was fatal to him.
His death has also led them to question themselves about how best to do their job and stay alive.
'They don't like juggling with these women, their children, their legal businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs. '
"These things should not have been touched," Bojorquez said.
The result is, even at the best of times, strong self-censorship and self-care.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspiciously, stay away.
According to Andres Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's how it happened to Javier."
He and others say the old rules no longer apply in Sinalo, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros or other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodoce staff got together for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before it was revealed that only spyware sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers sought relief from the 40-degree heat in the shadow of a tree.
The government appointed them to guard Riodoce's office, a four-storey building in Culiacan's middle-class neighbourhood.
Some reporters pondered, half-joking, whether these police officers were among the 50 percent of police officers whom the governor himself has labelled as unreliable.
It has been several months since reporters have travelled to mountainous rural areas where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
Riodoce's edition this week addressed three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story of spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were robbed of one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement as to who was kidnapped or how it happened, so you had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: The restaurant is a place for both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered to the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption as part of widespread coverage of cases.
Villarreal asked a reporter to write about previous incidents at the same venue, including how the son of Guzman, known as El Chapo, escaped from the military.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched Valdez's column to get information from the best sources about the kidnapping.
"In the past we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, whose drunken body construction has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
'now all channels of communication have broken with our sources. '
Valdez's office has become a storage space for labels and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they never expected, activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of labels and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in western Michoacan state three days after the killing of Valdez.
A burned body has been found, and officials say it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal and scratch the phrase "SOS press" as an organized protest on walkways and buildings.
That day, President Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
A day after Valdez's death while meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spitting for journalists and killing them because of telling the truth.
After that, he asked that he be diverted from coverage of government activities elsewhere, worried that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "restricted" by organized crime, complicit state officials and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narkopress, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs but also done at the behest of politicians and security forces who are in a mesh with organised crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks by journalists to police and public officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because you want to be kept quiet," Ramirez said.
The murders are obviously having a verdtardy effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found with a letter presumably signed by the cartel Los Zetas, "I'm here for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were leaning next to his makeshift head.
Some outlets have decided to close their doors, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after their correspondent Miroslava Breach was killed in March.
Others let on as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after their leader's murder in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke publicly to the drug cartels with a headline on the front page, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It is a nerve-racking decision.
It's hard to find work in exile and they still have to whip the streets to avoid the dangers.
And sometimes they are driven, as presumably happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in a Mexico apartment in 2015 three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain in place and continue to work will have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that coverage of the drug business scares her.
"Mexico is on its way to hell, and that's why I'm going to be a reporter," he said.
On one recent Friday midnight, when the latest number had already been locked up, Riodoce editors sat on a walkway in front of the office and ploughed beer when suddenly everyone's phones started vibrating.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people had died, according to confirmed reports of fighting between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as did several messages left by cartels found in the area.
From the edge of the walkway there, reporters put the news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
The front page of the next day needed to be changed.
The siren huddled along, another exchange of fire in the area.
Bojorquez lashed out at police officers on guard to see if they are vigilant.
If they were afraid, at least they did not show it.
Under a massive portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, with his average finger seen throughout Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff delivered in his footsteps.
"How could you even think about closing," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day Javier was killed, the trainee asked me to send him to the streets to report?"
Dinosaur used protective colour to avoid enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though quite scary.
Scientists have unveiled the now first findings regarding the state of incredible rhino research discovered by a chicken miner, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
It is even so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that his armored skin had a red brown colour and his past had been somewhat "complex."
The report, published in the journal Current Biology, described the creature as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossils are a new species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the cricket era, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation raided the researchers, who describe it as "really significant."
This vegetarian covered with Finns is best preserved by the type of fossils ever found, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was found on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk, when he extracted at Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that didn't resemble the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossils discovered were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The next six years were working to extricate the animal from the 2500-pound (1100-kg) plot.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be made public.
"If you kiss your eyes a little bit, you can almost believe he's asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the present is displayed.
'it's going to go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the addition of dinosaurs Mona. '
While researching her skin, the researchers found that this vegetarian, while covered in armored and resembling a walking tank, was likely to be significantly threatened by mushroom dinosaurs.
This dinosaur with plenty of armored used red and white protective paint to hide from predators, and applied a shadowy technique called counter-eclipse and also used by many modern animals.
That allowed the dinosaur to better delve into the surroundings and avoid enemies, according to experts, as the larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt for him.
This creature, a family of 110 million year-old nodosaurs, first arrived in the news in May and is now being visited at the Royal Tyrrell Paleonthology Museum.
The researchers have now studied the present and gave it a name, according to Mark Mitchell, a laboratory at the Borealopelta Marmitchelli Museum, which was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours exposing the animal struggling.
Thanks to the astonishingly good preservation of his father, Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the Finns on the animal's body.
They discovered a counter-eclipse - a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, meaning the top half of the being was darker than the bottom.
While the counter-eclipse is common, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is far greater than the animals with countereclipse living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was sufficiently actively jammed by other musculoskeletal dinosaurs that evolution preferred eclipse instead of confrontation as a survival tactic.
But most of the animals using modern countereclipse - such as terriers, pigs or armadills - are much smaller and more vulnerable as a harvest, suggesting that nodosaurus had to really struggle to survive.
"The forceful yelling of a dinosaur covered in enormous numbers and lots of armies shows how dangerous predatory animals could have been from the dinosaurs of the cricket era," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the armored organic compounds also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Researchers are continuing to investigate the animal to get clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its intestine, to find out what the animal ate for its last eel.
They believe the dinosaur crashed into a river in death, thereby reaching the sea with the flow, where he sank his back in front of the ocean bottom.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to stretch far further inland than they are now.
'this nodosaurus is truly remarkable as it is completely covered in preserved armored skin, while it has also remained three-dimensional, maintaining the original shape of the animal, 'said Brown.
'as a result, the animal looks almost the same today as in the age of cricket.
You don't have to use much imagination to reconstruct it - it's just enough to carve your eyes and it seems like he's sleeping. '
The crisis era was a time when huge musculoskeletal dinosaurs - teropods - were stunned on Earth.
Although their all King Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been startled by some of his formidable predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 metres) long and a monster weighing six tons.
The researchers, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was propelled into the sea after his death and it mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk, when he extracted from the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armored, and is a complete congregation up to the wooden.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Two 20 inches of ora tuned out from its shoulders.
Scientists believe this armo-covered vegetation ventured through the current West Canada until the flooded river boarded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial site helped preserve in excellent detail its armies.
The fossilised remains of this particular isle are so well preserved that myriad armored plates along the dinosaur headlines still cover the skin remains.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: "This level of preservation is as rare as a concussion.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The remains of fossilised skin still cover myriad armored plates located on the animal's collar.
The right front leg leaning next to him, and five of the thieves are browned upwards.
I'll be able to count the Finns on his farm. '
How one activist found an answer to the question "Who's streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell suffered a complete shock.
Just days after traveling to New York, this St. Louise resident sat on a bed in a rented room via Airbnb, browsing Facebook on the phone.
She ended up on top of her former schoolmate's post.
It read: "Police have just killed an 18-year-old youth and he is still leaning on the street."
He was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on his stream, which is why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
The bride @ TheePharoah user's posts had been repeatedly shared on her timeline.
A toddler from the St. Louise area provided a real-time spark about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black young man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
She posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that lebas on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's insane," Ferrell thought of himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
She put her phone away but saw a spark again later in the evening, this time announcing a gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
Photos of police tape and screaming people were shared, and a man claiming to be Brown's father and holding a label with the letter "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a real-time stream with a policeman standing in front of a group of protesters with a grabbing dog.
In another video, he said, another police officer wrestled a gun and shouted, "I'll kill you all... animals."
Ferrell is reminded of how he caught himself thinking: "It's unusual."
"" It's not the kind of murder we're used to and what we might call typical. "
I felt scared at that point.
I was angry and crying. '
She booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
Having landed at 23, she went to her father for her six-year-old daughter and decided they would travel to Ferguson in two the next morning.
What happened with Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years will be a central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Whose streets?"), which premieres in cinemas on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness from the perspective of the people who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell, along with her daughter - who was wearing a floral dress and a crown fit with it in her head - traveled to Ferguson, they once again chatted about a topic they had repeatedly had to talk about before this morning - about the experiences and living conditions of black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for their rights?" She recalls asking herself.
'we're currently travelling to Ferguson because police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right. '
"I couldn't take him with me," Ferrell said later.
'What's happening right now is... the culmination of what has happened in the past.
She needs to know and see that and grow in the middle of it.
He needs to learn about activism and organizing, while also getting to know the different layers of black experiences and living conditions and what we need to do to get free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise him in a way that he doesn't personally experience blatant racism, he's no different from some other black Tütarchild.
I feel like I would do her a disservice if I protected her from this world. '
The first stop they made when they arrived at Ferguson was on the way to South Florissant - a place across the road from the police station, which had become a kind of campsite where activists were waiting for news of police officer Darren Wilson, who was ultimately not charged.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined forces with a local business owner who prepared lunches.
They put food bags together and helped distribute them to protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism completely changed after August 9," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louise, he was president of the Association of Minority Teachers and focused on food justice and health-related inequalities in black communities.
'i didn't have any organizing experience.
It's all just ruined. '
Weeks later, Ferrell met one of the film's co-directors, Sabaah Folayan, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and filmmaker Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was happening.
Ferrell's head came up with the question: "Are you trying to document what's happening or find a story that can be exploited?"
Such skepticism was the result of countless incidents where people - often white - come into the community and try to profit from its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson would not be heard and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already shaken hands with fellow director Damon Davis, an artist in the region who was known for activism in relation to prisoners sentenced to death.
His involvement made the project appealing for Ferrell and six other locals watched by the crew of the film "Whose Streets?" For years after Brown's shooting.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, but we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
'it was important to me how these people are portrayed as that's how I am portrayed. '
While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was intended to show that the movement was not about "a redemption leader but a community coming together," as Folayan said - he became the movie's most open participant.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" Documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the finished squad.
'but I realised that doing this job and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability. '
What's more, Ferrell's story underscores and replaces the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three initials, who figured out the hashtag # BlackLivesMatter on social media following the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, are homosexual.
"Black homosexual women in a leading role have generally maintained the movement," said Ferrell, "and that's precisely because we have to keep fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to carry all that burden. '
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women, and many of them are black gay women."
He claims, however, that "this is not some type of equal opportunity creation thing" - Ferrell was not chosen as the focus of the film because of his identity.
"She was a person who was blown up with the right energy," she said.
'but it's no coincidence that he was stationed directly on the front line, because there's a lot at stake as a black homosexual woman living in such hubs.
His energy can be perceived through the screen. '
Meanwhile, news cameras have long disappeared from Ferguson but racial ties between community and police remain fragile.
The suspended sentence handed to Ferrell for blocking the highway during the demonstration will last another 2.5 years.
She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere in an area she calls home, simply as a "huge bowl."
Nonetheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra he has eaten in memory since he took to the streets of Ferguson as much as three years ago.
'it's our responsibility to fight for our freedom.
It is our responsibility to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We've got nothing to lose but our chains. '
7 tips to get over the poppy after Weekend party
Some of the weirdest men's sons find, after a meticulous feast though, that what trouble, hence help.
Or based on the saying "avoid poppy, gun drunk."
But it's just an inevitable postponement and a decent pitch for health.
What can you do to feel better in the morning after today's and tomorrow's Weekend trash - or other party - and overcome the poppy as painlessly as possible?
Drink water.
On and off alcohol, after a big party in the morning... or, if possible, instead of alcohol.
As the body loses a lot of fluid when consuming alcohol, you have to get it back somehow.
Along with water, minerals are also sneaked out of the body and sestap is good to drink mineral water.
As the snake is often irritated after the snapshot, it is especially good if it is bubble free or only lightly gazed.
Go for a walk.
It certainly wouldn't cost a poppy to head to the grandmother to smell the trees - it could prove a fatal misjudgment.
But a light walk helps the body again to remind you what it's like to be alive.
Lying in a tent and sleeping out Pohmaka is a more time-consuming way of healing.
Give the body energy back slowly and cautiously.
If you're already getting okay from yesterday's overrun, it's certainly not worth trying to load a big fat crack.
Start with fresh juice, for example, in which the fruit juices are quietly used to boost your body.
If health is already suffering around the South, you could try pulling, for example.
And, a little later, a selfie.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will free your body from the last water.
As has already been said: Water and juice are your friends.
Don't contribute to painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent poppy in the evening, your tax must deal not only with alcohol but also with paratsetamol or ibuprophen and thus lose performance.
This is how you break your liver even more and, in the future, the bowls are worse.
In addition, the painkiller doesn't last very long in the body anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it in a pretty empty stomach - it irritates your already torn stomach.
Or, if you don't have a partner, get along well with yourself.
It works about the same as walking, but you can't orgasm when you walk.
Avoid too active pace and exorbitant shops, however - the physical effort should be moderate during the poppy.
Make a joke.
Time with friends and fellow sufferers stupid talk, make simple toddlers and laugh amicably over themselves and others (suffering).
Joke and laughter may not drive away the poppy, but it is certainly more fun to endure the afternoons.
Once the pohmell goes over anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee are being sought as suspects in murder
Police say there is a nationwide search for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who has become suspects after finding the body of a male with deadly stabbing wounds from a Chicago luxury apartment.
According to court documents in Cook County, arrest warrants for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were issued on Monday on charges of first-degree murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed repeatedly.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
Police officers received a phone call and found the victim with multiple tornadoes on his body when he arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment building.
Officials said Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and investigators are treating the stabbing as murder while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president of public relations, said in a statement sent as an email that Lathem had now been temporarily removed from his job and was banned from entering the districts of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal case being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant at Oxford University's finance department.
A representative for the university and Somerville College said in a statement forwarded as an email: "We have been in touch with the British police and ready to help the US investigative authorities in any way possible."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to hand himself out.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the Chicago Police Department's communications department, is urging suspects to give themselves up to authorities.
"The police have an idea where they are staying, but we are working on defining the exact location with increasing intensity," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said both local, regional and national authorities are helping to search for suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from the administrator of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic hint that something had happened in apartment No 1008.
According to police descriptions, this was a gruesome sight.
Guglielmi said it was not clear if the event itself took place on July 27.
She said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's presence in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
Grand Plaza's management sent a letter to residents: "Police are currently working to establish the chronology of events and the background of the victim and are investigating a variety of motives, including the possibility that it was a family dispute."
Start-ups to help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce start-up, but the polls were futile.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"The system just wasn't consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company selling hair care products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called for the help of outside persons.
Start-ups working on new types of human resources are emerging to help companies figure out what their employees are feeling.
By developing and licensing software whose firm goal is to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to conduct sudden surveys, target solid teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hot line for complaints and, in some cases, allow keelectors to bypass C-level managers and turn directly to the board.
"There are now tools like Strava and Fitbit designed to monitor health, but where's Fitbit for your company?" Asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Erretti says he has received a much better insight into what his employees are thinking and feeling in the three years he has used Glint.
In addition to surgeries and surveys aimed at certain teams, it offers a corporate heat map that provides insight into which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing it to identify the causes.
Companies have begun to realise they need to stay up to date with their workplace culture so as not to become the next Uber, which has been entangled in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing a harrowing environment where those who dared to speak out were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, wanting to have an insight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global area of management, regulation and compliance could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to data from financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a start-up based in Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, observed an increase in interest and activity this year amid Uber's dubious reputations.
Convercentil has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered itself as a client.
Like Gling, Convercent lets companies send custom impulse polls, collect confidential responses in real time and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, the complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has been anchored by regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if it is found that the company treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, the company could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, staff departures and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure workers are aware of the rules and operations and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporation's headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the phone number or email address of the corporation's headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope it would be taken seriously.
It was often a discouraging and awkward process, said James Vitrano, general counsel at Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
However, now that the company uses Convercent, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices, which did not previously reach managers operating in offices in other cities or states, can be identified and dealt with more quickly.
'i'm able to get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of staff, 'said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday risk management group.
'and we're protecting our shareholders from litigation with employees. '
Quinlan said companies started taking ethical behavior, values and employee engagement much more seriously in 2002, after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until 'social media became mature' that companies realized they couldn't stop their black lingerie from washing publicly online.
"Before using the technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service by taking periodic fees from companies for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supportive of both start-ups.
Convercenti was funded by firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital for $10 million in February, raising the value of capital it raised to $47 million.
Glint invested $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments come as no surprise given the interconnectedness of business, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that today's workers expect more from the workplace than in the past.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are merely the stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued, and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission.
"When people are happy at the company, feel they're being listened to and that the work they do is satisfying, they're more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, vice president of the department for general benefit and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income if their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they find support.
Having data on employee involvement is important, according to experts in workplace culture.
But that data will be useless if the company's followers don't do anything with them.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it could raise expectations that there will be changes ahead.
And if changes are not happening fast enough, or not at all, it can cause frustration and reduce worker involvement.
"When you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consultancy and business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies make a mistake by relying too heavily on data collection.
"Because if things are not brought to an end, the staff will think," Are you actually going to hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care? ""
Erretti said Madison Reed, who now conducts once a month of research among employees, has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from staff who were disappointed with the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, he was able to restructure several teams at the company and provide communication training to deal with problems.
However, ruby Tuesdays will collect new data on workers and it is hoped that in the long run this will lead to a longer term commitment of workers in an industry known for its high labour flow.
"If you're not committed to ensuring transparency, you lose people," Vitrano said.
'and if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you'll lose businesses. '
The bright star of the eurozone is Baltimore: Incomes are growing fast
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes in reference to a report by the European Central Bank.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, the total economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Success is driven by low debt, rapidly improving institutions and business and free-market friendly policies.
"The Baltic States in one of Slovakia are among the few countries in the euro area where real GDP per capita in purchasing power has significantly approached the EU average," according to the central bank.
Although the aim is that total economic output per capita would equate to a richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita amounted to just 2 / 3 of the average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Baltics to seek better wages from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light, and the economy will grow this year, local residents are not at all enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the population in Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies are doing very well, or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, just under half of those surveyed thought this about their countries' economies.
NCAA's decision to cancel tours that take place twice a day makes Bruins days long
The clock is almost 23 when trobikond UCLA football players stop for a chat at the edge of a new practice field in the team's university district.
Some of them have choked off the back of the shirt, revealing a sweaty back from their training camp first-day efforts.
For much of the team, those power minutes offer a midday break.
Players taking part in summer courses are heading back to the joint lease after three hours to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Centre for meetings at 6.30am the next morning.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the tours that take place twice a day to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer - at least until the final exams get to one side on Friday.
For that reason, UCLA's first three coaches were timed to start at 19.15 to fit into the players' already busy schedule.
The transition from two coaches a day means more days with one trend - the start of the Bruins' training camp was raised almost a week ahead compared to last season and, for the first time in Mora's six Westwood seasons, training will take place during summer courses.
They have 18 sessions scheduled until August 20 before official preparation begins for the opening game against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he is in favour of an NCAA rule change, though it will add another item to the players' tight schedules.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days and it's a serious challenge," Mora said.
'and they break themselves through this challenge; they're struggling, they're nice young.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we've got more time, it's really nice. '
Once the camp is complete, UCLA's training will make it closed, however, which is by no means an easy task given the clear view of their fields from a nearby parking spot and the stand-out Luskin Centre, a higher-class hotel that has already been hit by football that has escaped from the defensive net around the gate post.
The hotel will be occupied by Bruins players from this weekend, but Mora admitted there could be problems with free rooms throughout the season.
"We take security measures," Mora said.
'it's a real worry and it's not at all exaggerated to think people can rent a room and film training out there.
If you have a record of training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we're using a security team there and on the 8th parking spot.
We will do our best by using what we have.
I try not to worry much about that.
We've got a plan in place. '
In retaliation for the middle-born Savisaare-Ivanova electoral union, Kristiina Ojulandi, who was expelled from the Republican Party, and Maria Kaljusi, who was forced to leave the ECB to join forces, Our Tallinn, and Tegus Tallinn, the electoral union of businessmen, which is creating a place for the parties, at least, in the local elections.
Snaps will be counted in the autumn, however, and the key question will be whether there are enough frustrated voters for all of them.
Who will stay with the island?
When a small group of supporters of Edgar Island has shrunk, the events organised in honour of his electoral union can be guessed.
One member of the House, some former and current middlemen and many unfamiliar faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And is there a reason why some of the faithful followers and friends of the island are being excluded from their candidacy in Tallinn?
A music video filmed on the roof of the town hall for a Russian-speaking poplaulu attended by a senior in Lasnahile district; and, in every sense, a rudimentary computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, the protagonist, must avoid the lomps and slaves on the road as he travels to the ballot box for the first time?
We look forward to seeing what the other parties are thinking of a youth election campaign.
If the Channel 2 or TV3 viewers are viewed by a black square instead of an entertainment show since the beginning of August, there will be two choices: Accept that, from now on, only ETV, ETV2, ETV +, Tallinn TV and the English-language France24 channels will be seen in the freeway, or surrendered each month to some TV operators.
There are probably also those who at first rejoice in the unadvertised TV experience, but at the end of the day, albeit reluctantly, pay for telephony and advertisements.
Deafening music, a fledgling nation and rubbish left on the streets are the unpleasant side phenomena of almost every major music festival.
If you don't want to be part of the meme yourself, however, it's worth going home to discover your home instead of shaking your head - and leaving the bedroom for a hefty amount to festival guests.
Washington changes green card rules
Media outlets quote President Donald Trump, who says a new U.S. immigration plan is scheduled to change green card rules.
The plan foresees a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people a year, stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and the president supports them.
The bill is going to be debated in the two chambers of Congress.
'this law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money as it changes the way the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law reduces chain migration and will replace the current program.
The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the funds to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy, 'Trump said, according to US media outlets.
Siberian seto young people move to the city, pensioners back to land.
Yevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous seto gold miners along the former Maana River.
She works from home 140 kilometres from the ground as an additional driver in the cullar tent along Kuvai.
It's a tough job: Two months in a row without rest days 12 hours of work and then just ten days at home and back again.
In the three years worked in Artel, Anatoli has seen gold only once.
"There's a hard order: Going in is thoroughly checked so that the bow doesn't lead, and going out not to take the gold with it," says Anatoli.
Mare Piho chatting in Haida village with local seto John, who has told him a lot about his family's memories in Siberia.
The archaic culture still preserved in Siberian sethos is also beginning to affect home-setos, because it's just so fabulous, thinks Piho Mare, who has studied remote setoes most thoroughly.
This year marks the 30th anniversary of his first research trip to Siberia.
During that time he has been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many pigeons did they migrate to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in order to gain land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I would argue that 8 000.
I reckoned it out by the tales of Siberian seto men who have thought of it themselves.
It is difficult to say exactly because up to 30 people may have come from one group at the time, but the passport was only given to the man.
The passport was given to only one, but he had children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look at how big this territory was here!
It was many times larger than the historic Setoma.
After all, it needed to be educated, managed in some way.
They came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (palm parting), gold mines, industry.
In New -Petser, for example, many pigs later went to work in the classified town of Krasnojarsk-45 (where the Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did they make up the majority of the population in this region at the time?
Yes, they lived in a compact way.
In addition, there was a long tradition of marrying each other and having many children.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How much did the culture of Siberian sethos differ and differ from that of the native pigs?
They are different, though what was brought here was never the same there.
They brought with them a great deal of popular ideas.
They then made their own (folk ideas), but they always made a distinction between what had been brought along and what was done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional clothing of pigs, because it is colder here.
Foods changed.
For example, Setomaal meat was salted, but here it was just frozen.
Where are the Siberian setode villages and what life is lived there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The bond with the motherland was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
I feel like now it's going to give Setumaa back there, it's going to affect them.
Those girls who have lived in families here have been listening to amazing stories.
Piho means the people of the Estonian setode delegation who came to the village of Haida in early July, Seto Kingdom Day, and lived in homes for four days - J. P.
That's what's left here, it's fabulous.
"It's extremely easy to come to Tapa and also go away because the city has a great location: In the railway hub and at the intersection of roads," says Reigo Tamm, an opera specialist from Tapalt.
The city is not just a military capital for a long time, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural sites, and the seal is on every corner.
TAPA is a top-topping city!
There is a small island along the Valgeriver running through the city, where tapals tend to hold a hunting party.
"It doesn't look like this beautiful place from a train window," said Reigo.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of sources.
I have been swimming there though, you can do it!
You can hold a picnic on the river's roll and just make a romance - you can gaze at the river's flow and think about life ahead and behind.
I've been walking there with my brides, too.
Tamm, an opera scientist, has, apart from anything else, been on the river bank between the three bridges practicing his amateurs: "Since this place is by the city, no one may be responsible if I tell my stories."
"A wonderful view of Tapa opens from the mountain of the game, but there are also health scans where you can run, ski in the winter, and currently play discgolf, for example - the golf course is done, the kettle can be borrowed from the sports centre," Reigo leads.
The old pros, of course, go there with their wells, but I have not yet come to play there.
Obviously, my colleague, Rasmus Kull Tapa, must be invited to visit because he is an experienced discgolf player and has discs.
Maybe he'll lend me!
Reigo and the mountain of play were inseparable from the times of the childhood of the current opera.
At least during skiing hours.
There's a lot of tears left on that mountain, disappointments and victories in my sporting life.
Not to mention broken watches and snacks.
"The entire city centre is currently full of construction, all of it becomes unrecognisable," praises Reigo.
TAPA's old and tired whale building, however, is a very attractive place to play summer discoveries.
I am pleased that in 2012, the head of R.A.A.A.M, March Meos, accepted my idea and had to make a whimsical summer theater with his theatre.
While this year's theater season with "Aleksei Karenin" just came to an end, on August 11, the railway station has "Elluwaking" when the old whale building moves around in the 1980s.
"Between 11 and 13 August, there are days in the city of Tapa, with open home cafes on top of the whisky building and riding cultural events taking place, including crowds," says Reigo, who just recommends visiting the 91-year-old city in the nod days.
In a tiny yellow bedroom on May 1, the museum has been in place since 1994.
"The house is small, but there's a good deal of exhibits and information tremendously," Reigo praises the site, complete with the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focus on rail and warfare.
Reigo muses that if Tapal goes through all the recommended sites, the stomach is going to be empty for a long time, but thankfully the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good meals and sitting in cafes sometimes get the feeling you're abroad," he describes.
Educated and young soldiers who come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so there is a strange feeling when you sit there that you are in Estonia and in your home town, but there is such an international community together.
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we are moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The TV channel bTV quoted a foreign ministry reporting that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of August 1, police arrested a group of people illegally camping on the Sithonia peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but an investigation is under way.
The foreign ministry told TV channel BTV that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free tendering and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone caught holidaying in a place that is not intended to do so.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Wolves teaching puppies go breaking sheep.
Farmers in Hiiumaa will have to give wolves "teaching material" from their herd again after a year's break - apparently the wolves who taught the puppies have already broken a lot of sheep.
This year, wolves have broken sheep in Hibs County three times, with a total of 23 sheep and eight injured, says Hibs Leht.
The corresponding figure was only three, up from 124 a year earlier.
Also in sync with the bursts are data from the Environment Agency that wolf nests were not born in Hiiumaa last year and information from the Hiiumaa hunting council that two wolf nests have been fixed on the island this year.
On the night of Monday, wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in Emmaid and injured 18 surviving lamb parties.
In the early hours of Wednesday morning, wolves broke a sheep in the pasture of the village of Reheback and badly injured another who had to be subjected to an emergency slaughter.
Rules on the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the introduction of GMOs into the environment and the amendment of the Plant Protection Act.
The amendment to the law forbids the creation of a separate set of data for both genetically modified (GM) crop locations and handlers, using a plant health register in the future.
In addition, the GM crop handler's obligation to have a prior agreement on the prescribed radius with the beekeeping person will be changed.
Although no GM crops are currently grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non-GM crops.
This is at least as long as there are no decisions to declare Estonia GM-free, "said Sigmar Suu Kyi, head of plant health department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both private and public sectors," Suu Kyi added.
The draft law repeals provisions relating to the data collection and handling training of GM crop locations and handlers in GMOs, lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and the commencement of economic activity.
In particular, with regard to beekeeping, the current obligation of GM crop growers to inform beekeepers about the start of GM crop cultivation will be replaced by a commitment to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before they start growing.
The draft law has been sent to ministries for coordination.
All interested parties will have the opportunity to examine this in the information system and, if they so wish, to submit their opinions to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The proposed changes will affect, in particular, those in the field of plant farming, beekeepers and the Agricultural Agency.
Only one GM crop, maize MON 810, is allowed to grow in the European Union, including Estonia.
So far, however, none of the Estonian farmers have been interested in the cultivation of GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no landslide in Estonia, a European stewardship, which is resistant to MON 810.
The varieties of this corn line have also been bred to southern areas and this May is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In order to gain security, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect pollution with possible GM organisms in the seeds of various varieties of summer shakes, corn and soya grown in Estonia.
Analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds were not included and the study concluded that the seeds of rapeseed, corn and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that GM crops are not deliberately cultivated in Estonia, and it was also confirmed that there had been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Maticu in the form of "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited a 'genius' in the form of Nemanja Maticu, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The player, who was bought over from Chelsea for £40million, started in Dublin in Unified's last pre-season game ahead of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday with a 2-1 win in the original squad, impressed in a defensive role while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on offensive trips.
But having been sidelined by the Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Maticul was badly left in need of a matchup and only held up for 45 minutes, which Mourinho said needs to be improved from the firm before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant mindset - he has the mindset of football," Mourinho said.
'we're going to help him achieve form as soon as possible. '
Like Matic, other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the starting lineup at the Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho began quietly putting in place his kind of starting man for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed the club had already done "great work" by signing contracts with three of his four priority selections.
'i'm grateful to the club that they were able to execute three out of four, 'he added.
'i'm even happier if they can make it four out of four, but they've worked hard for me. '
Another bowler was caught on the leg by a GSM transmitter on 1 August and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird observer living in the Ring, the first puppet became an embassy equipped with the Ring, and this baseball team is already flying around, has left the nesting site and joined a large collection of nights in Mullutu-Great Bay.
This is because there are no crops in the Ring, writes the Voice of the Islands.
This Tuesday, relatively late to ring the Kurds, another puppet became attached to the embassy, and on the island of Muhu.
Martinson said installing transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
One of the puppies, called Mati, was supplied with a GSM transmitter on the Ring in Turkey.
"His actions are all viewable online: How he went to winter in Spain, coming back for a long time on the German and Polish border toppas and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
British inventor allowed to install a microchip in his own body to get into a house and car with a handgun
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he could open his front door with a mere handset, get into the office and even launch a car.
Steven Northam, 33, allowed a tiny chip to be installed between his thumb and his name finger and is now also offering this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals looking to make their lives easier with technology.
She has joined forces with consultant-anesthesiologist Dr Geoff Watson at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants, Winchester, to ensure the installation procedure meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip mounted on cats and dogs, and the procedure takes just 30 seconds.
Northam's company is also changing the locks of houses and cars to make them compatible with the chip, charging £300 for one lock.
This married father of one child has installed the technology now both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which launches when his hand is on the wheel.
White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands
According to military documents released to TIME magazine, the White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter cost taxpayers as much as $24,000 for an event celebrating American production last month.
The green and white color Sikorsky VH-3D, called Marine One during the president's boarding, was central to the event featuring American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials on their tour of industrial products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, which was built in Connecticut, was displayed together with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a fork made in Mississippi.
According to documents from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), an escapist responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House military cabinet insisted the presence of the helicopter was partial, or FARGOs, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the southern courthouse for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it's an unusually high-profile event," the HMX-1 commander said in an email to his superior, the Navy's leading officer deputy in aviation the day before the event.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at the southern courthouse for an event starting around 7pm on the morning of July 17 and will remain there until the evening is cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on the same evening.
Added was the fact that if you were to leave the White House, you would need a second ejection for a return flight because of restrictions on working time.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the escapist's security team stayed near the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
Of the documents given to TIME magazine, it was not possible to find out whether or not a second ekipage was eventually needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether this event could violate that provision.
"We asked if it would violate the Hatch Act, and we were told not to break," the commander wrote.
"It looks like you have no choice," the deputy lead officer replied.
The White House declared the event an "American-made" official event and the Hatch Act would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The president backed the health-care reform effort that was under discussion in the Senate at the time and praised efforts to keep government regulations in jeopardy.
Using an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents need to use them to travel.
However, the requirement for them to be used purely as a photograph is unusual.
Trump came to the spotlight in February when a president's plane was transported to the background at his first campaign event in Florida, Melbourne, and his Twitter account tweeted messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"The white house is very pleased with the display of" American-made "featuring products from all 50 states made by American workers from American materials," said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokesman.
HMX-1 teams often make samples around Washington and in the southern courtyard to practice putting down the president of the United States to the White House with centimetre accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 hosted 58 test landings in the White House yard.
The official said the flight was believed to be among the standard for "American-made" flight crew training flights that month.
Escapist helicopters flew an extra 11 hours that day for "unrelated support missions" with the president.
According to the White House, no other exhibit at this event burdened taxpayers' wallets.
Sikorsky's representative said the company was not involved in organizing an exhibit on the southern courtyard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget documents for the president's flights and it is difficult to find out the exact cost of the event.
But according to the Defense Department's hourly prices for the 2017 financial year, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24 380 per flight hour.
Escapist documents noted the length of the flight from its main base from the Navy's Quantico airport in Virginia for 30 minutes in both directions.
The White House argues that the real cost of using a helicopter is well below that amount.
'calculating taxpayers' costs based on estimated compensation rates is very misleading, 'Walters said.
'these estimated compensation rates include staffing, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that will be taken into account in annual appropriations. '
According to a 2015 RANDS study, the Department of Defense's compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they do cover the cost of fuel, maintenance and contracts.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the event at the time.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
'and I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be contributing to our national security and that there are expected to be hundreds, if not even thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment on which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
So of course it's right to highlight that. '
It's not clear whether or not Trump encountered a helicopter while making a tour of the southern courthouse as part of the event, but he did sit behind the wheel of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump turned to Sikorsky's representatives, tweeting jokes to media outlets about the company's products in his personal aircraft park.
"I know Sikorskyt very well," the president said, "I have three of their products."
Grit Shadeiko - through tears, peace and joy arrived
At the 2011 Met Daegus, Shadeiko was hit in the last area, with a foot ramp in the 800m, and the stadium was taken away by a pie with a carrier.
Just before that, he had gotten zero in the distance at the Universiade held in China.
The 2012 Helsinki EMI was breached by a low-key injury but, in a debut in London, he won by 6013 points to 23.
The misfortune, however, continued.
At the Moscow Mall in 2013, the spokesman, who was on schedule for the opening day, suffered a thumb injury in the distance.
Two years later, he won 15th at the Beijing Games and filled the Olympic standard, but that was a disappointment for an athlete who wanted more.
The heaviest camouflage went through Shadeiko only in the past, when he could not at first sign the result at the Amsterdam Era.
I would just like to put together a proper multi-contest once.
Once ', Shadeiko sprayed.
Worse was yet to come: A month later, his Olympic competition in Rios broke down at the first hurdle because of the reunion.
Time had to be taken down - can we continue with seven races at all?
Are two days of effort still worth all that?
He thought for a long time, but he found peace.
I got my head clean to think
That experience is relatively hard to describe, but I've thought last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Luckily, there was time to heal yourself and think your head clean.
"I knew I wouldn't put the pills in the bag yet," Shadeiko says of his self-cleansing.
I was able to turn a clean sheet and get on with the new momentum.
Coach Anne Mäg said the caretaker's suffering was very difficult to watch, but she realised that, above all, the athlete himself had to find out.
After all, he was so buried by everyone.
It was hard to endure.
"Grit, however, said he doesn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth," says mountain.
Now he has some kind of peace.
She does it to her own delight.
The offense came back in May when Shadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the Götzis multi-competition.
In a high-profile contest, he improved his personal peak in the Six Nations with nearly a metre (13.89) and ran in a record-high time barrier.
Then several contestants felt that it was not at all a ceiling of ability, but that it was only the primary hunger.
The mountain, which has guided him for years, says that Shadeiko is a black student.
He's a willing athlete, he's good to train.
If something does trouble or is wrong, he'll say it right now.
He knows his own body and trusts his feeling.
That is what we need to build on.
I cannot say what exactly needs to be done and we will follow it.
Shadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not one to make the most of the trash," he says, and says that the most important thing is getting the right feeling, because it also provides a good result.
Loved ones' baby happiness makes you happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Shadeiko by the happiness of loved ones.
Both his former coaching partner Maris mountain and sister Grete recently became parents, and several contestants have received support from new weather citizens.
"It's been pretty interesting," Shadeiko says.
One alcohol whose drinking equates to "training" of the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that he believes - with wine you can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
It is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but it is about the 'very active' process of tasting wine.
By sniffing the glass, spinning the wine in the mouth, enjoying it and sensing the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for wine.
Sheperd says veinolecules do not actually contain taste, but taste arises from the way wine stimulates the brain.
She points in comparison to how the brain "sees" colors.
"Taste is not in wine, taste creates a wine tasting," says Sheperd.
Things that still affect the flavor of wine are, for example, our age, gender and even the amount of syringe that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, admits that wine is not to drink yourself full.
"There has to be more in action," he says.
If you take too big a slice, the system is oversaturated.
Excessive wine drinking can harm the brain instead of benefits - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine risk loss of memory, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity.
10% of workers in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than colleagues
Figures from staff search firm Fontes reveal that 10% of workers in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than their colleagues.
The ten percent pay gap is between men and women, writes portal genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the Fontese ICT sector pay survey.
A total of 8 577 posts were examined.
63% of posts were held by men.
"While only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and the rest of the companies believe there is no pay gap, in reality, compared to similar works among themselves, the basic salary of men's month is, on average, 10% higher than that of women and men's total annual pay, on average, 8% higher than that of women," said Fontese analyst Ilmar North.

UN says Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Assistance Mission, said hundreds of women were standing in local council elections, three women standing as vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of the role of women," she said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and only be credible when women fully participate and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
Afghanistan's local council elections and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
For its part, the Taliban have threatened an election process that coincides with a period of transition when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time power is transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysomi said a strong role for women will increase the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes every thing more fierce, both large and small.
Common time is always too little, but the trench with the rings provides a good opportunity to combine meeting, game, closeness and load.
And what a convenient solution - no matter where you're cruising in the summer, live hangers are always with you and impatiently remind you of your fine voiceover: "Let's get on with it now!"
Start with a warm-up - it's very good to have a normal golf game or tie along the beach.
Cook is the mainstay of staying in the shape of legs and tubes - so who would want to take the shape of a swollen sand cake from the waves over the summer?
It is wonderful to use children instead of chicken!
First, it's safe and comfortable, with gravity slowly growing at the same pace as the trainer's power.
The advanced ones will also be able to cook with pretty big children.
The child coaches balance, counts repetitions and feels fun about the opportunity to walk high and be important.
Larger children can make their own heating at the same time.
The scale of the movement put in place by touching the ground and browsing your hands up.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the miniassistant to hold properly.
The child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
The plank is superb, but a hopelessly boring exercise for the child.
But it's easy to make things more fun!
Gamble-plank: Take a long plangucolonel from which to wander through.
In fact, harder than usual, but much more fun to do when, in the meantime, you can give a friend a hand.
To add to the load, you can stay on the plank, tiny turf, and walk around in that position as well.
An additional difficulty can make a minor child sit on the hip, but this exercise offers fun for all children.
While crabs sip on the sand, triceps, tuhar and abdominal muscles get a load like an infection.
The child descends on his legs so that his body is distributed equally in front and behind.
For security, you can hold on to your hands.
Curve the legs and sip straight up.
Pluck can fly, have fun, train the balance and be a difficulty.
The life of a little coach is exstraling when he gets a little bit of it every coming up.
The extra load gives the legs browsing in advance.
Check to keep your back in a neutral position.
The children themselves have a lot more fun doing abdominal muscles in a pair and a plaque.
Cook with hand work and pulse.
Follow the child's safety, knee position, and keep your back in a neutral position.
All children's favourite and great fun!
For the older, at the same time, a really effective whole body trench.
Ott (10), Säde (8), Happy (4) were sporting gear.
A trip from the Philippines to the heart of a wide world, or Õlgkot, moans
Bags punched from shoulders are a summer classic that has become a hitting product in its own right in recent years, even having to hang at the end of the hand on one of the right souvenirs, and which merchants, despite its modest origins, have been able to boast an additional price tag for hers.
A bag punched from shoulders is probably one of the things that has existed every single time in life and has not caused any particular emotion.
It just exists, and if it doesn't, there's nothing broken.
Now, though, the shoulder bags are making a real triumph, and movies have changed their fine designer bags for summer months against bags punched from simple shoulders instead.
It is not just a beach bag, but today it is just as popular as a street bag, and bolder women even walk into the office.
At this point, however, it is worth making it clear whether a summer look like this is still sitting on the top, or whether a notebook and a laptop are still worth pushing into a slightly more formal summer.
Alternate wealth, however, has made shoulder bags a true summer love for women.
For example, when reading foreign moeblogists, the first thing that stands out is that the fashion gurus are the first thing to do on a holiday trip to the local market and acquire a few bags of beer, which are then faithful throughout the holiday season, and which comes with the beach, the market and also the girlfriends on the city.
Some bloggers are even so generous that they buy bags on the market for a bigger bunch and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting, however, that there is so much demand for bags among readers that, in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go out to each other to become the happy owner of a few bags.
In some ways, this madness is also understandable, as rare are the times when, in fashion, it is possible to buy some of the things that have gone into the construction industry for just a few decades.
True, rogue merchants have also discovered a simple money-making option here, and so the finer luxury brands are selling straw bags for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Probably still so that richer customers don't have to feel like plain mortals who probe around with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy a beer bag worth more than a thousand euros in Dolce & Gabbana.
However, you can go out for a Chanel shoulder bag interpretation in a round of €6,000.
Unlike most mostruts, however, the beer bags do not come from some of the great fashions, but their story began far away.
In fact, the bags of beer are said to come from far from the Philippines, from which they have been carried out on a large scale.
Punching a bag out of the shoulders is primarily an export business there and the locals are very often not seen going around with them.
Reportedly, the blistering technique dates back to the 14th century and is quite horny with conventional corn bunting.
However, as you don't have to punch as heavily as a basket, musters and other materials can be immersed in them, making the bag more personal and, by extension, more actionable.
For example, there have been particularly trendy bags recently, with coloured paws or leather scraps punched in.
However, a letter of gratitude can first and foremost be sent to the actress Jane Birkin, whose biggest punched shoulder bag fan had not been seen before.
Notably, she matched her shoulder bag to all kinds of clothing sets and didn't even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival for much of it.
However, what does not play a smaller role in the popularity of bags nowadays is that caring for them is a cupboard, and unlike all kinds of other sumadants, they do not need to be maintained by special means, but also by water and a wet towel.
As with trend robbery, apart from the classic look, brands have come up with all sorts of interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you may be able to buy a rifle or a tiny straw bag.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, but it does.
But, so what's the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, the kind of shoulder-punched bag that resembles a basket from its style has been considered classic, and there are short, as well as shoulders, pitches.

GMB is worried about investment in the company's McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union expects executives at cookie maker McVitie's to confirm long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company has been silent on the future of the Tollcrosse site investment.
The plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, said they had invested more than £5m in the site over the past few years.
More workers were hired there and union chairmen "will be the first to hear" if something changes in factory activity.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland appealed to the company McVitie's to "allay concerns that funding is not used to modernise production lines."
Drew Duffy, senior organiser at GMB, said: "The fact that we don't get clarity from the site's chief executive on Tollcrosse's business needs and future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and the people around Glasgow, an essential pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social exclusion.
So the east of Glasgow, in terms of jobs, wages and welfare, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic declines in production, urgently needs a thriving company at McVitie's. "
A representative for Pladis said: 'The Tollcrosse site manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will respond directly to him as we value active communication with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between staff at Tollcrossis and representatives of the GMB, which openly discussed a number of issues.
We then discussed with workers that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our activities - and this applies to all our companies and sites - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5 million in the Tollcrosse site, most of it has gone into production lines and improving operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcrosis as a production site and should there be any change in the activity of the site, workers and union representatives will be the first to hear about it. "
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago of an approach to Neymar?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on trying to attract Neymar to their ranks, making a £189 million bid for his buyout, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record conquest trip?
This hardline approach has opened the summer transfer window, and the Ligue 1 club are ready to break more than double the current world record of overbuying, set last season with Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for £89 million.
Once completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player as a result, and also the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, who will receive more than £500,000 a week after taxes from PSG.
Barcelona are known to be angry about the manner of approach as well as breaking Neymar free, although a source close to the Catalans board confirms that the club has always taken the best care for the footballer since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi harshly warned any clubs thinking about recruiting some of PSG's best players.
'i'm not worried because they know that if they concern some of our players we will confront them and contact those players, 'said Al-Khelaifi.
'we respect all the clubs.
But if they're trying to make a deal with some of our players, they have to face the consequences. '
Barcelona appear to have stepped over that limit as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made clear they would not let the Italian leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could get a setback as a result of that interest, losing one of their expensive assets in Neymar's form.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders after Brexit.
"Brexit seriously threatens to strike a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned during his first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: To build bridges, not borders," he stressed.
Varadkari said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and because it cannot, to remain part of the European single market.
It would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the UK.
Another way to streamline Britain's departure would be to establish a customs union between the European Union and the UK, the Irish prime minister explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "Surely we could have one with Britain."
An alternative to this would be a return to customs points that would include historical division and political failure.
"A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish prime minister.
He called Brexit "a challenge for our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of daily life in the North East.
The Irish prime minister met the leaders of the main parties in the North East while visiting Belfast.
Through his first half-long triathlon, March Avandi: Ironman can be passed by anyone.
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltic States was held in the winter capital Otelul, when approximately a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries entered the semi-long Ironman competition.
The 70.3 mile distance consisted of 1.9 km swim, 90 km of cycling, and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, March Avandi also triumphantly completed the first triathlon of his life.
"I thought it would be difficult, and in the end it was difficult," Avandi said in the finish.
Despite the complexity, Avandi concluded that, in fact, the triathlon is an affordable head for all.
"It's not the distance that will kill, but the pace will kill," he said, suggesting that almost everyone will reach the finish at an affordable pace.
Except for Ott Sepp: "Everything is fine with his fury, but alas he can't swim."
Avandi had been keen to make the move since February.
At the beginning of 4-5 hours a week, and later, ten hours a week.
At 05: 34: 12 he scored 270th overall.
Although Avandi lost both Raio Piiroja (time 04: 59: 53) and Jürgen Ligile (time 05: 06: 37), he won other contestants in the so-called "class of proponents."
Tanel Padar, who was a "good example percussion" last year, lost to Avan in seven minutes (time 05: 41: 54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05: 50: 23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06: 31: 53 and 06: 45: 18).
The overall winner of the men's reckoning of the Otepää stage, which is part of the Ironman series, was chronicled by German John Moldan at 3: 58: 27, while the Estonians had the best Ivo Great at 04: 14: 09.
Among the women, Dane Helle Frederiksen was victorious at 04: 24: 01, while Maria Jänese, who lost to Frederiksen in nearly half an hour, won by 04: 58: 58.
Avandi underwent a 1.9 km swim distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in the 410th position.
