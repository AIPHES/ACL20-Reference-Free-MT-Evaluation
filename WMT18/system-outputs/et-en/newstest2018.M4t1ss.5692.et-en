four members of the Kemerovo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the Postimehe, police in Spain detained the so-called Kemerovo group leader in the Estonian alliance, Slava Gulevich, known as Slava Kemerovski, in the criminal world.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of a court.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects detained in Estonia.
It is suspected that these are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal association aged 27 to 57, who commit drug crimes mainly.
An alleged head of a criminal association was detained in Mijau, Spain, in Malaga province.
Three men were detained as suspects in Estonia, one of them, according to the data gathered, is a leading figure in the criminal association, and two are members of the criminal association.
The data collected indicate that tasks and roles were clearly allocated in the criminal community.
Activities of the criminal association were intended to commit drug offences and thereby generate criminal revenue, "commenting the head of the pre-trial proceedings for the criminal case, state prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We are not ruling out that there will be an increase in the ring of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been interested in law enforcement in the past, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Ms Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues had been prominent throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation demonstrates the success of the collaboration," prosecutor Verte commented.
Ago Leis, chief executive of the Central Criminal Police Service, said the detentions were preceded by a preliminary investigation of nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, a longtime piece of work was realized and we were simultaneously in Estonia and Spain suspicious of crimes," he said.
Leis added that Central Criminal Police officers were assisting in the sentencing in Spain.
For years now, we have good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can get them from another part of Europe, "Leis said.
The information gathered so far shows unambiguously that, while at liberty, the men suspected may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the Prosecutor's Office has requested their arrest, and the court has approved it.
The man arrested in Spain is awaiting his surrender to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized in order to ensure confiscation as part of this criminal case.
Criminal case pretrial proceedings are conducted by the Central Criminal Police's Organised Crime Bureau and run by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In 2005, Slava Gulevich was convicted of racketeering and sentenced to five years in prison by the Tallinn City Court.
In the middle of the previous decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world, following the then-allied leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Kemerovos, rose to prominence in the Estonian alliance in the early 1990s when he began to deal with blackouts in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes at various hotels and charged a monthly rooftop tax on businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of proceeds of crime and the court rulings that have entered into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest court rulings, eight defendants separated from the so-called Dikajev criminal association criminal case, confiscated 80,000 euros of criminal revenue, or the verdict against nine individuals in that Igor Aleynikov set up a criminal association in 2006 aimed at illicit trade in counterfeit cigarettes and the committing of trafficking crimes in East Virumaa and southern Estonia.
The confiscated proceeds amount to around EUR 71,500.
In these criminal cases, it has been a success for police officers to exchange information and evidence with their foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, to carry out operations together in any European Union country.
Civil rights group warns of travelling to Missouri
Black people travelling to Missouri have been warned of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
A statement from the group read: "The NAACP travel note issued for the state of Missouri, which runs until August 28, 2017, invites all Afro-American travellers, visitors and missaries to be particularly attentive and supremely cautious as they move around the state, given the whole rod's suspicious racial-based events that have occurred recently across the state and also been evicted here."
According to NAACP, the group was urged to issue a travel warning by both the recent Missouri Act, which makes it harder to win discrimination lawsuits, and the fact that minority groups are unequally targeted by state policing.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled off the edge of the road because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "NAACP Missouri branch president Rod Chapel told The Kansas City Star.
"We have never received complaints so closely before."
This is the first such warning that the organisation has issued for the US State.
A group cited events such as the racist insults toward black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Ms Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after she ran out of petrol while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General indicating that black drivers' cars are 75 per cent more likely to be stopped in the state than those of white people.
"A note is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and workmates about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared, whether it means taking in the bail money or informing relatives that they are going through the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, putting the state on 16th in the state for similar offences.
A travel warning is also in response to a new Missouri law that makes it difficult for the company to sue over discrimination in the search for housing or work.
American Civil Liberties Association (American Civil Liberties Union ~ ACLU) had issued earlier travel signals for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws obliging local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because, according to the ACLU, it increases racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have begun to use this measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D and E hepatitis virus.
All these viruses provoke acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, the malignant cost is chronic hepatitis B and C, which can develop further into liver cirrhosis, or liver wrinkle and liver strain.
Kuulo kutsar, epidemiology counselor to the health agency, says acute hepatitis symptoms are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, skating, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gray omission, dark urine, muscular and joint pain, and skin and flower masks KOLLASUS.
The popular name of liver inflammation, Yellow disease, also originates from the last feature of the disease.
Children can have hepatitis without any disease.
A variety of types of gastric inflammation can only be determined on the basis of laboratory study data.
Acute hepatitis can switch to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without any disease, meaning a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Kuulo kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progression more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, from an infected person's overexploitation to food, surfaces, objects, getting into our mouth and consuming drugs.
Family members and carers of the disease, people with chronic liver diseases, people who have sex with the infection, men who have sex with the infection, drug users, travellers visiting countries with high hepatitis A.
Infections can be prevented by vaccination, in particular by recommending vaccination for people travelling widely and at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to comply with daily hygiene requirements: Wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruit and vegetables before they are used for food.
Hepatitis B viruses spread in contact with the blood of a sick person, injection of drugs, tattooing, augmentation, use of blood-contaminated creatures (toothbrushes, pregnancies), donor blood, sex with a person of hepatitis, and hepatitis idiot from a sickly foetal/newborn baby.
A risk group of hepatitis B infections include injecting drug users, sex partners for infected people, men having sex with men, newborn children of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health care, emergency workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, and travellers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, people can be vaccinated; in particular, people at risk are advised to vaccinate, as well as people with chronic liver diseases, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Hepatitis B for other prevention measures is: Avoiding the use of hygienic and manicure tools, other acute means and needles, tattooing and augmentation, and using condoms in cases of infectious sex or avoiding sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan in Estonia and is free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses spread in contact with the blood of a sick person, injection of drugs, tattooing, augmentation, use of blood-contaminated creatures, donor blood, sex with the person of a hepatitis monster, and from hepatitis idiot to foetal/newborn.
At risk of hepatitis C infection include injecting drug users, sex partners for infected people, men having sex with men, newborn children of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health care workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, people with HIV infection and travellers visiting countries with high hepatitis C.
Hepatitis C is a preventive measure: Avoiding the use of hygienic and manicure tools, other acute means and needles, tattooing and augmentation of aliens and the use of condoms in cases of infectious sex.
No vaccine against hepatitis C.
D hepatitis is caused by a D hepatitis virus that reproduces hepatitis B in the presence of the hepatitis virus.
As a result, D hepatitis infection occurs, along with hepatitis B or as a superinfection, on patients with chronic hepatitis B.
D hepatitis viruses spread through contact with blood and other body fluids, contaminated syringe needles, sexually and infrequently infected mother foetus.
D hepatitis crosshairs are chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have anti-hepatitis B immunotherapy.
An effective prevention measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis e viruses spread along the feminine-orally pathway with drinking water and food, including little heat-treated beef, fish and sea shellfish, donor blood, common-use syringes and an infected mother to the fetus.
Passengers may be infected in countries with high levels of E hepatitis.
E hepatitis prevention measures meet hygiene requirements: Wash or disinfect your hands after having to go to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after being cared for.
Fruit and vegetables wash before consumption, avoid eating little curated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid consumption of drugs.
Although in the last round the competitors tried to force a four-time Olympic winner off the track, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long about pulling her husband Tania and the children along the track after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the path with them was wonderful, "Farah told journalists.
Farah is aiming for a fifth title race in London in a row of 5,000 and 10,000 metres running into the golden duubles.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connori's lady dives in gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait of the extraordinary story of "the birth of one artwork much deeper into the cultural life of Vienna in the late 19th century and early 20th century.
But more thoroughly in history.
Perhaps the harrowing information bubble would have gone away in a curved short-sleeve, a narrower topic would have allowed the title's promised portrait of an extraordinary story to gain more influence.
At present, there are, among some, two books: The story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted by Gustav Klimt and her painter in "lady gold," and the much more voluminous and comprehensive history book about respected Jewish families and the German occupation, with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to a cultural life in the middle of a powering Vienna and caught up in the Austrian capital, one can easily imagine how more than a hundred years ago life went around Ringstrass or how everything turned heads when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see the name you know in the book, you feel like a more grammar culture.
However, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was operating in a city where the flow of incurable syphilis and the highest level of suicides in Europe gave nothing more to the development of the story.
Or perhaps, however - every odd brush stroke also adds colours to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten people in Vienna were Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice to open up with Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and Klimt for her famous paintings, her father's bank had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburgs Empire.
But Adelet's not drawn all that glamorous life to which he belonged.
Looking at "The gold of Daam," it is hard to believe that towards the end of life, this glowing lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order her husband's portrait from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt's order paid 4,000 kroons at the time, a quarter of the price of a land house with a good location.
The fact that some of the portraits were suspected of having a love story with a model was not discouraged by the sugar magnate.
As for Adeles, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist that emerged from the work continued to the end of life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "lady in gold.
Gustav Klimti's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait of an extraordinary story, "Varrak 2016, English translation by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before the work started with Adelega, Klimt had visited the basilica at Raven in San Vita, and investigators think the glowing mosaics from Emperor Theodora, seen there, gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adelest as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Daami gold" in Vienna in 1908 and around the same time (between 1907 and 1908) each was born in the golden land of "kiss."
Art historians didn't notice the similarity of the two women.
How does Hitler relate to the story?
"I think to the memory of my friend Klimt I owe it to him to make his craft available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family's Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had each other's portrait of Adelest.
Also in her will (Adele left in February 1925), she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscaping houses in Austria's Gallery.
He inherited his jewellery to Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had finished "The Austrian Mona Lisa," an attempt had been made to get into the Vienna Academy of beautiful Arts by 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but failed in the drawing heat.
Although sometimes Hitler's later anti-Semitism is regarded as the reason that he was not accepted into the academy by Jewish professors, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery referred to in Maria testament had changed markedly by 1939, and it was important to find works to suit the Nazi party from Vienna's rich Jewish art collections.
Hitler's personal artistic treasures were matched by some of the work Adele had at home, but not by the Klimt.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year legal dispute between the Austrian Government and the heirs of Bloch-Bauers began.
It should be noted at this point that if "The novelty" is seen in Vienna at Belvedere Castle, the "gold of Daami" depicting Adele Bloch-Bauer will have to be seen travelling to New York's Neue Gallery.
And before the Vienna race read the aforementioned book.
Even if you don't plan to go and watch Klimt's works, because at least my emotions revolved more about the Nazi and Jewish issue after the book was closed than the $135 million sell-out painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer converted.
So not so much a portrait, but rather a transmitter, and a very moving story.
The Bauerite lineage, which was first introduced to the book, made it considerably easier to navigate the events.
17-year-old swimmer was very close to Estonian record in Canada
In the living adventure, Gold was very close to the personal record of his own 200 metres pig swimming at 2:16.62.
Tippmark dates back to a 17-year-old pig a week ago when the Canadian junior championship received 2:16.58 intercepts the Priit Aaviku dating blog.
Gold finally escaped as a tenth of the A-finals.
In the final, he went through a distance of 2:15.76 and secured a good seventh spot with a new powerful top mark.
Of the Estonian record belonging to Alina Kendzior (2:15.13), Gold was left to divorce for just over half a second.
In Estonia's all-time ranking, Gold rose third and his fresh personal top-scoring mark is the fifth all-time result in Estonia.
The young hope of the future is still starting at the Canadian Adult Championships at 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in freezer and at 200 M- and 400 m in bundling.
Last week, the Canadian junior championship was held in Toronto, and Gold made a successful start there too.
He won 200 metres in the freezer with a silver medal time of 2.03.22.
So quickly this distance was swamped by Estonians last 2008.
Only Estonia's record woman, Elina Partahka, has sunk this distance faster than Gold ever.
Estonia, which lives in Canada, won a bronze medal in the 100 metres free-kick with an excellent personal record and the top mark of the new Estonian season at 56.66.
For example, the elder Kertu Ly Alnek of the year has sunk that distance by just one hundredth more quickly.
He received a further 100 metres in the opening round of the teaser swimming at 1.03.69.
In half a longer distance, he only secured seventh place when scoring 2.17.31 in the final.
Gold is currently leading the ranking of the Estonian season on four different distances.
As President Trump goes on holiday, critics sharpen teeth
The holiday season has come - that is, a relaxation for US President Donald Trump.
But since Trump has been one of the president's most holiday days so far, critics are already sharpening teeth.
According to US Today and CNN, the president plans a 17-day holiday to spend at the owner-studded golf club Bedminster in New Jersey.
Although the president's holiday began yesterday, opponents of trump have been speaking for a week on holiday.
They are throwing too frequent a rest on Trump.
Notably, the president has the custom of spending weekend time in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villains.
Incidentally, Trump has not rested the president the most during his 196 days in office.
For example, George W. Bush ended up on holiday with that time as early as 67 days, while Barack Obama was half less than Trump, for just 21 days.
But things tend to sleep fast at Trump, though.
Days after becoming president, Trump said in sending "60 minutes" that there will be no time left for long holidays for his agency, as a huge amount needs to be done.
He also expressed outrage about Barack Obama's holiday three years ago.
At the time, the current president wrote on Twitter: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending brawls and junk concerts, ISIS journalists are cutting their heads off."
According to White House officials, the 17-day golf club visit has no polling for some relaxation.
It is officially called a work holiday, during which Trump has no time for reading or other sensational activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for working holidays.
Notably, the air-conditioning system on the West Wing of the White House is being replaced and therefore all staff had to leave.
In the West Wing, the Oval Cabinet and the other office rooms of the president are also located.
"I don't think any of you would like to be on the West Wing in August if there's 38 degrees and no air conditioning," said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman who stressed that the president would continue to work during the holiday.
From where President Trump will spend 17 days, you'll get a taste of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook yearning won't run for state office if you don't tolerate criticism from voters
The father of our country knew a lot about unfavourable media coverage.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start tearing him up for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism naturally upset him.
But he hasn't forced his critics into silence.
Because, in 1783, Washington said, "freedom of speech could be taken away from us, and in darkness and silence, we could be presided over by bluetongue."
It brings me to Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, who has to struggle to be more like Washington.
Posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on her official Facebook page have been blocked and deleted by Hogan.
And earlier in the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) sued ACLU for this reason.
Governor's Officer stamped the action as trivial, and web commentaries spawned reactions in the style of "Keda interested?."
"It is just Facebook," many said.
But it matters.
And that matters especially a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an astonishingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His approval percentage is the second highest in the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not an unthinking reactive whistleblower.
It has led the state firmly and has remained firmly committed to its principles.
In addition, he has used a rather adept Facebook as the main tool in communicating with his constituents, for example, after chemotherapy for the first time gracefully showcasing his guilla head.
Thus, on the Governor's page Vista, which is a public forum with official labelling, managed by the blocking of people visiting taxpayers' dollars' staff is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's conduct in an interview with The Washington Post, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than modeling.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of internet trolls, spammers or a nation full of hate online.
In The Post, several pretty people were interviewed by Hogan.
And that is exactly what they mean by pretty people who interact with their elected leaders. Teacher, business owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
All of them said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not at all pink.
In his post, the pastor cited the bible, oppressing Hogan's Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, a lawyer from Bowie in Maryland, did not incite anger but pretty much hate crime.
"I politely commented that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news reports," he wrote in a news conference for The Post.
'i also dislike the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same subject, some immediately call it an indifference collective effort, rather than acknowledging that it's a lot of concerned citizens.
In what the governor's official said was a "targeted junk attack," others would presumably call "public support."
Facebook-era allows messages to be easily matched by simply blocking a critique or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the old days when workers had to be sent out to do the same, so that they would gather newspapers with critical cables and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to remain silent.
But that is exactly what is happening now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for making a bite on Facebook and other social media outlets.
A president trump has sued Twitter users who have blocked him from the Twitter stream.
One of the first noteworthy court rulings on the subject was made last week in Virginia.
In Alexandria, US District Judge James C. Cacher ruled that the chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for Facebook and Twitter use.
It should not be that difficult.
At the time of Washington, affordable postal spending had a similar effect to the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers quadrupled the way he managed.
And even then, Washington had to chest up with anonymous trolls.
Folks wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making landmark decisions in Washington.
According to historic documents picked up as part of a project to collect letters from online George Washington, he burst into cabinet petitions criticising his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he did not make them quiet.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
And getting it right means accepting it.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ronan Rafferty hopes for home territory comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European head coach Ronan Rafferty is hoping for home territory comfort over the next three days when the East Lothian Renaissance Club takes place on golf courses at the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
North Irishman, who was leading the final round ahead of the final round at the nearby Archerfield Links radar last year, has been embroiled in a new venue and will perform the role of the tournament's ambassador instead of the club's founder and chief executive, Jerry Sarvad.
"I saw the Renaissance Club built and now we see the club shining in full glory with this event," Rafferty said.
'Game of thrones sees the track at its best, it's in a glorious state.
Jerry has done a great job of building this place.
He is a keen supporter of the golf game and is proud of what has been achieved here.
This is a great way to present the trail.
Englishman will ever look forward to defending the championship for the first time, although the man has won both European Touril and European Challenge Touril in his 32-year career.
'It is accompanied by a very special feeling, 'said the batting player at Southport.
'i couldn't defend my Extremadura Op title because it was taken off the competition calendar after a year of my victory.
Magical is to come back into that heel.
It is a great place to play golf.
I remember memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's win was special.
This was a very special time that we will always bear in our hearts.
Gary Orr, who joined the seenior European tour earlier this year when he got 50, will return to the competition again on home soil.
It is his first event in Scotland since taking part in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Op in 2013.
"It is always a bit more meaningful to play at home," said Orr, the Helensburgh man.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel the extra pain.
I have enjoyed playing again immensely and quite a decent golf game.
I am happy with the progress that has been made so far.
Trio will be joined on the pitch by former Mastersi tournament winner Ian Woosnam and seenior Tuur champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Mr Orr and former Ryder cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the competition, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge and car parking costs GBP 5 pounds to a car with one passenger and 10 pounds for two or more passengers.
All proceeds will go to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold-plagued countryside
If Bardina Degei prepares dinner, she won't use the penis.
He even uses pot rarely.
A wooden housekeeper in Enarotal, the capital of Papua province's Paniai regency, Indonesia's tar heist places a housewife on a bathtub called nota in local language directly at the base of the fire.
In half an hour, the embattled mugul will be taken from the fire and plucked eagerly into the skin with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor, he doesn't have his furniture, and he does his day-to-day chores, such as washing laundry with water from the nearby sex.
A toilet role is played by a bump in an umbrella-free room.
As the youngest of her husband's four women, she has not been appointed to look after any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late, however, may be dangerous; most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many of them drink hard, and there are still soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around in the village after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
It is a rare glimpse of life in Papua's highlands, a former Dutch colony merged with Indonesia in 1969 after the controversy sparked a referendum in which only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote by raising their hands under the eyes of troops occupied.
A move to get rid of Dutch supremacy hastened its outrage against the Jakarta government, which is still keeping the region under its strong control, keeping away foreign journalists and human rights watchers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papuaks and West Paapuaks, so independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is equally remote and deserted. To get here, you have to fly from the provincial capital Jayapura for 90 minutes to Nabires and then go through the five-hour journey of nausea with the rental car.
There is no public transport.
A city of about 19,000 residents is made up of tree houses surrounded by bamboo fences and cover wavy iron roofs, with rust transformed different shades into collar brown beans.
Very few Indonesians have taken the journey here, not to mention journalists, and there have been almost no foreigners here.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, honey Pago boasted painters of a goat called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing such clothes," Degei says, referring to her colorful hand-woven turkey, dark pluusi and a private skirt.
'Before that, we only carried plant leaves on the body.
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of Asia's worst.
But it is also a gold-plated land in Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Paniai, a mountainous province of about 153,000 residents in New Jersey, is located in the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua can be boasted of consumer timber reserves, which are estimated to be worth USD 78 billion.
But these riches are the source of the suffering of the tank trees as they result in the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times showed that Freeport paid around $20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The aspirations of Paaputes to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden tender and are mercilessly converted.
Human rights activists say more than 500,000 boats have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killing of genocide in the mountainous lands of Papua tribes in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the area.
A 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Birsbane, "We're losing everything," contains testimony about atrocities committed in the past year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to another report, particularly widespread rape and delivering electric shocks) and a brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims as such incidents occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Screws have still been turned down more strongly, as Papua's natural resources have caused an influx of newcomers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but the demographics are changing as black economic migrants arrive from the islands of Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi, Indonesia's crowded station.
Jaavals' family furniture sells a crispy chicken and mixed vegetables to gado-gado, served with peanut levels.
Locals cannot compete with them.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market more cheaply than local boats," explains Paniais-born 24-year-old Abeth You, who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura on behalf of the work.
"Indigenous Sapua mama-mama boats [women] will therefore lose their market share."
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president known among the nation as Jokowi, pledged to address these inequalities and human rights abuses in Paapua in his 2014 election campaign.
A former hip-hop star won 27 of Papua 29 constituencies on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, including Paniai.
But Paapuas has changed very little and locals feel deceived.
"It has broken our hearts since in 2014 we voted for Jokow in anticipation that he will live up to our hopes of restoring justice," You says.
In fact, Paniai was struggling at a low level just two months after Jokow took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotar sang on Christmas Eve by the bonfire, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle.
Distraught children told them to switch the front lights on.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was insulted by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
Drunken soldiers chase the children and beat them with their gun handles, according to victims and eyewitnesses.
One of the soldiers then shot into the crowd of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so brutally that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby Electoral Commission building was set on fire and things escalated further the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football field in front of a local police station and a military command centre to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting buses and presented Papua MEE pago with a tribal waita dance, during which Joost lap and matched a bird song.
A few protesters began swooping at the police and the military.
In an upsurge of outrage, soldiers were sent commanders through an indoor radio.If the crowd points to resistance more than three times, let them down," the official document said, seen by the magazine TIME but not issued to local media outlets.
Kayame (56), a senior parent in the Kego Koto district of Enarotali City, felt threatened and called for calm, asking the crowd to go home.
No one had the will to listen.
"By reversing, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he told the magazine TIME in his erratic colours on the veranda of a tree house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled.
"There was a lot of people, there was plenty of shots in the bag," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to a cousin who saw him shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that it was him," said TIME gloomily Yohanes, who uses only one name in the way of many Indonesians.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Chief Inspector Yotje Mende, of Papua Police, told reporters that his subordinates only guaranteed the security of his district because it was attacked.
"We must protect ourselves if we are threatened to kill," Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for Papua Police, said in 2015.
"This is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and there were plenty of wounded.
News of the killings only reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapuras gave a passionate speech in which he offered his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuse in Paapua.
"I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism to deal with human rights crimes.
But almost immediately apologies followed.
"Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and the early 2000s.
It is about us being committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes, "he said.
But speaking to TIME on June 5 in Jakarta, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying that he had no intention of setting up a mechanism in Paapua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, "everything will be settled by law."
Mr Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of human rights crimes in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the bloody independence referendum in 1999, said 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Papua, including what happened in Paniai.
Families of Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim disbelief.
"I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," Yohanes said.
"I am tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I am afraid," he says.
'i am afraid that the army will arrest me, I am afraid I will be shot.
His brother, Yacobus, confirmed the opinion that the Paniai people are afraid to sing the incident.
He said he got a beard out of the army after helping to bury four victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military had to look for me," he says.
Shootings have not ceased.
Indonesian police on Tuesday shot villagers in Deiyai, a neighborhood of Paniai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when a friend went between the villagers and the head of a construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man to hospital.
A man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned a fish while trying to get into a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested at a construction site in front of the company's office.
According to police, villagers dragged police officers with stones, upon which the latter responded with warning desks.
But according to locals, the mobile Brigade (Indonesian military-led police) began firing at the crowd, killing one person.
"We were in great panic, we were afraid of retribution," said TIME 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured getting involved.
'i have been hiding in my house for two days.
Deiyai's parliament has called for the police officers involved to be held accountable and for the police mobile brigade to be pulled back from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem place for the Indonesian government.
A lack of meaningful development fueled the discontent of the honey, mon, Dan and dammal tribes living in Papua's crippling central highlands.
Many of them have joined the army of insurgents from the Liberty Papua Movement (VPL) which, according to it, defends the rights of boats, carrying out casual attacks and kidnapping raids among Indonesian soldiers.
A few of the VPL's leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, on the pretext of the 'defence of national sovereignty', the army has arrested Paniais over the last few years and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them will never appear again.
Among Papua people, Panias is known as a "tragic forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotar is too expensive to buy for locals.
Bread is just as unattainable.
People grow their whole food manufactures mainly bathtub, plus a bit of fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five bathroom fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten bathtubs cost only 10,000 Indonesian spaces (75 cents).
Economic inequality has deepened over time between the combustible boats and the new migrants, who have been inundated since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist will go to better educated and more prosperous migrants.
Payet itself often lacks the capital or necessary skills to do competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in visiting because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Paapua.
In addition, there are severe restrictions on foreign media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Paapua for "not following relevant practices," though they had been granted rare film permission.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy head of the Asia department at Human Rights Watch, Jokow's election promises to lift restrictions on transparency and promotion of development have not been implemented.
"Journalists trying to report from Papua's most eastern troubled provinces and West Paapua in Indonesia are threatened by new threats to revoke the Swoboda visa and listing it on the blacklist," he said in a statement.
The absence of a drilling look at the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states, Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands, were spurred by the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "various large-scale crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Paniai.
These same countries have also historically supported the VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for Indonesia's foreign ministry, dismissed the accusations of grueling, telling journalists in Jakarta: "Democratic order and freedom of the press are still in place in Indonesia, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of human rights incidents."
Local people want more foreign governments to take notice.
When the Dutch official delegation headed by the country's human rights envoy kee Van Baari visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people broke their silence, according to the source who wished to remain anonymous, urging: 'We want freedom'.
New presidential elections are due to take place in Indonesia in 2019, but the Tories do not believe they will vote for Jokow again.
"Jokowi is a well-intentioned man, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants to make it clear to Jokow that, in addition to the Paniai people constantly living under the threat of a predatory army, they are struggling with squalid education and health services.
According to Gobai, Paniai people, like other boats, regard their voice given to Jokow as a debt he will have to pay.
"They do not need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of Paniai's shooting victims were able to cope with yet another symbolic insurgency. They buried one of the victims' bodies on the land of a police station and a military base.
Knowing that justice may never be done, at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with a felony head.
'What else can we do? '
Image copyright Reuters Image caption The fire swallowed up Dubai Torch for the second time
Fire eased through one of the world's most high-rise residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee that 337 metres high and 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that has ravaged a high-rise building in just two years that happens to be called the Torch, or the Trump Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of fire was reported.
'However, we slept and woke up to the fire alarm and shouting at people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down the 50th floor, "a resident who called himself George told Reuters.
According to civil protection officials in Dubai, firefighters extinguished the flame at about 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and chilled the building.
It said they were working to provide shelter for those affected.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on high foreign soil throughout the world.
An investigation carried out by the Torch board in the aftermath of the 2015 fire found that the most damage suffered was fassaadikes - exterior decorative panels and insulation.
Britain's police have said they believe the isolation and fasting panels of London's Grenfell Town could contribute to the ambulance spread of the fire there in June, in which around 80 people died.
See: These phones will probably become sales hits in the autumn
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, as they then unveil their new top models.
In the spring, the Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came on sale, new hitt phones are also expected for poelers in the autumn.
According to Tele2 marketing and sales director Kristjan Seema, the modern flagships are characterised by innovative design, eye-iris sänner, edge-to-edge 4K resolution display and ultra-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, the world of technology, has also reached the top of the Estonian smartphone sales ranking.
Autumn promises smartwatches even more wrapped fast charging, more durable battery, better-quality camera and greater water and dust security.
He added that celebrities can already make assumptions and predict the top four models that will presumably conquer sales tables for today.
Four of the smartphones' top models will still reach the poelers in the autumn of this year.
Long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to reach poelers as early as mid-September.
However, there is a lot of rumours about what the new Apple model will look like and what can be done with it.
If the iPhone 7 didn't bring significant differences to the iPhone 6s next door, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to see the new model completely separate from past ones.
Four colours have been spoken: Black, white, pink gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button has been lost and the fingerprint reader has been built inside the screen.
Apple's design manager JonyIve insists the new iPhone model looks like a smooth glass.
There has also been talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
A faster A11 processor can be expected, in addition to the eye-iris skinner, cable-free charging and a more quality camera.
It will certainly be one of the year's most anticipated smartphones.
A pre-ordering of brand new model Galaxy Note 8 will begin on August 23.
A lot of rumours have been leaked though about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It is reportedly meant to be even more for the business user, and S Pen allows for even bigger functionality.
A phone should have two cameras, one of which is a waistband and the other a TV lens with a narrower view.
No one knows yet what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test, which is certainly comparable in terms of quality to the iPhone 8.
However, we are looking forward to 23 August.
Although Nokia has put three smartphones at the head of Nokia 6 on sale this year, their flagship - Nokia 8 - to be unveiled as early as August 16 - is still missing.
Expect an 835 processor of the Qualcomm Snapdragon and a more robust battery from Nokia to a 5.3-inch ice-side display and ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of aluminium corps and a significant level of water and dust resistance of the IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras, whose optics are produced by firm Zeiss.
Once Sony's confident flagship has been the XZ Premium so far, the producer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future, with even more innovative features.
Expect a smartphone, albeit slightly more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least as good or better as the camera.
It has been speculated about Sony's new model that its display will be at least cute.
What reality will bring, we will be able to see very soon, because traditionally Sony has unveiled its Autumn Flagship at the IFA International Technology Fair, which will be held from 1 to 6 September this year.
According to transcripts leaked by phone records, Trump pushed Mexico on paying for the border wall
A Washington Post disclosed transcripts of a phone call between US President Donald trump and Mexican and Australian state leaders.
On 27 January, Trump went on a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop declaring publicly that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
An American president grabbed a wall with him for public condemnation, slamming: "You must not tell the press."
Trump erected his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall and age along the United States southern border that will make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, revealing a tense exchange.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal for the United States to take on refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous," nerdy "and" stupid.He argued that the deal, which was made under the Obama administration, would leave him a" steering "impression as he has proposed a ban on resettling refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the speech by telling Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not consider the complaint of the lines of the Private Limited MRP City in the case in which the city of Tartu rejected their tender for the procurement of bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a command letter which rejected the offer of the lines of MRP City of OÜ at the Tartu bus procurement because the tender did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuktin, Head of Tartu Municipality Law Service.
This is the procurement for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029 of the public bus services in the city of Tartu.
Lines of MRP City sued the Supreme Court over the decision by the Dorset District Court.
It was not prosecuted by the Supreme Court.
Although many on social media complain that the noise from the Weekend festival disturbs their night out and the entire city is full of drunken bracelets, there are many who have no bad words to say about the festival lasting on the beach.
I am even positively surprised that the festivities were so polite in the store!
I did not see any disruption or ruthlessness.
Even I saw kindness, "said Laine.
'It's great to come, to be, and to enjoy the Pärnu that has remained like winter days, 'he adds cheerfully.
The thorny Laine dreaming from the beach does not bother.
If, while living in the city centre, he heard that music was being played on the beach, now the music has not yet reached his home institution.
'But I hope I hear, 'he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who spoke with the fire, also tells us that the great festival is rather good for Pärnu - it makes a significant contribution to the working of local merchants.
He also rejoices that so many expatriates have come to visit the summer capital.
The woman in the master's life is not disturbed.
Although I am no longer on the beach, it is good that the beach has been revived.
And it is great that the people are moving and it has already been that way three times, "the woman says.
The first time I think it was a bit worse.
'Then maybe there were complaints, 'he contemplats.
However, according to him, the sea on the beach is common for the summer capitals.
"It Weekend is a very good Promo to our little city," says Harri, a famed Harri at the park.
Neither has his life-rhythm been kicked by the melu and the myth.
But for what?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this interaction between nations would be better.
A man of loud music does not blur.
It does not stir up, even though I live close to it.
'Good people can stick together and there is no mischief, 'she speaks.
Guests who came to Perth are courteous, according to him.
"With bottles, of course, they are also a little exaggerated, but young people are young and Lord god - give you a go, but be people and we can handle!" He says.
Coastal residents have been travelling away from somewhere by then, whether to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival affects life positively - people like such melu," says Tiina, who walked with children in Pärnus.
His family's dream festival music does not disturb either, although last year it came even further than this year.
Last summer the lava was the other way around, then we heard more.
We live outside the city ourselves, so that there is actually a very good place on the fringes of the Pärnu River, "he says.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and cuts dividends to revive business
British education company Pearson said on Friday it would cut 3,000 more jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent, thereby launching another restructuring program to address the business's impending predicament.
Manageable jobs, which will be concentrated, according to CEO John Fallon, in all likelihood between late 2018 and early 2019, will add to the 4,000 jobs lost during the previous restructuring.
Ms Pearson announced plans in May to cut costs by another $300 million ($394 million) under a third cost reduction programme to try to revive a business that has been hit by a rapid transition to digital learning.
A company that agreed to sell a stake in Penguin random House to its partner company, Bertelsmann, last month said their expectation for the year had not changed since it reported a 1-per-cent increase in sales revenue in the first half of the 2.05 billion pound of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked military convoys in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, according to officials.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident at the Qarabagh district of the city.
It is the latest in a string of acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque attack in Herat on Tuesday.
A suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul on Monday.
A NATO statement said the explosion on Thursday night took place when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "man-borne self-made explosive body."
All are injured in stable condition and are being treated at a US military hospital at Bagram airfield, the statement said.
According to correspondents, the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), are a source of serious concern for forces based in Qarabagh, NATO Bagram.
At least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, some 20% in the capital, according to the United Nations.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiite district in Kabul.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, a major bomb attack killed more than 150 people in the city centre - the most deadly military attack in the country since US-led forces ramped up the Taliban in 2001.
This violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of US troops helping the country's military and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA revoked after hawks delay decision on subway regulation
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (United State Environmental Protection Agency) annulled the decision to delay the introduction of an Obama-era regulation requiring states to limit smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency because of the move.
EPA announced the decision to proceed with "2015 ozone-fixing operations" late Wednesday, saying it shows the agency's commitment to working with the states.
"We believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our state partners and listen to them," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt had announced the EPA's intention to delay ozone-level approvals at MVs, which measure smog pollution in different parts of the country, to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to meet the tougher air quality standard in 2018 occupant.
15 mostly Democratic states filed a lawsuit with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, saying the decision was illegal.
President Donald trump's government has tried to pull back a number of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama. Trump said that this is part of a more comprehensive plan to boost growth.
But those efforts have sparked reactions among Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the impact of increased pollutants on human health.
An EPA website states that inhalation of ozone-containing air "may decrease the working capacity of the lungs and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases," such as asthma.
German pigs can come with a feast.
Germany's pigs and cattle could come to a feast as heavy rains threaten the harvest of the European Union's second-largest wheat manufacturer, writes Bloomberg.
This year, it may be the case that weeks of rainfall before harvest can mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry only serves to feed the animals.
"Wheat quality is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 per cent of German wheat can go into animal feed, which is double the standard, estimated in Agrav.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all weather this year.
First the winter was too dry.
It then came a cold spring, which in June was replaced by a heatwave.
Germany was hit by a raid in July, which has continued in August.
Many have their eyes turned on northern Germany, where rain hampers yields.
Only five per cent of wheat has been harvested so far.
Most of the region has not yet started harvesting, local harvest buyer Ceravis reported.
"It's pretty difficult days in hand," said Frank Deckert, senior trader at Ceravis from Rendsburg.
Consistency in everything, or the clever rocks of Finns' interior design
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of fairground homes, as through large windows, the magnificent views of the shores of Saimaa reach many (life) rooms.
Every step of the way, our northern neighbours strive to create both harsh and perfect (energy-saving) homes at the same time.
The knowledge of the timber used by the Finns as construction and finishing materials, furniture and beauty products is worthy of admiration and compliance.
Pedalling keys and smart solutions are found in the fairground by both the builder and (home) designer.
It comes eloquently to the point that the make-up of black, white and grey shadows, if supplemented by wood tones and room plants, can be very moody.
There is still a week to go to pick up the good ideas, as the fair will last until 13 August.
Accessories and pots of herbs suggest that there is often a dock in this kitchen.
On a night out against today, the line was drawn down to this year's Weekend Festival in Balticu, and Martin Garrix gave his all to remember as the last performer.
During the appearance of Garrix, the crowd was truly roaring - singing, hooded, dancing enviably.
Once the Garrix finished, the joint mass of Pärnu beach was spread out to the city.
We bring you to the gallery with all the images that our photographer tried during the three days of the Weekend.
You are certainly some of them too, looking up!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for first time, discuss possible confrontation
Mikey Garcia, of Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are expected to be on a collision course to face up to 66.7 kg in the most attractive boxing match of the immediate future, met for the first time on Thursday.
At ESPN's office in Los Angeles, they were in separate rooms until Garcia, an unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked to the other end of the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's featherweight champion.
Following the victory over Garcia's unanimous decision over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner at Showtime on Saturday, both fighters are among the top five of the weight table.
Garcia stretched his right arm and said: 'How do you go, champion?
I wish you every success.
Lomachenko will defend his belts against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at KL 19 ESPN.
As the pair poached for the photos, Lomachenko's mountain chandelier Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between the militants would be a "perfect measure."
"I am a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up to [63.5 kg] for the Broner, but I am not as big.
I am a small one of 63.5 kg.
I want to move down the lightweight.
And his must move upwards with lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
Fans have wanted it.
Let us offer them that.
Lomachenko agreed.
"The world of boxing needs this fight."
Climas raised the question of whether it should be paid to watch it, as part of its strategy of letting Lomachenko debut in class 61.2 kg later this year to make it possible for a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 notches), who also has an interest in fighting Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbell to win the match after their 23 September lightweight title at Fortune.
"Looking at this fight could be cost-effective as fans have wanted that confrontation," Garcia said, later saying she was open to fighting in any channel offering the best financial package.
"We are the main players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they are prepared...
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko "a mighty fighter" and could go to watch his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was humble in praising Garcia, saying that in his mind the champion of three divisions from Riverside saw out "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted that novelty."
Garcia said the goal was to show the strength of the kick and then to boxing.
Both confirmed that they feel the tension for a power challenge between them is growing.
"It is a struggle that awaits realization.
No other confrontation arouses so much attention and sumina.
I am more than willing to work for it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: 'I have been in the standings for the best fighters and Mikey has just that.
It will be a good fight.
Which of the world corners will be moved to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Protection Agency (PPA) extended and issued a record number of more than 13,000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, when last year's fixed-term residence permit was decided to be issued to 6702 foreigners, the figure was 4928.
The authorities do not know how many immigrants will ultimately remain permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared by the Ministry of the Interior.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a decade ago, in recent years the figure will close to 2000.
The number of people applying for a residence permit increased exponentially during the Ukrainian crisis, with 1087 people receiving a fixed-term residence permit in 2014, 675 a year earlier.
According to the statistical office, the largest number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia came - more than 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia last year than they left.
"The Ukrainian community has been great in Estonia all the time, and due to difficult circumstances in the country it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already ahead," said Kristin Rammus, spokesman for the Interior Ministry.
Last year and last year, the number of people with fixed-term residence permits was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in total the most fixed-term residence permits have been issued for the last ten years.
If the Ukrainians come here mostly to work, Russian citizens will be affected by family migration.
"Given the historic Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, a migration researcher at the Interior Academy.
"If you look at where the Russian citizens who have obtained the Estonian residency permit have moved to, then East Virumaa is right after Harjumaa," he added, and pointed out that about 40 percent of them are married to a European Union citizen.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens were granted a fixed-term residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permit was reduced.
"The hype is due to the fact that, instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been requested for permanent residence in Estonia," explained Rammus, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia's residence permit has remained stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for Estonia permanently.
Its aim is to encourage the cessation of adjusted people.
However, a long-term resident's residence permit requires, for example, five years.
Because of the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit has apparently also declined.
Last year, for example, 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Now the Ukrainians can change their jobs, and the Estonian state is no longer keeping its finger on whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit was popular - applicants for the holders of a grey passport last year (1029), the Russians (487), the Indians (54) and the Nigers (36).
In total, 1968 people were granted a residence permit to settle in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and a similar number of Chinese.
With the first half of this year, the total number of applicants has already reached 1269.
In 10 years, Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When three residence permits were issued to Nigers in 2007, 200 last year.
From Nigeria you are enrolled to study at these universities.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
Indian, Bangladeshi and Nigerian citizens have risen largely thanks to learning mobility.
In their case, too, the rule is that where the community is created in advance, there will be easier access to others, "Rammus added.
In 10 years, two people have moved to Estonia from, for example, North Korea, the same number from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If around 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit per year, that is around 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if the citizens of the European Union are to be counted, migration will be around a percentage, "Maasing commented that the figures are actually small.
In total, 14,822 people migrated to Estonia last year, 13,792 from here.
It means immigration overtook exodus for a second year.
Most of the people moving outside and moving in are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among those leaving.
As a result, the Estonian citizens' migration aldo was in minus 2,000 people last year.
Estonians, in particular, migrate between Finland and Estonia.
Mmlong Couture's Princess simood charms with satside, ponds and collage
However, the bottomless design lady has a history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours somewhere in the museum and admire old sleeves and crawls.
If you are doing something with a passion then you will study and learn more about it every day.
It is a pleasure to discover!
A glamorous world of Mmlong Couture may seem a stranger to some life, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much shine you have in your life!
I have a girlfriend who has a healthy sauna full of haute Couture dresses I created.
Because it is not his fault that he does not live in Hollywood and does not go on a red carpet every day, he also wants to wear these most beautiful dresses, and he will suffer!
You can live your life special!
A fashion artist does not recognise the gap between shining events and grey everyday life.
It was this reasoning that set out the plan to transfer high fashion to rural areas in Estonia, between forests and fields, to people who often do not end up in fashion.
The collection was presented in Võru, Jõhv and Pärnu fashion house, where 45 models of the royal defilee filled the entire street.
Often in Tallinn, hanging is taken in, nodded with dignity, but there is more emotion elsewhere - cries Bravo, stands up, wants to thank you on hand.
Much of the audience came to know, but now they are fans of the Mmlong Couture.
If you exceed people's expectations, they will be spirited!
And I like that feeling like being on the summer tour with my fashion creations.
In Pärnu, we had a 50-metre-long red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful bread, it felt like they were not coming to an end!
Maria also rejects the fashion practice of presenting creations with a supersale supermodel, her memorably bringing ordinary women to the stage.
I often call my own customers on the stage - they have always come with joy.
After all, this is so bet on the experience, you can shine on the stage with a wonderful beautifully held!
I am so sorry that I have never seen my own performance, I am always behind the stage to give the hopeless perfectionist the last muscle to things.
My nerve would not allow calm to be seen from the floor.
Maria is the sort of fashion designer who wants not only to play a representative role, but to be inside everything in hand.
I have a sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection I perform myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, you discover.
I'm never far from my creative and working I'm not afraid.
The design thing is not limited, nor is it stylistics, logistics, organisation - everything has to fit into the day of one temperamental woman.
We will still have a huge amount of fanatics for these working hours.
I can't say when my day of work ends, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I still feel very lucky - it's like a relentless chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and yet turn into compliments.
It has been said many times that there is magic in my dress - they make themselves feel like a princess.
Abundance of gusty sausage lines that made Maria's talent famous overnight, Mlong Couture has remained a signal to this day.
Martin mystery of U18 boys: Albanian gun turned against us now
Sorry, the fairytale ran out.
The first thing that came to mind was that we did not get our table.
And when such a big difference comes in on the table, there's nothing to do, "commented Estonia's U18 basketball boys 61:75 decline to Britain as our only basketball club played in the NBAs, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach Martin myriad.
Opponents took 28 balls from the attacking table and received so many more attacks because of it.
We were also not prepared for their aggressive defence or attack; it created.
Many of the attacks by the Englishmen ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build protection.
In defence, however, they were able to hold hands between everywhere, we could not combine.
It created a team with legs from the bottom.
Opponents "homework was better done.
According to Mürsepa, Estonia had to make more tactical mistakes in order to take the momentum of opponents down in the bud.
Last quarter - we had zero error but opponents already received several quick baskets.
Athleticism and tight insistence, which was our weapon in the underworld tournament, all turned against us now.
Today we had no force against their aggressiveness.
The salesman was satisfied with his negligence in Kalevis, Matthias Tass.
Good words can be said about the whole team in the tournament in general, so far there has been a uniform scoring.
It is a pity that this aggressive opponent had not been met before.
Full time the cup has been self-confident and played the street out of his own but it looked like he was tired - he has borne quite a heavy burden.
But he made some quite a beautiful move that I have seen in the trennies before, 'the supervisor added.
Horrific numbers: In the swans' basketball cone, the EM tournament threw less than 10 points in three quarters...
In the U18 age class, not only did the young men's EMI B division basketball tournament in Tallinn, the swans started in Dublin the day before yesterday.
And the Estonian game with Poland unfortunately fell into the realm of antiRecords.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter, the situation was 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes, opponents took a leg from the gas pedal, and the period remained vivid at 16:16.
In both the first and second quarter, Estonia threw 4, third 1 points...
In doing so, the Estonians hit two pieces of the first throw in the first two minutes, while the forward passed 25 pieces of the game, then one yellow in and then 21 more shots along...
In almost half an hour, one of the 47 sketches was caught.
In addition, 2 points came from four free-throws.
Applications were a reasonable figure at that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had 33 throwing hits and Estonia had 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, Portugal's 83:56 rankings had to be recognised on the opening day.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to supplement supplies
Today, NATO's 1st permanent mine response group arrived in Tallinn for the weekend for a planned port visit to complement the stock of ships and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships prepare to nail to the sea, thereby giving crew members the opportunity to take a few days' leave.
Following the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to conduct a series of exercises and be ready for future historical explosive search operations.
"Estonians" involvement in the NATO unit and their co-operation in local waters well illustrates our integration with the allied forces, "said Arto Reinmaa, chief operating and planning officer of the Navy's fleet commander.
Since 29 June, NATO will lead the 1st permanent mine group, the Latvian navy captain Gvido Laudups, who took over the task of group leader at the ceremony held in Riga from the Estonian naval officer, Captain Johan-Elias of Seljamaa.
The Latvian naval support vessel LVNS in Virsaii, which also operates the group's steering staple, has been designated as the group's flagship ship.
This semester, the Estonian navy minemaker Sakala will be part of the international unit.
As one of the four groups of ships under NATO's naval command, NATO's 1st permanent mine relief group is a ready-made unit that the alliance can send to different parts of the world within five days.
Between 4 and 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become the site of the Birgitta Festival, which was launched 13 years ago by Maestro Eri Klass.
This year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to Risto Joseph (36), the artistic leader of the Tallinn Philharmonic.
Risto Joost: The listeners are reached by "Traviata" and "Tosca," the ballet answers from the fascinating "Boleros" amusing "Karlsson," and neither is the self-production of the plan, this time the seasons of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorium, the same international creative team that brought the Pharmatory to Hayd in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatrical performances.
It's bigger than any music theatre in its usual form.
It is a festival whose snowflakes take hold and never quite unravel again.
Because the experience that a listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes the human souls sound and touches the human perception in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic leader of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't the shoes of maestro Eri Klass feel a bit big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it has been a lot of help.
He channelled me through my entire student career and also supported a dirigeing career at the start.
Perhaps it is thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue his work.
A team at the Birgitta Festival has been injected with so much kindness by different Klas and, of course, it all spills over to me as well.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things are going.
It was the great heart of Eri Klass that gave me the strength to make good progress with the Birgitta Festival at the Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am and I can manage!
What could excite audiences at this year's festival, what special do you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, by surprise, the presentation will be the first ballet, written to Astrid Lindgren's narrative.
That is what "Karlsson is flying."
And one of the notorious nuances of this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed his desire to write this work.
He probably has a Karlsson caracter who has already lived in the breath of a child since then.
Risto, how do you keep it all cool?
Thanks to my supportive partner certainly.
This kind of work requires a support system and a lot of love, and that is, thankfully, what I have in mind.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions aren't so much dependent on other people, as far as I am myself, maybe how I go against every new day.
And such conscious holding back on tone, keeping positivity and actually smiling into myself in the mirror of the mornings, greatly raised my happiness percentage.
Especially now this week, when the most important samples are, I have been particularly keen to practice it and it works.
Giving yourself a smile activates the brain and raises the tone.
It is not just a buzzword.
I do not think that people know yet half the things about their body that the universe offers them, but if everyone discovers it slowly.
Now, it is an important moment.
Have you some ritual before entering the conductor's wedding?
It is still, clothes need to be replaced against more comfortable ones.
It is this little moment for yourself.
But generally yes, I don't have the chance to rest or make a small shark before making a big appearance.
In fact, I even like to engage actively with people, even before I step into the dirigendipulti.
But come all to the Birgitta Festival, here's what to discover for not a particularly great opera and ballet friend too!
Watch the moody video with Risto Joseph!
New findings of age assessment tests for asylum seekers in Sweden were published
The latest results of the test show that more than 80% of the tested patients were rated older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
Sweden's National Institute for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started tests earlier this year.
Tests were set up to assess the age more accurately in the course of asylum applications after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of several allegedly underage refugees.
By now, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to testing, and the Institute for Attorney General has released a total of 2,481 test results between mid-March and July 31, between now and July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were assessed as aged 18 or older and in 25 other cases, the Institute for forensic Medicine estimated that Testiva "could be 18 years old or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person was "presumably younger than 18."
Tests will only be used if the age of the person is under question.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of forensic Medicine, the results are consistent compared with those in the previous months.
"We don't see a big difference compared to the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
Having a large proportion of the cases assessed older than 18 does not necessarily mean asylum applicants have lied about their age.
Institute released the findings of the 581 test in May and said there were "indications in 442 cases that the person under investigation is 18 years old or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of their 581 test, it turned out that in 243 cases a person had directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, which takes X-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRT from knee joints, after which they are allowed to be analysed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some quarters.
One of the skeptics is the endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, Claude Marcus, whose duties include evaluating people's biological maturity to find out whether they passed puberty sooner or later.
'i've had reason to think about it and I don't think the method of measuring used right now should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, then we shouldn't make a face that we can, "he told the newspaper Metro.
But Johan Göransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "Overall, the risk of dissolving a child inaccurately into an adult is low.
The biggest risk, at around 10%, is when the person is just under 18.

Anna Maria Orel, a 20-year-old left-hander, made a beautiful debut at the London Mil with a stunning 18th place in 67.37ga.
Organ was the MM's youngest female vassist, and a cheerful woman confirmed she hopes to fight for the medals in the future.
The contest went well and got a good experience.
In the first test (64.80) I made my average score straight away; in the second (62.80) I risked too much and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear, "Orel said after the contest.
I was looking for my emissions and I am very glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's MM debut ended with a sterling 18th place.
The rainfall did not blend, because it is training through the winter at the Stadium of TUT.
"I am hardened," he said with a little mum.
London's Olympic stadium had a near-full house section of the nation, did Orel beat people around him or manage to turn themselves off?
I perceived, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it gives more - that is it!
If you compete yourself, you can experience it.
The organ confirmed that it is satisfied with the MM's debut and that there are many good competitions ahead of him: "I came here for 32nd of this season, with the last result, I finished in 18th place.
This is a very decent result.
I am 20 years old and MMil - that is the only thing that matters.
I take with me a good experience and some days I want to compete for medals already.
Governor of West Virgina announced party change
Jim Justice, the Democrat governor of West Virginia, announced Thursday night at a gathering with President Trump that he would change the party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I say to you, having prayed and thought hard... today I say to you, the West Virginia, that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor."
During the gathering there were rumors of joy.
"So I will be a Republican tomorrow," Mr Justice added.
"As a Treer, I would say to you that it is time to play another game."
Trump had promised a major announcement earlier at a gathering in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbesi, turned out to be elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and the coal business pretty much includes him from his father.
Its value is approximately USD 1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued an announcement Thursday night that "Governor Justice's party exchange is another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather prevent the country from getting better again than work for it."
"Just 15 governors and control over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent wake-up call to a party that is out of touch to the end and unable to find a positive and unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
It is no surprise that, where there are many people, there are also many injured.
Urmet, who is serving on medical records at weekend, told The Independent yesterday that the patches have had to share quite a lot of it.
Whistles and berries are basic, out-twisted and light-dropping.
Of course, the main, the back and the shoes.
According to Urmeti, visitors come to the festival with false footwear and so the problems will come.
Medics have also had to assist visitors with a pair of more injuries - there have been some panic attacks as well as one foothold.
We have also made stitches when a person has had his hand or finger shattered.
The smaller seams do away here, the larger we send to the hospital.
Watch the video to see if the festive media are asking for a painkiller to treat the pommell.
Coe praised Russians' honest apology for doping scandal
Athletics international ninamees Sebastian Coe, according to him, praised "Russia's honest apology Thursday" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country back into sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, the Russian athletics' nominee, told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the athletics World Cup that his state-imposed ban on the competition was correct and has a firm target of fighting doping.
He apologised "to all athletics classes who have been snatched away by gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to keep the ban on competition in force, which was introduced in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think today was a very honest response, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told journalists.
"The entire council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian subunion itself also acknowledged that they have had quite difficult times and are doing everything they can to restructure the Alliance."
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted criteria for its own reinstatement.
"I believe there was a very constructive day today and there is progress going on, but Congress will support the group's proposal that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia," Coe said.
"We must do everything we can in the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from a broken system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletics players who meet strict criteria at the IAAF will compete as neutral athletes at the World athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
Head of the IAAF working group Rune Andersen said Monday that Russia is yet to meet several criteria for reinstatement.
After a briefing to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that doping checks were still insufficient and that the coaches who received the ban were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution will significantly change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only does the electric car revolution significantly change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mining giants like Glencore can say they win from one place and lose from the other, smaller mining firms do not help.
Glencore currently earns from coal and oil but will continue to grow demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel in the era of electric cars.
This year, decisions by the governments of the UK, France and Norway, which promise to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels, have raised the stakes on the spread of electric cars.
A sestap has already known Volvo is planning to abandon an internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring a cheaper Model 3 electric car onto the market.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, more electric cars are already being sold over two decades than fuel-powered cars produced from oil.
"In terms of some metals, it will change everything," said Simona Gambranini, a commodity analyst at Capital Economics, told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has been increasing for years.
Electric cars have about three times more copper than conventional cars, Glencore reported.
Even more cops are needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates it will increase copper demand by about five per cent by 2025.
An increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will benefit from a growing electric car trend from copper price rises and being the world's largest cobalt manufacturer, the Jefferies Group estimated.
Its broker company estimates that other electric car race winners will be Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is reacting to a trend that is already changing.
This year, 70 per cent of the London metal stock market has shrunk.
Last year's price rise was 37 per cent.
Copper has also climbed 14 per cent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's share price rose 20 per cent in London, having outperformed rivals Rio tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American from price rises.
On the losing side, lead companies like Recyclex and Campine have to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of lead is the batteries supplied by the flow of petrol and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"It is a serious risk to lead demand unless another purpose is found for it to overcome the fall in demand," said Michael Widmer, head of analyst at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch's metal market.
The lead price movement has yet to notice the impact of the trend.
Lead has climbed 17 per cent this year, with the best metal among the main industrial metals in London from price rises.
Investors are seeing problems on metal only far into the future.
"I'm not sure the lead is so bad because cheap oil keeps conventional cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at metal broker Triland Metals.
If lead demand falls, it happens slowly.
It may be that will happen in about a decade.
In the meantime, tougher emissions standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which rely on lead-based batteries developed during frequent engine launch, is being assessed by the international lead and zinc research organisation.
Lightweight metals such as aluminium replace steel as a lighter car can drive less electricity further away.
This explains the lower minimum demand of an additional 1.6 million tonnes between 2013 and 2016.
It accounts for 2.7 per cent of the total production of aluminium in the world.
Probably this trend is getting worse, said Widmer.
Aluminium has climbed 13 per cent this year as rising demand from carmakers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers are not sleeping.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce tiny car kerets.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also looking to develop a lighter melting steel to withstand the lower minimum.
"A super-strong steel should be the answer to this development," said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There is some success in Europe.
An end to the oil era could also bring suffering to the platinum.
It took about half of that precious metal to catalyse cars with diesel engines last year, metal refiner Johnson Matthen reported.
"Many current high-demand commodities like oil and platinum may not have high demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, a commodity analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Platinum producers believe continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, head of Uncore, said more hybrid cars would continue to be sold in 2025.
A great hope for platinum producers in the 10-year term is for hydrogen-based cars based on a hydrogen cell developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos, which depend on the platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
Until now, however, this technology has not yet commercially justified itself.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the way to electric cars," Exane told BNP Paris Brunet.
German automakers suffered a major setback in July as Stuttgart Court banned diesel use in the hometown of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing the rampant spending of European football clubs will not prevent Neymar's world-record transfer from Spanish football club Barcelona to French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences for UEFA, the governing body that reigns the European game and has the power to ban teams from attending the prestigious Champions League tournament, are still waiting for Paris Saint-Gerpi.
Financial rules for fair play introduced by UEFA in 2011 (FFP) mean PSG will have to prove sometime that Neymar's transition was funded without a huge loss.
Barcelona was paid $222 million ($262 million) alone for buying the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar's salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's transition to the French club.
It will undoubtedly be possible for PSG to get Neymar recruited and put such money into their star-studded ranks, given that the team is being funded by the family from Qatar's energy squad.
Clubs are allowed to spend plenty of money on recruiting players but need to balance it with legal sources of income allowing them to come up with their own in the football business.
FFP was tipped by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
A former French player believed that clubs who fall into big debts in search of success were actually engaged in cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners were to give up support.
From 2011, the FFP will focus on tracking their losses instead of the debts of clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 at Chelsea - to buy a club with potential and then to spend heavily on making the team better and creating a global brand - will be harder to implement.
During the FFP's current three-year evaluation period, which runs until 2018, clubs could incur losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini being shamelessly ousted from the presidential office in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen those rules," Andrea Traverso, an FFP monitor at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid for Neymar's overpurchase clause as a single full payout, it is possible for them to split that amount into lots for accounting purposes throughout the period of validity of the agreement.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, making it possible to show the transfer fee as an amount of EUR 44.4 million per year over the next five years.
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with Manchester City belonging to Abu Dhabi, suffered the most severe penalties.
A penalty of €60 million was awarded to PSG (at that point $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million, and the club was ordered to restrict the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that may try to roam over regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their incomes through companies linked to the club's owners.
A Qatar company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSG support from the Qatar Tourism Authority was inflated.
It has been said that a certain portion of Neymar's PSG service could come from Qatar through payments from the 2022 World Cup organising committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny Neymar could become ambassador for the World Cup and argue that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a maneuver.
Penalties previously imposed on PSG mean UEFA will be even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to bypass the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not preemptively discussed Neymar's transition with PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed, as they are not allowed to discuss PSG's situation.
The latest reports show that PSG made a profit of more than €10 million over the 2015-2016 season, with a turnover of around €542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
Mr PSG hopes Neymar's arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship deals, merchandise and spinning.
The club expects a turnover of at least 30 per cent in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
In a clear upset over the departure of one of the biggest football stars, the Spanish league tried to block Neymar's transition by claiming PSG were in breach of the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the country," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to PSG being mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's stance that the country funds the club.
"It is a consequence of ownership and it has completely changed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"If a club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of the fair game, as a country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a great player.

50 years ago today: A storm of hurricane relief in Estonia that tore roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane, which was called the storm of the century, raged on 6 and 7 August, caused major damage especially to the West, Harjumaa and Raplamaa.
During those days in northwestern Estonia, wind speeds were more than 30 m/s.
My old man ran in the garden from one of the cupboard trees to another, and the coverage with his hands to support them.
Everything was dark and in rugby, like a world stop.
Roofs were already flown from the houses, the grandmother of Haapsalu, Linda Kurova, in 2002 reminded Estonia's nature in an interview with the magazine.
Linda's husband saw how the garden he had planted himself collapsed.
But what are you still wooden with your hands supporting where do you get against such a storm?
The sea came down the window, water sprayed from the windows, "Mrs Linda, who lived in Kalda Street in Haapsalu, spoke at the time.
Because the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station's perron had flown 20 to 30 feet away, Linda saw most of the haapsaluls in a similar way only the next morning.
According to locals, the trees behind Paralepa were lying on the ground, some completely lying, some in half.
Everyone looked very frustrating, the storm went through the beautiful old trees with rugby and ferry like war.
West Virumaa was not particularly badly affected by the August 1967 storm compared to Western Estonia, but the losses were large there, the Virumaa Journal wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Lossipark and Padise Park were swept from the ground, but our Khanty Parks were also badly damaged.
In Tallinn, wind speeds were measured up to 35 metres per second, about 130 kilometres per hour.
At Merifield in Tallinn on the evening of August 6.August, one of the tiny penctirts cried: 'Mother, mother!
Chickens are in the air and can no longer get down!, "wrote the Virumaa Journal.
The Põhl manor building in Viljandial was destroyed by the storm to the extent that it was decided to be demolished later.
The August storm did not receive the construction of the Düri ski mountain, which was no longer restored.
On 12 August 1967, the Red District newspaper wrote that cleaning up cities and settlements from grazed trees and their branches was slow to progress, and residents could swap on the clean-up.
Fertility fields were also badly affected by the storm, and the newspaper reported that "party primary organizations must be both an upkeep and a grain-strapped inspirer and a guideline."
Hurricanes can be talked about in cases where the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record for wind gusts in Estonia will last from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul was measured at 48 m for wind speed.
The island of Vaindloo was crushed by a meter, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
Fury of clean bathing areas: Night-time clean-up and poor beach weather
The colder summer weather also means a smaller cleaning effort in the bathing areas of Tallinn.
"If there is a weather, there are people on the beach, and if there is no, there are no people," says the corner of the beach.
Cataracts are preying on the beach of Northern Tallinn's Stroom.
For them, a tractor bouncing on low turtles offers a melodic competition, ploughing off stripes to the plate.
In fact, the last one sits through the sand at depths of seven centimetres, picking out sea litter and the risk left behind by humans: Wooden orchards, cigarette cages and more.
Humans still come to the beach, regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If there is beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if not there are no people, "says Aleksandr Usov, head of cleaning works at the beach at the Private Company's Haabersti Administration.
It is 6.30pm and there is a bitter clean-up on the beach as at eight o'clock it must be OK for people.
Usov is already on the operating post at 4 a.m.
Apart from Stroom, he is still keeping an eye on the beach of Pirita, Harku Lake, Cakumu and Paljasaare Pikakari.
The volume of Prüm has decreased.
Years ago it was much more so.
Now people can already appreciate what is being done for them, "says Usov, who has picked up the wrist for 15 years.
It was the case earlier that when something new was upright, it was broken the next day.
Now what is on the beach is already being held.
Clean beach price
One of the biggest works in Estonian beaches is cleaning up sea debris, or adru.
A beach in Pirita, for example, has to be dragged away for this coastal season by 400,000 tonnes.
"It is an incredible amount," notes Usov.
The second large category is urban garbage, all that people leave behind.
A half-kilometre Stroom beach bar has eight large rubbish containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
So much will be rubbish.
However, the colder summer weather has meant the debris is a fifth less than otherwise.
A third species is the abandoned stuff.
Most of the time, these are children's lives.
As a sov from inside the sand, Usov has scooped a dozen model cars.
These will be left to the owners to wait for the wooden road on the beach.
"They usually come out more, but it is a normal harvest." Usov already knows that soon he will find them again from inside the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
Debris scrapped
Erika Scholler, a Haabert administrative services representative, admits that the tractor's screening work is troubling locals.
A noise that runs from the early hours of the night to the early morning mixes the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
On the day, however, this work is impossible.
In one six, the beach has to be driven twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," Scholler notes.
But the aim, like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu, is to get the Stroom beach under the hallmark of the international sine flag.
"Compared to Europe, there is a lot more work in Estonia to have beaches maintained," says Scholler.
We have more adru and stones and harder to drive sand.
However, there is less rubbish in our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Hearing that the beach is talking about rubbish, Martin, who lives near Stroom beach, is unforced to enter a chat circle of journalists and cleaners, highlighting the current bottleneck of the beach.
In the mornings, there is a picture of the balcony everywhere.
It's a problem with the birds and the wooden slaves who have pulled rubbish bags on the thunder, "reports Martin.
Although it's hard to expect people to be able to change their behaviour to date, Martin hopes the town hall will take action with rubbish bins and, for example, impose a crane on them, at least to stop the birds in the news going on there.
Overall, however, Martin is happy with the development of the Stroom beach.
It is seen that the city is taking care of that.
It has become more pleasant with children's squares, illuminated and freshly asphalt roads.
It was once the case that the roller coasters were only able to ride one way, "notes Martin.
Aardehunt's findings in Stroom: Coins, only coins
The morning spanning period has been used by the 40-year-old Dimitri, who, as a treasure hunter, is combing the beach with a metal detector.
He does not think he will find anything valuable today or in the future.
Marine gods are not generous enough to do so.
"I have been dealing with this for a year and have not found anything valuable so far," reports Dmitry.
As a cabaret hunter, there are a few euro coins, bottle towers in Dmitry's treasure bag, as well as dangerous pounds that will later throw in the trash.
Normally there are still coins.
"Gold, fingers and the like are usually not," the treasure hunter states.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at their former level as weak economic growth and inflationary easing have softened speculation of a rise.
Bank of England has warned that growth will remain sluggish as squeezing household incomes have put interest rates on hold.
Bank Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers voted to keep 6:2 rates at 0.25 percent, and fewer members are calling for a rise this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7 per cent and its 1.6 per cent for 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes would remain as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank also signalled that rate growth would be necessary to curb Brexit-fuelled inflation over the next few years, and a higher-than-expected rise in borrowing costs could be needed in financial markets.
Members also voted to partly withdraw the mammoth package that fuelled the economy a year ago as a result of Brexit.
It will end its fixed-term funding scheme in February, which offers cheap finance to banks, though said it now expects a 15 billion-pound increase in supply under the scheme, which is GBP 115 billion.
In minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says: "In the interim forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption."
On rates, it was reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" was needed to mitigate inflation, and "somewhat larger" than expected on the markets.
Börs is currently predicting a first rise in the third quarter of next year and a second increase in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any jumping would be gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to those for May at 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast of 1.8% growth for 2018 remained.
After that news, the pound fell in line with the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make any changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened growing hopes of an upward increase in GDP of Gauzès in the second quarter, rising from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, according to the bank, although it will start gaining some momentum at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation report gave little reason to cheer on rising inflation and woeful pay rises for households, saying the situation was going a little worse before improving.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent earnings hitting in the next few years, but a marked recovery in wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Because of the weak pound, the economy is also spurred by growing demand for British produce, which in part compensates for lower consumer spending.
A decision comes a year after rates were moved to 0.25 per cent last August following a shocking EU referendum that caused the pound to decline suddenly.
It is likely to take four years for prices and the economy to breathe full into life, according to the bank.
Ahead of the Bank's latest decision, there was a growing demand for rate increases as inflation had increased pressure on hard-pressed households; in July, three policymakers called for a rate increase of 0.5 per cent.
Inflation fell 2.6 per cent last month compared to 2.9 per cent in June, although the bank said it was expected and there will be a rise again in the coming months.
However, the bank said the excessive growth compared to the 2 per cent target was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of mortgage brokers at Coreco, said: "Given the recent downturn in exchange rates, it looks like the mortgage market is once again becoming increasingly competitive as lenders crave work and hope to finish the year positively.
Boosters seem particularly favorable for those whose current deals start to come to an end as refinancing, often at no service fee and low rates, has become increasingly popular.
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV medication for 10,000 people
Patients have access to "transformative" HIV preventive treatment since September after a battle struck down in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England reported that state healthcare now makes an estimated 10,000 people available for pre-exposure prophylactics (prep) - a tablet administered before the altercation, which has shown a reduction in the risk of infection in high-risk people by about 86 per cent during the initial three-year clinical trial.
NHS agreed to fund a clinical trial after the appeals court upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS was able to pay for a prep, despite the agency's own claims that the drug should instead be funded by local authorities.
NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens welcomed the move unveiled on Thursday as a "new massive intervention," while the National AIDS Foundation (NAT) described it as a "pivotal moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. Further clinics will be added in October before the programme is introduced across England by April 2018.
A pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) is a disease of HIV drugs, taken before the altercation, to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Clinical trial results show that prep significantly reduces transmission of HIV among people with infection risk.
Taking prep before the intercourse means that there are sufficient medicines in the human body that prevent HIV from becoming infected.
Such medications can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the break.
Suitable candidates for treatment include LGBT men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment.
Clinicians identify suitable people willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-related partner does not receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their wish to participate in the local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
It will cost GBP 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to get the drugs available this week after an international procurement procedure.
A clinical trial is designed to gauge the true potential of the prep by gathering clinical evidence of who the drug is intended for and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture.
Mr Stevens said: "This new wide-ranging intervention should complement and leverage the widespread and increasingly successful fight against HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of fighting one of humanity's greatest health problems.
Deborah Gold, NAT's chief executive, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
A prep if targeted correctly at those who need it and belong to a risk group offers the opportunity to change England's HIV epidemic.
From September, people with high HIV risk in England through this NHS-funded clinical test have access to a powerful new tool that is individually manageable and does not depend on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The priority now is to ensure that the clinical trial across the country is swiftly set in motion and that none of the members of the HIV risk group remain sidelined.
Now that the prep clinical trial drug has been sourced, we are on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of being infected with HIV.
Shadow Minister for Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the prep clinical trial is a very welcome and well-delayed one after months of delays and slack in the Government's legs.
Evidence shows how much change this drug could bring to HIV prevention work and end the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us a step closer to fully understanding the prep benefits.
Now it's important that the clinical trial is introduced across the country as soon as possible to protect people who have exposure to HIV and take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society.
The price of electricity in Estonia rose by 12%, while in Latvia and Lithuania the price of electricity decreased.
In July, the difference in the next day's electricity exchange price between the price areas of Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.94, compared to EUR 7.71 in June this year, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price difference is the wealth of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia, the average exchange price for electricity was EUR 34.33 per megawatt hour last month, and the price increased by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per Megawatt hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17, and the system price of the Nord Pool power exchange was EUR 26.37 per megawatt hour.
Prices rose 12 and seven per cent respectively.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Finland for 75% of the hours of last month from Estonia and 16% of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
Of the remaining nine per cent of hours between the two countries, next day's deals did not take place.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Latvia 99% of the time from Estonia to Latvia, and 73% of the hours used total transmission capacity.
In the NASDAQ OMX market on the last trading day of July, the electricity exchange price could be about 34 euros a megawatt hour in August and 37 euros per megawatt hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affects the production price of electricity, increased last month and the transactions took place at a price of between EUR 5.04 and 5.47 per tonne.
Living in a high life - a half-storey and smart design trench has turned this small Earls Court apartment into a home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator, exchanged her large Knightsbridge home in 2014 against the Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and that Joanne has not packed her bags together and sold her apartment further is a tribute to the new design.
'Before that, I lived with a former partner in Knightsbridge on a much bigger surface, 'Joanne said.
"I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offer.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and had similar high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day.
From the first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a complete innovation curve.
At first it was a one-bedroom and complex layout flat - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a half-floor to take advantage of high ceilings.
'i wanted high ceilings, large windows, a lot of light.
These were my demands, "he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed in Notting Hill to take advantage of 3.8m height ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development item but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so there was an architectural challenge to create a semi-floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to approach the thing creatively.
"Metal construction is quite complex," he explains.
'We had to reorganise the premises so they were positioned on top of each other without bowing down.
It wasn't just about building a platform, but we used steel construction to get the height of both the upper and lower spaces right.
This position enabled Erfanil to create two full-height rooms in a room with plenty of dramatic elements.
A glamorous dwelling beneath the view of the window of Retrouvius opens from the semi-floor.
Headlined with golden furniture, silver detail and a retro-splattered Serge Mouille luminaire accentuate the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatrical, space and light saturation.
Mirrors have been added to both ends of the short corridor to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, a back wall with a mirror leaves the impression of another room opening window.
At the entrance, the mirror captain offers a deposit for all of Joanne's dining tools and glass requirements.
For the living room, the charm adds a way to close the kitchen if it is not used, generating the image from a more glamorous space.
Folding kitchens is nothing new.
However, the fact that this is a garage-type, upscale door is unique to this kitchen.
"A bit of design effort went into it," Erfan explains the door spotted on the MDF with steel strengthening.
'It has a counterweight, which is why it slipped very easily when it gets pushed up.
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra beds, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"At the end of the day, the floor area is what you sell - or what gives the property value," says Erfan.
'a real estate agent enters a room in an out-of-date form and makes calculations based on the area of the floor.
Here, they have managed to increase floor space while using high-quality materials that add luxury to space.
"Materials are the ones you tap and thereby help create an emotional bond with your home," says Erfan.
'You do not fall in love with the electricity cable that is on the wall.
It is important, but it does not make the heart look at the languages.
It shows that good design and magnified surface area help make a pretty ordinary flat something amazing.
In fact, they can even cause a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
Chief Dane Jensen is a Chicago-based skyscraper who competes with a colleague for a career elevation.
No matter the amount of money other than earned, beside which any ethics forgets.
His wife and three children are seen by a man only in the early hours of the morning and late at night.
In the first half of the film, I find myself thinking that this is a version of the business world of the "House of Cards" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speaking mansion is similar.
However, the film goes on, the less an element of the cabaret, and the moralising intent of the filmmakers is becoming more and more apparent.
A life-changing experience will be for the protagonist son to develop cancer.
A choice must now be made between work and family life.
An architect's dreaded son puts his father on walks to Chicago's big buildings to think about really important things like faith, kindness, love... without even touching the disaster of the twin towers.
After the third scene in which the son opens his father's eyes, there is a sense that the filmmakers have approached the goal of getting the audience to surely cry, as even the most belly-hearted viewer can't hold back tears from seeing the suffering of a beloved cancer-stricken boy.
If the son falls into the coma and his situation seems hopeless, the father will finally understand the morality of his work and make the old man looking for the work of the charity.
Now I bet on myself in terms of myself - if the film has a happy end, I prey on my perceptibility after the movie's coffee, if I'm wrong, then the scene star can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there is a suspicion that the iceberg will miss the coffee - when the husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man rushes in slow motion along the corridor towards the palate.
But the son has instead healed miraculously, and although his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can also feel good about myself - I can already quite predict the end of the American drama!
In fact, the film is well constructed, all the necessary elements are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the morals beautiful: Money is not the most important thing in life.
It probably brings the film well in.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media intake.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it in real terms.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the new chief of staff at the White House plans to limit the flow of information reaching President Trump, including news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in a softer water.
Here's a split from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"As the White House's new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, got together with high officials on his first day in office, he outlined a key problem for President Donald trump in the White House, which he planned to fix poor information reaching into the president's hands.
Kelly told officials that the information had to move through him, whether on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he were shared good information.
Kelly's diagnosis seems entirely logical, but others have attempted it too, and they have failed to track down a trump tattoo with his media consumption.
As president trump's relationship with television stretches back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his television viewing habits have gone nowhere.
"If candidate Trump was upset about dishonest media coverage, it paid to show him that he was also fairly reflected in the publications being impacted," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "according to six former campaign employees, the key to managing Trump's Twitter habits is to make sure that his personal media consumption includes, in a stable way, praises as well."
Good.
But the idea that the habits of Trump's Twitter use have ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaigners know something that the rest of us do not know that the drum springs would have been even more incendiary without these interventions.
We will probably never find out about the sleeves that Trump did not post.
If his helpers were able to save him from mischief a few times, their exertions were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from systematically creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of competing clicks, people are exclusively trying to promote their own interests by passing on material to Trump that supports their worldviews but may not always be credible.
Politico, which echoes the progress of the entire story, wrote in May about advisers' tendency to feed information of strategically questionable value to the president.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Current and former Trump subordinates say Trump can respond to the negative press, particularly with damaging effects on leaflets, with exploits taking hold on identifying their source.
It also happened at the end of February, when someone disappointingly gave the president a printed copy of an article by internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, GotNews.com, a website that accused the deputy chief of staff, Katie Walsh, of being the "source of a series of leaflets" at the White House.
Never mind that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter due to mocking or that he offered no specific evidence or that he has also made false accusations in the past and withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and began to inherit Walsh from the subordinate.
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House office chief Rob Porter "have tried to introduce a system to manage and document documents reaching Trump."
How did it succeed?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his helpers are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians who come to the capital from abroad will not be able to obtain permission to appear bitterly.
Many foreigners are being kissed in Tallinn city centre.
Those with whom the fire broke out confessed to playing in the Old City without the permission of the town hall.
We first found three street musicians near the gates of Viru who had taken the same number of dogs with them.
It was clearly seen that musicians with rastapisses and fractured clothes were backpackers who would wear one shower berry.
Despite the appearance, the company's only woman played a story with an amusing rhythm on the accordion, while one man gestured alongside her three balls in a juggle and called the passing closer.
A third man had sat next to them in a backpack and smoked a heartbeat of himself ready-turned plywood.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing people.
Bob, who has been playing the actress with Noemi and balls, spoke of kissing the streets for fun as well as money.
The aim of the event was to collect ticket money for a ship travelling to Finland on the night of the same day.
Asked about the question of whether they asked for permission from the city for kissing in the old town, Noemi and Bob shook their heads.
Firstly, we did not know.
Secondly, we never last in one city for more than a day or a couple, and most of the time permits are granted or something like that for a month.
It makes no sense to pay for it, 'Bob explained.
As we got back to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw two women being with musicians and chasing them away.
The group moved backpackers and dogs to the crossroads of Viru Centre to try their luck.
There were also three Polish young men on Viru Street, one of whom played the violin, the other a clarney, and the third had even carried the electronic piano along.
"We are here to entertain people to spread music and joy and make money for fuel and living," explained the trio pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that there must be permission from the city administration for a presence.
'Of course we don't have that, 'he said while joking.
But we hope that when people enjoy our music, there's no problem.
Obviously when the police come we go elsewhere but we have to try, 'he added.
The Bank of Estonia bought bonds in July for EUR 149 million under the public asset purchase programme of the euro area central banks, while the central bank bond portfolio grew to a total of EUR 4.36 billion.
The Central Bank does not disclose more detailed information on purchases.
Hardo HANSSON, the President of the Estonian bank, has previously explained in response to a question from the members of the national assembly that the purchase plan for the central banks of the Eurosystem includes three different purchase programmes: Covered bonds in the financial sector (covered bonds), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The Central Bank is buying up bonds on the market to encourage investors who have sold bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Lower risk asset yield falls as a result of purchases, and this motivates investors to take bigger risks.
As a rule, under the public bond buying programme, each central bank buys its national government bonds, other national bonds are not bought.
As the Estonian state has not issued the bonds, the Bank of Estonia will make so-called "replacement purchases" within the volume allocated to them.
Central banks also shop around in those countries where bond yields on the purchase plan are limited.
The Bank of Estonia generally buys the bonds of the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank, following Hansson's confirmation.
The Bank of Estonia will purchase bonds under the asset purchase programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering also received bonds, but in June 2016 the Bank of Estonia would no longer purchase Elering's bonds.
On behalf of the euro area central banks, the Finnish central bank will buy both Elering and Eesti Energy bonds from June onwards.
Migraines ignore ditch and return to 'millionai'
Once again, some of the West Midlands's wealthiest homeowners have been caught up in a fierce confrontation with determined migraines who have ignored the council's excavated ditch to win back the field away from their villains.
Migraines have parted their 20 caravan fields into a prosperous "millionaire runway" near the christened Solihull street.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks after they were only kicked out of it in May without allowing themselves to be mixed with a ditch dug by the council to block their invasion.
An activist group found a weak spot on defensive limits, squeezing its vehicles through an unblocked section that had been left on foot.
Furious residents have axed Solihull council, saying the council is "useless in dealing with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after they were ousted from Bentley Heath, where they dragged passing stoners.
Councillors need to be shamed for going into action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, they were driven away and now they are back again.
They came last night, probably more today.
He added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with such things by sourcing long barriers to protect their parks.
I live in Streetsbrook Road and I am not satisfied that I must continue to pay council tax if the council cannot even prevent such a thing.
A local resident, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: "This is ridiculous. We have only seen how the last of these warriors left, and a new offensive is already under way.
This time the number has increased and the grasshopper has even been seen remembering the horse.
A spokesman for Solihull Council said: "We are aware that the land near the Streetsbrook Road is an unacceptable camp site, and we are working with the Solihull police. We are taking the necessary legal action to get them moving as quickly as possible.
Gathering evidence is very helpful when as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to police, calling Number 101.
It helps to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them.
The Weekend Festival is visited by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, among others, who is pleased that Estonia has managed to bring real top names to the world.
Asked why the Weekend festival is so important to Estonians, Saar says that it should be asked of all those who fully enjoy the festival's three-day jutt.
But he says that the true actors of his field have arrived in Pärnu.
"Looking at this level of artists that has been brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre are brought home - this often does not happen in our fold," the Minister for Culture says.
What kind of artists at the festival, however, are the islands themselves the most talked about?
I find myself relatively old-fashioned, and for the old people of my faith, surely one of the most experienced artist, Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
According to his record, at some point, all of us have complicated ourselves, "he says.
But he does bring out several more names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian players too: Starting with NOŁP and they can be read in a whole series.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high, "he says.

Audi revamps up to 50,000 diesel vehicles amid criticism from automakers
A day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it was offering a software application for more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the BMW chairman, the company believes there are "smarter options than driving restrictions," citing European cities including the BMW home city of Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it will renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engine emissions.
No company described these actions as a recall.
European carmakers have advertised eagerly in Europe and the United States for the use of diesel vehicles to help comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of the equipment to neutralise the emissions emitted by diesel vehicles will increase for the automotive industry, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German carmakers are under close investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of cherry-picking powerful car manufacturers and ignoring signs pointing to the problem.
Companies are trying to prevent a repeat of Volkswagen's mistakes, who quieted the use of so-called "beatings" that allowed adapting exhaust faces to the regulations by the time the car was tested, but pulled back in normal driving conditions.
Multiple Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics subunit of the Audi engine development department in Germany was arrested.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and can go to trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was pulled into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany after authorities accused the Audit of installing a system to evade European requirements for exhaust gas, thereby extending an investigation that had focused on the United States previously.
Audi's involvement in the investigation could be a major blow to Volkswagen, the manufacturer of VET luxury cars generating disproportionately much of Volkswagen's profits.
European Union flags are being purchased for Estonian schools for EUR 20,000.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags to Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
In total, 570 educational institutions will receive the EU flag with measurements of 105x158 centimetres.
Flags are intended to be exhibited indoors; they must be carried out in high-quality printed techniques indoors with an indoor fixture, interferes with the ERR news portal.
The Lipuvarda label contains the text: "A gift to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union in Estonia.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20,000 on the price of the Ministry of Education, or EUR 35 per flag.
Journalist's murder highlights growing threat in Mexico
Employees of the week-long Riodoce typically gather on Wednesday to review plans for the most recent chaos in Sinaloa state soared by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They are told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior writers will discuss which looks safer: Either bring the children with them to an office that was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words to the board at the head of the room: 'Enemies', 'neutral', 'Allies'.
They ask reporters to provide the names of each column with no evidence needed, enough impressions and an internal feeling.
Drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being employed by the government or by cartels, of having a whole list of bad people who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
There is no break from violence, and the more bodies are accumulated across the country, the majority of which are represented by journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, since President Enrique Pena Nieto was sworn in in office in December 2012, at least 25. 589 journalists have been under state protection following attacks and threats, and this year at least seven journalists have so far been killed in seven states.
The latest deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"It's the biggest mistake to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence makes it deeply felt, although his presence can be perceived everywhere in the facade of Ms. Riodoce's building hangs a large picture of the average finger-pointing Valdez with the letter "Justice" and two of the 30th-ranked reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts featuring his smiling glasses in his face or a distinctive panic hat.
A meeting takes place less than two months after he died. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although a separate Public Prosecutor's Office was created in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, only two cases have been prosecuted, according to the Committee for the Defence of Journalists.
As with most annual murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime, the number of which amounts to thousands, the killers of journalists rarely end up in court.
In an editorial in Riodoce, the violence in Sinaloa continues to reflect, though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without murder data and justice, the security meeting, Ibarra said, is of little use.
"It is very nice to waste your time in this meeting," he says.
'as long as the cause is not known, you will distrust everyone '.
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the capital of the state, on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive only a few quarters before the two men stopped him at the red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which translates into the 'twelfth river'.
An armed man drove off in Valdez's car and made a nearby crash.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left behind by a woman and two adult children.
Rumours spread freely in Culiacan.
But there is essentially only silence about Valdez.
Ever since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival climbers struggle to fill a power vacuum.
Never mind that a few people, or even several, are shot every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that a graveyard abundance decorated with double-decorated mausoleums of drug kings larger than the homes of many living.
Let us forget for a moment that the time of peace refers to how a maritime state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States is managed by only one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was thoroughly aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce's co-founder and chair, Ismail Bojorquez (60), feels a huge conundrum that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes the killing was facilitated by two errors.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a cartel climber competing with Guzman's sons and at war.
This piece of correspondence may have angered the sons of suspected gang members of Hamas, who bought all copies of the publication as soon as they arrived at the newspaper stalls.
Another mistake was that Valdez, for his own security, was not forced to leave the country after a crackdown in another newspaper editorial that echoed the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had stayed alive for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he was there for ever.
He worked as a veterantry reporter at Noroes newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling $50 shares.
Bojorquez said Sinaloas "was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem."
For a long time, the newspaper gathered awareness of its bold and honest echoes, and sales and advertising grew.
Forceful studies were liked by reporters without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by the print they were able to read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Caboti award for its Latin American coverage.
In the same year, the Valdez Committee for the Defense of Journalists (AKK) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow a Mexican drug story wherever it takes.
He openly confessed to being scared.
"I want to live on," he said, accepting the AKK award.
Last October, he told TV channel Rompeviento TV in an interview that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to accept the task that another option for a journalist's office is to play a fool.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't say what was going on.
A Riodoce collective yearns Valdez, a joker who cropped like a madrus, a friend who kindly shared emboldened and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from office across the road to the El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love became fatal to him.
His death has also made them question how best to do their job and stay alive.
'He doesn't like the limbs of these women, their children, their legal businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs.
"These things should not have been touched," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is strong self-censorship and self-censorship.
Trusting your instincts.
If the thing smells suspiciously, hold off.
According to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the odds can be deceived... and so did this thing with Javier."
He and others say the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they don't apply to the toxic composition of Tamaulipasis, Veracruz, Guerreros or other states that are home to lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt public officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the Riodoce employees got together for security training, suddenly mobile phones were no longer allowed; a few days before it was revealed that the spyware sold only to governments had been used to track journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers searched for relief from the 40-degree heat in the shadow of the tree.
It appointed them to guard the Riodoce office, located in a four-storey building in Culiacan's middle-class neighbourhood.
A few reporters contemplated half-joking about whether these policemen were among the 50 per cent police officers the governor himself has stamped unreliable.
Months have elapsed since reporters traveled to mountainous lands where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
Riodoce's edition this week dealt with three main stories.
One of them was the murder of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government funds on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were abducted from one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants a quarter away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was time to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows about the restaurant, which is a memorial place for both drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered to be the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
In recent times, several IRP governors have been accused of widespread coverage of lawsuits as part of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same venue, including how the son of Guzman carrying the nickname El Chapo escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched Valdez's columnist for information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"In the past we would already have known what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose dress-building has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
'Now all channels of communication have broken down with our sources.
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they could never afford to wait for academics on behalf of the press.
Miriam Ramirez, a reporter, seized a couple of tags and headed to the local prosecutor's cabinet the next morning for a demonstration for another journalist.
Adame, of Salvador, disappeared in western Michoacan state three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned dead body has been found and, according to officials, it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists have been growing vocal across the country and scratching the phrase "SOS press" as an organised protest for walks and buildings.
On that day, President Bojorquez will be away in Washington, trying to gather international support in the Valdez case to get justice.
A day after Valdez's death while meeting the Sinaloa governor, Ramirez accused the authorities of scouring journalists and killing them because of telling the truth.
After that, he asked that he be diverted from reporting the government's actions elsewhere amid concerns that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said Mexican journalists were "constrained" by organized crime, complicit public officials and an indifferent society.
In his most recent book, "Narkopress," he wrote that reporters are not just being killed by drug gangs, but are also being done at the behest of politicians and security forces who are in the mess of organised crime.
Media monitoring group articulo 19 last year attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and state officials.
"In Mexico you die because you are going to be silenced," Ramirez said.
Murders obviously have a verdresome effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipasis six years ago.
He was found dead along with a letter presumably signed by a cartel in Los Zeta: 'I am here for my reports.'
A computer keyboard and headphones were lying beside his head.
A few publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the killing of their correspondent, Miroslava Breach, in March.
Others are letting on as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their chair in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke publicly to the drug cartels in front of a headline titled "What do you want of us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country.
It is a nervous decision.
Exile is hard to find work and they still have to pour the streets to avoid the dangers.
And sometimes they are hung, as happened presumably by photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in a Mexican apartment in 2015, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain in place and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that reporting the drug business scares her.
"Mexico is on its way to hell and that is why I will be hacking into a reporter," he said.
At midnight on one recent Friday, when the latest number had already been slashed, the riodoce editors sat on a walkway in front of the office and looted beer as suddenly everyone's phones began to vibrate.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people had been killed in flames between rival gangs and security forces, according to confirmed data.
War continued to escalate, as promised by the messages left by a number of cartels found in the area.
From the side of the walkway there, reporters posted the news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
Next day's front cover needed a change.
Another fire exchange in the region was canceled along the Siredens.
Bojorquez piled toward the police officers on guard to see if they were on alert.
If they were scared, at least they did not show it.
Beneath the massive portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, having his middle finger seen throughout Sinaloa, the Riodoce staff edged in his footsteps.
'How could any thought of closure, 'Bojorquez said,' when on the same day that Javier was killed, the trainee asked me to send him to the streets for a report? '
Dinosaur used defensive colour to prevent enemies
At first glance, it looks like shape, though quite scary.
Scientists have now unveiled the first findings regarding the incredible nature of rhino size discovered by a chicken miner, so well preserved that experts have described it as a "dinosaur Mona Lisa."
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to establish that the skin covered in his armour was a red-brown colour and his past had been somewhat 'complex'.
A report published in the journal Current Biology described the present as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
Fossiil is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the cricket era, 110 to 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation was struck by researchers describing it as "truly remarkable."
A vegetarian covered in armored armor is the best preserved type of fossil ever found, according to the magazine National Geographic.
It was found on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk, when it was mined in a Suncor millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that did not resemble the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
An discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrelli paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, it was developed to evict an animal from a 2500-pound (1,100-kilometre) plot.
After all this wandering effort, the end result is now finally ready for publicity.
'However a little bit of an eyelid, one can almost believe she is sleeping, 'said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrelli Museum, where the present is exhibited.
'It goes down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the add-on of the dinosaurs Mona.
Exploring his skin, researchers found that this plant worker, while covered in armor and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely to be significantly threatened by the meat-cooked dinosaurs.
This dinosaur, with abundant armour, used a red and white colour of protection to hide from predators, and applied a sheltering technique known as' eclipse ', which is also used by many today's animals.
It allowed the dinosaur to blend better into the surroundings and avoid enemies, according to experts, as the larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him.
A creature belonging to this 110 million-year-old family of nodosaurs reached the news for the first time in May and is now visiting the Royal Tyrrelli paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now investigated the existence and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory at the Borealopelta Markmitchell Museum, which belonged to a team that spent more than 7,000 hours exposing the animal to painstaking.
Thanks to the astonishingly good survival of the father, Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the armored animal on the body.
They discovered an eclipse - a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, which means that the onside of being was darker than the bottom.
Although the eclipse is common, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is far greater than the animals living in today's eclipse.
It suggests that the dinosaur was sufficiently actively hung by other meat-eaten dinosaurs that evolution preferred survival tactics to take refuge instead of confrontation.
But most of the animals that use modern countereclipse - such as fears, sebras or armadills - are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nodosaurus had to make a real effort to survive.
"A vigorous hunt for the dinosaur covered in immensely large and abundant armour shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the chopped era could have been," Brown said.
A chemical analysis of sodomy organic compounds also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was red-carved.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal in order to obtain clues about its life, including the preserved content of its bowel, in order to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur collapsed into a river in the death, thus reaching the sea with a stream, where it spilled its back in front of the ocean bed.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to reach much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable as he is fully covered in the preserved armoured skin, while he has also remained three-dimensional, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the age of the crib.
It doesn't take much imagination to reconstruct it - you just need to chase your eyes and seem to be sleeping like that.
A crisis era was a time when huge, two-legged muscle-eating dinosaurs - teropods - were sunk on Earth.
Although King Tyrannosaurus rex of them all lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been hung by some of his formidable predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a monster of 38 feet (11.5 metres) long and six tonnes.
Researchers, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was washed into the sea after the death and this mumified the mud.
A present was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined a millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved Final dinosaur in the world, including leather and armored, and is complete from cone to hip.
These conjectures were on average 18 feet (five metres) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
Its shoulders were invaded by two 20 inches of ora.
Scientists believe that this armored oak-coated adventure through current western Canada until the flooded river boasts its open sea of pride.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial site helped preserve the oddly detailed nature of its armour.
The remnants of this particular specification are so well preserved that the dinosaur headstones along mysterious armbands still cover the skin's remains.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the journal National Geographic: "This degree of prevalence is as rare as a lottery victory.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it feels.
The remains of the charred leather continue to cover the mysterious armored tiles on the animal's collar.
A better front leg leapts next to him, and five of the toes are stretched upwards.
I will be able to count the armbands on his plate.
How did one activist find an answer to the question 'Clock streets'?
On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell received a full shock.
Just a day after travelling to New York, it sat on a bed in a rented room through an Airbnb in St. Louisi, browsing Facebook on the phone.
He got caught up in the post by his former schoolmate.
It read: 'Police have just killed an 18-year-old youngster and he is still lying on the street.'
He was confused about why no one else had posted that information on his stream, which is why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
Posts by the constant @ TheePharoah user were repeatedly shared on her timeline.
A spate from the St. Louisi area broadcast a live shuttle on the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black lad who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
'It is crazy, 'Ferrell gushed about himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put off his phone, but later in the evening saw the glitch again, which this time reported a gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
Photos were shared of police footage and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown's father and holding a label with the letter, 'Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!'.
He watched a live stream where a policeman stood with a grazing dog in front of a group of protesters.
In another video, another policeman vandalised, according to him, a gun and shouted, "I will kill you all... animals."
Ferrell recalls how he hit himself with the thought: 'It's unusual.'
'It's not the kind of murder that we are used to and that we might call typical.
I felt scary at that point.
I was angry and crying.
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
Having landed at 23 a.m., she went to the father after her six-year-old daughter and decided they would sail for twins Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is a central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" Which will be presented in cinemas on 11 August.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness from the perspective of the people who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell chatted with her daughter - who was wearing a floral dress and a fitting crown with it on her head - heading for Ferguson, they once again chatted about the topic they had been told repeatedly before this morning - about black experiences and living conditions.
'Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for their rights? 'She recalls asking herself.
'Let's drive Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right.
'i was not able to take him along, 'Ferrell said afterwards.
'What is happening now is... the culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He needs to learn about activism and organizing while also getting to know the different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we need to do to become free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to grow her so that she doesn't experience personally blatant racism, she doesn't differ from some other black girl.
I feel I would do him a disservice if I protected him from this world.
The first stop they made when they came to Ferguson was on the way to South Florist - from the police station across the road in a place that had become a kind of camp where activists were waiting for news of the policeman Darren Wilson, who was never ultimately charged.
Ferrell and his daughter joined forces there with a local business owner who prepared the lunches.
They put food bags together and helped to share them with the protesters.
For Ferrelli, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she said, noting that when she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louisi, she was president of the Minority Student Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organizing experience.
It all just landed.
Weeks later, Ferrell met with fellow film director Sabah Folayan during the evening's demonstration.
Folayan said he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was happening.
In Ferrelli's mind, the question emerged: "Are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited?"
Such scepticism was due to countless cases in which people - often white people - come into the community and try to profit from its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: 'We had heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson was not heard and we wanted to do it differently.'
Folayan had already struck hands with fellow director Damon Davis, a regional artist who was known for activism in connection with prisoners on death row.
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrell and six other locals who were watched for years by the team in the film "Whose Streets?" After Brown's shooting.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, but we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
'It was important to me how these people would be portrayed, as I would be portrayed as such.
Although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell - it was intended to show that the movement was not about "the redemptor leader, but about bringing the community together," as Folayan said - he was the most open player in the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" Surprisingly documents personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
'i felt as if I was naked, 'Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the finished birdie.
'But I realised that doing this work and humanising black people must be accompanied by a degree of vulnerability.
Moreover, Ferrelli's story underlines and refocuses the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Of the three instigators in the movement who thought out the subject tag # BlackLivesMatter after killing black teenager Trayvon Martin on social media in 2012, two of the movement's three instigators were gay.
"In the lead role black homosexual women have held the movement across the board," Ferrell said, "and this is precisely because we have to keep fighting on a number of fronts.
Black homosexual women must bear all the burden.
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women."
He argues, however, that "this is not a matter of some type of equal opportunity being created" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the focal point of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who was emanating the right energy," he said.
'But it's no coincidence that she was stationed directly on the front line because as a black homosexual woman living in such hubs, there's a lot at stake.
His energy can be perceived through the screen.
Meanwhile, news cameras have long disappeared from Ferguson, but racial links between the community and police remain fragile.
Ferrell's suspended sentence for blocking the road during the demonstration will last another 2.5 years.
He describes the social-political atmosphere in an area he calls home simply "a huge borough."
Nevertheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra he has eaten in memory since he took to the streets of Ferguson a full three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.
7 snap how to get over the boyfriend after Weekend party
Some of the most obstinate masters find, after a meagre feast, that which may well be helpful.
Or the saying goes from 'lightning pot shaft, shrunk'.
But it's just an inevitable postponement and a decent prank for health.
What can you do to get a better feel in the morning after today's and tomorrow's Weekend trall - or any other party - and get over the pollinator as painlessly as possible?
Drink water.
Alcohol down and on, after a great feast in the morning... or, if possible, even alcohol instead.
Because the body loses a lot of fluid when it comes to alcohol, somehow it has to be recovered.
Along with water, minerals are also flown out of the body, and the sestap is a good drink of mineral water.
As the snake is often irritated after snapping, it is particularly good if it is bubble-free or only lightly gauged.
Go for a walk.
It certainly wouldn't cost to go to the grandmother to smash the trees - it could turn out to be a fatal misjudgment.
But a light walk helps the body remember again what it's like to be alive.
Lying in a tent and hanging out with pommaka is a more time-consuming way to get healthy.
Give the body energy back slowly and cautiously.
If you're getting okay from yesterday's over-drinking already, it's definitely not worth trying to charge a big fat crack.
Start with, for example, the fresh juice in which the tree grains are quietly placed to prop up your body.
If health is already suffering around the South, you could try a powder, for example.
And a little later on already wearing a selfie.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretics will free your body from the last water.
As has already been said: Water and juice are your friends.
Do not contribute to the painkillers.
If you take painkillers in the evening to prevent poachers, your tax will have to deal with paratsetamol or ibupropheen as well as alcohol and will lose the performance.
So the liver is hanging even further and will continue to be worse.
In addition, the painkiller remains in the body anyway for a long time.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it with an entirely empty stomach - it irritates your already dirty snake.
Or if you do not have a partner, you can do well with yourself.
It works about like walking, but you can't get orgasm by walking.
However, avoid too active a tempo and exorbitant posturing - physical exertion should be moderate in the time of the pommell.
Make fun of it.
With the friends and fellow sufferers of time there is a flurry of words, simple pleasures and laughter amicably over themselves and others (suffering).
Jokes and laughter may not be chopped off, but they certainly have more fun to endure the afternoons.
Once, the pommell goes over anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University staff are being searched as suspects in murder
A Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who has become suspects after finding the dead body of a male crowd with deadly stab wounds from one Chicago luxury apartment is being sought nationwide, police say.
Arrest warrants were issued Monday for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren on charges of first-degree murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to court documents in Cook County.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated pushback.
According to a warning issued by a Chicago police station to the community, the dead body was discovered on July 27.
A police officer received a phone call and found a victim with multiple stab wounds on his body when he arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment house.
Officials said Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and investigators are treating the stabbing as murder while police are actively searching for the two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of public relations at the university, said in a statement sent as an email that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from work and has been barred from entering Northwestern University city halls.
"It is now a criminal matter being investigated by the competent authorities and the University of Northwestern is cooperating with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant at Oxford University's financial department.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in a statement forwarded as an email: 'We have been in contact with Britain's police and are willing to assist US investigative authorities in any way we can.'
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and willing to extradite him.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of communications at Chicago police station, urges suspects to hand themselves up to the authorities.
"Police have an idea of where they are staying, but we are dealing with defining the exact location more and more intensively," Guglielmi said.
Local, regional and national authorities are helping to search the suspects, according to Guglielm.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from a trustee of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received cryptic hint that something had happened in the apartment at No 1008.
According to police descriptions, this was a gruesome sight.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the event itself also took place on 27 July.
He said security cameras confirm the presence of Lathem and Warren in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
Management at Grand Plaza sent a letter to residents saying: "Police are currently working to establish the chronology of events and the background of the victim and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that the act was a family quarrel."
Start-ups to help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure worker satisfaction at her e-commerce start-up, but the polls were futile.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse still, misleading.
And even if he promised to secure anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"It just wasn't consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs an e-commerce company selling hair-care products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called for external assistance.
New types of human resources start-ups are emerging, helping companies figure out what their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software that is firmly designed to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to conduct flash surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and a hot line of complaints and, in some cases, allow emperors to bypass C-level managers and turn directly to the board.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" Asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
According to Erretti, in the three years he has used Glint, he has got a much better view of what he employees think and feel.
In addition to interviews with app surveys and firm teams, it offers a company heat card that provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which executives have the lowest support, allowing it to identify the reasons.
Companies have begun to understand that they need to stay up to date with their working culture so as not to become the next Uber, which has been embroiled in scandals ever since a former employee published a blogpost that described a harrowing environment punishing those who dared to speak out.
For start-ups like Glint, the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation and compliance could be worth more than $120.7 billion by 2020, according to financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a start-up firm in Colorado in Denver that helps companies prevent and identify inappropriate behavior, observed an increase in interest and activity this year amid Uber's suspicious reputations.
Convercentil has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered itself as a customer.
Like Gling, Convercent lets companies send tailored impulse polls, collect confidential answers in real time and watch heat cards from problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
And when the CEO is involved, the complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has been angered by regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and chief executive of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees badly or to behave unethically, the company could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of rules and procedures and provide an easy way to interact with the corporation's headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find the corporation's headquarters telephone number or email address, file a formal complaint and hope it would be taken seriously.
It was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, said James Vitrano, general counsel for Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no good way to monitor employee complaints.
However, with the company now using Convercent, problems such as discrimination, harassment or dishonest wage practices that did not previously reach leaders who operated in offices in other cities or states can be quicker to identify and deal with.
"I can get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of employees," said Vitrano, who heads the risk management group Ruby Tuesday.
"And we will protect our shareholders from litigation with our employees."
Mr Quinlan said the companies began taking ethical behavior, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, or after accountancy firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in relation to the Enron scandal.
But it was only when "social media got mature," businesses realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from washing online in public.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking periodic charges from companies for using their products.
It's a business model and an option with the approval of venture capital investors who have been in favour of both start-ups.
Convercenti was funded in February by firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tusk Capital, raising $47 million in value for the capital it collected.
Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, raising the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments will come as no surprise given the interconnectedness of companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that today's workers expect more from the workplace than they have done in the past.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are merely stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they are devoting their time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy at the company, feel they are being listened to and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to making the company succeed," said Nina McQueen, vice president of the general benefit and staff experience department at LinkedIni, which uses both Convercenti and Glint.
Investors are generating revenue when their portfolio companies are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are engaged and involved.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they will find support.
Having data on employee involvement is important, according to experts in the workplace culture.
But that data will be useless if the company's afterviewers don't pick up on them.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it may raise expectations that changes are ahead.
And if changes aren't happening fast enough or not at all, it could cause disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consultancy and business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
'Because if things weren't brought to an end, the staff are wondering, 'Have you really listened to me?
Do you care?
And if you do not care, why should I care? '
According to Erretti, Madison Reedil, who now organises six studies among employees, has been able to take action on the same day as the problem has been reported via Glint.
And after receiving feedback from frustrated employees about the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams at the company and provide communications training to deal with problems.
However, new data on workers is being collected in Ruby Tuesdays and it is hoped that in the long term, it will bring with it a longer-term commitment of workers in an industry known for its high flow of labour.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you lose people," Vitrano said.
"And when you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses.
Eurozone shining star is Baltics: Earnings grow fast
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching income from the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes in reference to the ECB's report.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, the total output of the economy per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Low indebtedness, rapidly improving institutions and business and free market-friendly policies are the key to success.
"The Baltic States, together with Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries where jet GDP per head of purchasing power is significantly closer to the EU average," the central bank reported.
Although the aim is that the total output of the economy per capita equates to the richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was just 2/3 of the average of 15 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led baltons to seek better wages from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltimore in a positive light, and the economy is also growing this year, the local population is not at all enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, little less than half of those surveyed thought this about the economies of their countries.
NCAA's decision to cancel double daily roughs makes Bruins days long
It is almost 23 a.m. when trophy UCLA footballers stop to chat at the edge of a new exercise square in the team's university district.
A pair of them have strayed from the back of the shirt, revealing their training camp's first-day effort with a sweat back.
For much of the team, these powerminutes offer a midday break.
In the summer courses, players heading back to the pool for final exams after a three-hour tour before returning to the Wasserman Football Centre for meetings at 6.30pm the following morning.
"Next three days is a real challenge for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday's win on Tuesday.
NCAA's decision to cancel double daily roughs to reduce players' load has actually made their days longer - at least until the final exams to one side on Friday.
For that reason, UCLA's first three training sessions were timed to start at 19.15 to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
A move from two training sessions a day means more one-on-one days - the start of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead of last season and for the first time in Mora's six Westwood seasons, workouts will take place during summer courses.
Neil is scheduled to have 18 runs until August 20 before starting formal preparation for the opening game against Texas A & M in September.
MORA said he is in favour of NCAA rule change, although it adds another item of agenda to the close schedules of players.
"They have a huge load on three or four days and that is a serious challenge," Mora said.
'And they break themselves out of this ordeal; they tighten, they are nice young.
I believe that when Saturday arrives and we have more time it will be really nice.
Once the camp is over, UCLA's workouts will turn into a close one, however, which is no easy task given the clear view of their squares from nearby parking lot and the outsider Luskin Centre, a higher-class hotel that has already been hit by a gateway from the surrounding defensive net escaped by footballers.
From this weekend, the Bruins players will be occupied by the hotel, but Mora admitted that problems could arise with free rooms over the course of the season.
"We are implementing security measures," Mora said.
'It's a real concern and it's not at all exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film a workout from there.
If you have a recording of a workout, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we use the security team there and on the 8th parking lot.
We will do our best using the available.
I am trying not to worry much about it.
We have a plan in place.
In retaliation for the election union of Savisaare-Ivanova, ousted from the Reform Party by Kristiina Ojuland and forced to join the forces of the Commons, Maria Kaljuste, created to show the seats of the businesspeople Two-Ivanova, it seems that the electoral alliances set up in the initiation of the parties in local elections this year will be attended by at least the same number of political parties.
However, the tweets will be counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether enough frustrated voters will be available to them all.
Who will remain with Savisaaren?
If petty has diminished the support of Edgar Savisaare, one can guess the events organised in honor of his electoral union.
One member of the National Assembly, some former and current medics and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And is the reason why some of Savisaare's faithful followers and friends are being sidelined from the candidacy in Tallinn to look for the absence of the 'Savisaare list', led by corrupt and suspected corruption crimes, to become a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the municipality for a Russian pop-up attended by a parent of the district of Lasnamäe; and in every sense a rudimentary computer game in which the main character, Jüri Ratas, has to avoid flushes and slaves on the road while riding on the rat - will the Central Party seek votes for the first time among the 16 and 17-year-olds allowed to enter the ballot box?
We look forward to seeing other parties understand the outgoing election campaign.
If Channel 2 or TV3 viewers look against a black square instead of entertainment from the beginning of August, there will be two options: Accept that henceforth only ETV, ETV2, ETV +, Tallinn TV and English-language France24 channels or divest each month's tens to some TV operators.
There are probably also those who at first openly rejoice over the advertising-free television experience, but ultimately, albeit reluctantly, pay for television images and advertisements.
Deafening music, noisy folk and junk left on the streets are the unpleasant side-effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don't want to be part of the melus yourself, however, it's worth going home instead of painting your head - and leaving the bedroom for a hefty amount for festival guests.
Washington changes green card rules
Media outlets cite President Donald trump as saying a new US immigration plan is planned that will change the rules of the green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people per year, stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-orientated visas.
New rules have been proposed by Republicans and the president supports them.
Bill goes to two chambers of Congress for debate.
'It's the law that reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money as it changes the way the US issues green cards for citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and begin to replace the current programme.
A new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and have funds to support themselves and skills that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, according to US media outlets.
The young people of the Siberian Seto are moving to the city, the pensioners returned to the land.
Jevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous seto gold miners along the former Maana River.
He works 140 kilometres from home in a rural extra drive along Kuvai in a gold order as a driver.
It's a tough job:12 hours of work without rest days for two months in a row and then only ten days at home and back again.
During the three years worked at Artel, Anatoli has seen gold only once.
'There is a hard procedure: When you go in, you thoroughly check that the vodka does not bring, and when you go out so that you do not take the gold, 'says Anatoli.
Mare Piho chatted to the local seto Jaan in the village of Haida, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
An archaic culture still preserved in the Siberian setode will also begin to affect home-sectoms because it's just so fabulous, thinks the most thoroughly distant sediments researched Piho Mare.
His first research trip to Siberia will last 30 years this year.
During this time he has been there 14 times and lived there for a year in total.
How much did it still migrate to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get its land?
This is an unresolved issue.
I say that 8,000.
I calculated it according to the stories of the Siberian Seto men, who have also thought about it themselves.
It is difficult to say exactly, because up to 30 people could come in one group at the time, but the passport was only given to the man.
The passport was given only to one, but with him were children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look at how great the territory was here!
It was many times bigger than the historic Setomada.
After all, it needed to be educated, managed in some way.
Setod came here as peasants, but their lives changed because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (wage-parting), the gold mines, the industry.
In New Petseri, for example, many of the setos later went to work in the classified town of Krasnojarsk-45 (where the Soviet authorities built a uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the sectomobiles constitute the majority of the population in this region at the time?
Yes, they lived in a compact way.
In addition, the tradition of getting married and being multi-chillingly preserved for a long time.
Seven to eight children in the family were common.
How much did the Siberian setode culture differ and differ from that of the mother-country sectoms?
They are different, although what was brought here was never the same there.
They brought with them a great many popular ideas.
Then they did themselves (people's ideas), but they always made a difference, which was brought about and which had been done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional clothing of the pigs, because it is colder here.
Meals changed.
For example, Setomaal meat was salted, but here it was simply frozen.
Where are the Siberian setode villages and what life are living there?/graphics: Alari Paluots
Communication with the mother country was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that this Setumaa is now beginning to give back to it, beginning to affect them.
These girls, who have lived here in families, have listened to amazing stories.
Piho is referring to the people of the Estonian setode delegation, who came to the village of Haida at the beginning of July to the day of the kingdom of Seto and lived for four days in their homes, J. P.
What is still here is staggering.
"It's super easy for Tapale to come and go away too, because the city has a great location: At the rail hub and the intersection of roads," says Reigo Tamm, an opera man from Tapa.
The city is not just a military capital for a long time, we have a lot of nature, we have sports and cultural sites and we have a seal at every corner.
Kill is the top topp city!
Along the River Belarus, which runs through the city, there is a small island where the Tapals tend to hold a retail feast.
'It doesn't look like this beautiful place from the train window, 'Reigo gushes.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in this river because the river is full of sources.
I have been swimming there, I can do it!
On the water of the river you can hold a picnic and simply make a romance - you can see the flow of the river and think ahead and back to life.
I have also walked there with my brows.
From opera to Tamm, apart from anything else, there have been three bridges on the river bank to get used to their aarias: "That this place is beside the city, no one may be reluctant to come when their stories are told."
"A wonderful view of Tapa opens from the Männik Mountain, but there are also Tervisers where you can run, skip the winter, and play discgolf at the moment, for example - the golf course is done, the discs can be borrowed from the sports centre," Governors Reigo.
The old professors go there with their bodies, of course, but I have not yet been able to play there.
Mr Rasmus KULL must be invited to visit Tapa, as he is an experienced discgolfing player and has discs.
Maybe he lends me!
The Reigo and the Männikumägi were inseparable from the childhood of the present opera personality.
At least during the skiing hours.
A lot of tears, disappointments and victories in my sports life have been left on this mountain.
Not to mention the broken rocks and skis.
"All the city centre is currently full of construction works, all of which becomes unknown," Reigo praises.
A tapas old and tired womb building, however, is a very attractive place to play with summer discoveries.
I am pleased that March Märt Meos, the head of the R.A.M in 2012, accepted my idea and had to make a vaguous summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theater season with Aleksei Karen has just got through, on 11 August the railway station is' Smoking ', when the old whale building is moving around in the 1980s.
"Between 11 and 13 August, the days of Tapa City have woken up to open home cafes on top of the vapour building and there are rides for cultural events, including a crowdhall," says Reigo, who advises a visit to the city from 9-year-old just on noil days.
In a tiny yellow housekeeper's May 1 wooden road, the museum has been around since 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are well and the information is vast," praises Reigo's place, which is full of Tapa city history, most of which focuses on the railway and the military.
The Reigo is concerned that if Tapal goes through all the recommended sites, the belly will be empty long, but fortunately the small town will be full of cafes.
"We have such good eateries and when sitting in cafes sometimes you get the feeling that you are abroad," she describes.
Educated and young soldiers from Tapale spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so when you sit there, you have a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home town, but there is such an international community around you.
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we have a lot of movement!
In Greece, two Bulgarians arrested for illegal tendering
A TV channel bTV quoted a foreign ministry reporting that two Bulgarians were taken into custody in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of 1 August, police arrested a group of illegally ordered people on the Sithonian Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but an investigation is under way.
A foreign ministry told TV channel bTV that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tendering and are already imposing harsh fines on anyone who is caught resting in a place that is not intended to do so.
Inspections will continue throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court could impose a fine.
The wolves who teach puppies are breaking sheep.
Farmers in Hiiumaa will have to give 'study material' to wolves again after a year break - wolves who apparently taught puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, 23 sheep in total and eight have been injured, writes the Hiiu page.
Last year the number was only three, 124 a year earlier.
In sync with the Murduste, the Environment Agency also has data that wolf nests were not born in Hiiumaa last year and information from the Hiiumaa hunting council that two wolf nests have been fixed on the island this year.
On a night out against Monday, wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Capuna in Emgist, and injured 18 surviving sheep sides.
In the early hours of Wednesday morning, wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of the village of Rehebacks and badly injured another who had to be made an emergency killing.
Rules on the treatment of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft Act on the Environmental Modification of genetically modified organisms (GMOs VS) and the Plant Protection Act to the round of coordination.
The amendment to the law forbids the creation of a separate data collection for both GM crop sites and business operators, with the use of a plant health register in the future.
In addition, the obligation of GM crop handler to have a prior agreement with the beekeeping person within the prescribed radius will be amended.
Although, at the moment, GM crops are not cultivated in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non-GM crops.
This is at least until the decision has not been made to declare Estonia GMO-free, "said Sigmar Suu Kyi, head of the plant health department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be purposeful and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens involved in both the private and public sectors," Ms Suu Kyi added.
The draft law repeals the provisions related to the data collection and treatment training of GM crop sites and operators in GMO VS, establishes requirements for the management of GM crops and the commencement of economic activities.
As regards beekeeping in particular, the commitment to date of the GM crop educator to inform beekeepers about the start of GM crop cultivation with the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before starting cultivation will be replaced.
A draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties will have the opportunity to examine the proposals in the information system and, if they wish, submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The proposed changes will affect, in particular, those working in the field of crop farming, beekeepers and the agricultural authority.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - the maize MON 810 - is allowed to be grown.
Up to now, however, none of the Estonian farmers have any interest in cultivating GM crops.
This is due to the fact that in Estonia there is no landlord, a European Pharmaceutical, for which the landline MON 810 is resistant.
Varieties of this maize line have also been cultivated for the southern regions, and this May is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In order to obtain certainty, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 on the detection of possible contamination by GM organisms in seeds of various suviras, maize and soya varieties cultivated in Estonia.
The analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds were not contained and the study concluded that seeds of rapeseed, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, one can conclude that GM crops are not being deliberately cultivated in Estonia, and that there has also been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruit 'genius' in form of Nemanja Maticu
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited 'genius' in the form of Nemanja Maticu after the midfield player made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
A player who was bought over from Chelsea for 40 million pounds started in Dublin United's last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday with a 2-1 victory in the starting line-up, impressing in the defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on the offensive drills.
But having missed the Blues' pre-season Asian Cup, Maticu missed a badly-needed matchup and only held on for 45 minutes, which Mourinho said must be corrected before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant mindset - he has a mindset of football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to achieve form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the starting line-up at the Aviva stadium, and Mourinho began quietly putting his one-start man in place by the start of the season.
According to The Independent this week, Mourinho is still keen to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed the club has already done an "excellent job" by signing contracts with three of his four priority selections.
'i am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three of the four, 'he added.
'i am even happier if they can make four out of four but they have worked hard for me.
Another warm son was caught on the foot by a GSM transmitter on 1 August and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird observer who lives in the Ring, the first ex-son was equipped with an embassy in the Ring, and this laundry is already flying around, has left the nesting place and joined the large nightmare of the Mullutu-Great Bay.
This is because the Ring is not a field of grain, Saarte Voice writes.
This Tuesday, it was relatively late for the Kurds to rally, and it was on the island of Muhu.
Martinson said that installing transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a spawned son named Mati GSM sent to Turkey in the Ring.
'His dealings are all watched online: How he went to the winter in Spain, coming back to the border between Germany and Poland, and then came to Saaremaa, 'Martinson spoke.
British inventor let mounted microchip into his body to get handcuffed into house and car
A British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so that he could only open his front door with a handshake, get into the office and even run a car.
33-year-old Steven Northam allowed a tiny chip to be installed between his thumb and name ring and is now offering this service to companies and private individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant and anesthesiologist at Hampshire County Royal Hospital in Winchester, to ensure the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip mounted on cats and dogs, and the procedure takes just 30 seconds.
A Northam company will also replace the locks of houses and cars to fit in with a chip, asking for 300 pounds for one lock.
This married father of one child has now installed the technology in both his home and his car, BMW Z4, which takes off when his hand is on the wheel.
A White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands
According to military documents disclosed to TIME magazine, the White House's decision to airlift a Navy helicopter to the southern courthouse cost taxpayers as much as $24,000 for an event celebrating American production last month.
Green and white paint Sikorsky VH-3D, dubbed Marine One during the president's boarding party, was the centrepiece of the event showcasing American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
In a tweet, President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials were briefing industrial products from all 50 states on their circuit.
A helicopter built in Connecticut was showcased alongside a hunk from Maine, a fire truck coming from Wisconsin and a pallet truck made in Mississippi.
According to documents provided by Marine Helicopter Squadron One, the White House's military cabinet narrowly demanded the presence of a helicopter, or FARGO, 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the southern courthouse for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually high-profile event," HMX-1's commander said in an email to his boss, deputy head of the Navy's leading officer in the field of aviation, the day before the event.
In the message it was noted that the helicopter arrives at the southern courthouse at around 3pm on the morning of July 17 and will remain there until the shoulder is cleared between 6pm and 21 on the same night.
Added to this was the fact that if leaving the White House were to be delayed, a return flight would require a second ekipad due to restrictions on working time.
An original flight crew was at a helicopter during the event, and an escadre security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to read out from the documents given to the magazine TIME whether the second ekipage was eventually needed or not.
Hatch's law prohibits federal employees from using government assets for political purposes.
Documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether the given event could breach that provision.
"We asked if this was in violation of the Hatch Act and we were told not to violate it," the commander wrote.
'It seems you have no choice, 'the deputy chief of the leading officer responded.
The White House declared the event 'made in America' to be an official event, and the Hatch Act would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
During the event, the president backed the efforts of health care reform that were under discussion in the Senate at the time and praised efforts to keep government regulations in place.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically lucrative purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely as photovoltaic is unusual.
Trump came under the spotlight in February as his first campaign event in Florida, Melbourne, came from a water background on a presidential plane, and his Twitter account spawned messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"A white house is very pleased with the display" made in America, "where products from all 50 states produced by American workers in American materials were represented," said White House spokeswoman deputy attorney general Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 teams often do test flights around Washington and in the southern courtyard to practice stamping down the US president to the White House with sentimeter accuracy.
Once Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 orchestrated 58 attempts at landing in the White House courthouse.
According to the official, the flight to the event was thought to be among the standards for "American-made" air crew tuition flights that month.
Escadre helicopters flew another 11 hours on top of that day for "non-presidential support missions."
According to the White House, no other exhibit at the event boasted the taxpayer's purse.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in organizing the exhibit on the helicopter's southern courtyard.
HMX-1 will not retain budget documents for the president's flights, and the exact costs of the event will be hard to figure out.
But according to the Department of Defense's annual hourly rates for the 2017 financial year, the VH-3D is a compensation rate of $24,380 per hour per flight.
Escadr documents marked the length of the flight from its main base to the Navy's Quantico airport in both directions from Virginia for 30 minutes.
The White House argues that the real cost of helicopter use is well below that amount.
"It is very misleading to calculate taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates," Walters said.
"These estimated compensatory rates include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Department of Defense's compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they do cover the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracts.
Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended using a helicopter at the time at the event.
"It is the point of the matter to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
'And I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are presumably hundreds, if not even thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So of course it is right to highlight this.
It's not clear whether Trump was in touch with a helicopter during a circuit in the southern courtyard as part of the event, but he sat behind the wheel of the fire car.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's representatives, casting media outlets joking about the company's products in his personal aircraft park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - Through tears arrived for peace and joy
Mil Daegus, 2011, hit out at Šadeikot in the last area, 800 metres in the run of a shoe ramp, and was taken away from the stadium with a peg on a wearing camera.
Just before that, he had been getting zero in the distance jumps at a universiade held in China.
In 2012, the Helsinki EMI spotted a low-cost injury, but in a debut round in London, she earned her 23rd spot with 6013 points.
Misfortune continued, however.
Moscow MMil in 2013 suffered a thumb injury after an opening day in the schedule of the Estonian record.
He won 15th place at the Beijing Mil two years later and filled the Olympic slam, but that was more than a wanted athlete's disappointment.
The heaviest cabbage was passed only last year by Mr Šadeiko, when the result was not first recorded in the far-flung jumps of Amsterdam Emil.
I would just like to put together a proper multi-competition once or for all.
Once, 'said Shadeiko.
Worse was still to come: A month later, his Olympic contest in Rio broke down on the first hurdle because of a relapse.
Time had to be taken down - did the seven-race go ahead at all?
Is two days of effort still worth all that?
He thought for a long time, but he found peace.
I got my head clean to think
It is relatively difficult to describe this experience, but I have thought that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Luckily, there was time to heal yourself and think clean your head.
'i knew I would still miss the pills, 'Shadeiko says of his self-purity.
I was able to turn the clean sheet and get on with the new momentum.
According to trainer Anne Mountain, it was very difficult to watch the suffering of the caretaker, but she understood that, above all, the athlete had to clear herself.
After all, he was so shot by everyone.
It was hard to endure.
"Grit, however, said he would not give up and he wanted to prove to himself what he was worth," Mountain says.
Now he has some sort of peace.
He makes it to his own delight.
The contest was back in May when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in a multi-contest at Göttingen.
In a high-profile contest, he improved personal top brands in a bullet breed by nearly a metre (13.89) and ran in a barrier run of record time.
Then the multi-contestant felt that this was not the ceiling of the ability, but only the initial competitive hunger was extinguished.
The Mountain has been instructing him for years, saying that Shadeiko is a black student.
He is a ready athlete, it is good to train him.
If something does trouble or is wrong, he says it straight away.
He knows his own body and trusts his sense of feeling.
That is what we need to build on.
I cannot say what exactly needs to be done and we will follow it.
A new approach has also been found by Mr Šadeiko.
'i'm not the one who does the rough to the maximum, 'he says and says that the most important thing is getting the right sensation, because it also guarantees a good result.
Close baby bump makes joyful move
Good emotions have also been offered to Šadeiko by the good fortune of the close ones.
Both her former workout fellow Maris Mountain and sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-contestant has received support from new weather citizens.
'It has been quite interesting, 'says Mr Šadeiko.
One alcoholic whose drinking equates to 'training' of the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is a surety so great wine fan that believes - with wine you can train the brain better than with any other thing in the world.
Mr Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, this is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the 'very active' wine tasting process.
By scouring the glass, tricking the wine in the mouth, enjoying it and sensing the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for wine.
According to Sheperd, liquid olecules don't really contain the flavour, but taste is generated by the way the wine stimulates the brain.
He brings comparisons to how the brain "looks" in the colors.
"Flavour is not in wine, the flavour creates a wine delicious," says Sheperd.
Things that still affect the appearance of the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender and even the amount of syllabuses that man produces.
Sheperd, of course, admonishes that wine is not for himself to be filled with drink.
"There has to be more in action," he says.
If you take too big a limp, the system is oversaturated.
Excessive drinking of wine can do harm to the brain instead of benefits - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, losing balance and reduced mental capacity are risking.
10% of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia get lower salaries than colleagues
Data from Personnel Search firm Fontes reveal that 10% of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia are paid less than colleagues.
A ten per cent pay gap is between men and women, the portal writes genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector pay survey for Fontese.
A total of 8,577 posts was examined.
63% of the positions were employed by men.
"Although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and the rest of the companies believe there is no pay gap, compared to reality, the basic salary of the month for men is 10% higher than that for women on average, and the total salary of the men's year is 8% higher than that of women," said Ilmar North, an analyst at Fontese.
'Narcos' 3rd season promotional clip: Now that Pablo Escobar has gone, Netflix hitch series takes centre stage at Cali cartel
Despite revealing the killer of Pablo Escobar in the second season of "Narcos," Netflix's sari is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first has already been completed with a promotional clip that will soften the series with new sins.
In the third season, the DEA will turn its attention to the world's richest drug business organization - the Cali cartel.
They operate under the four powerful godfather "like the Fortune 500 company," simply with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) of its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) steers ties with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a newly released promotional clip, Pedro Pascali sees the return of Javier Penana, a figure recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement to help in the war against drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will be the opening break on 1 September.
Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics, says UN
A head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the election can only represent the nation if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said hundreds of women stand in local council elections, three women stand as vice-president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of the role of women by emphasising the importance of it," she said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and can only be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
Local Afghan Soviet elections and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
For its part, the Taliban has threatened an electoral process that coincides with a transition period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is calmly transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysomi said the strong role women play is increasing the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
Of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women, according to Afghanistan's Independent Electoral Commission.
The joy of sharing makes every thing more acute, both large and small.
The common time is always too little, but the trenn pins provide a good opportunity to combine meeting, play, proximity and load.
And what a comfortable solution - whichever way you cruise in the summer, you always have a life spinning and an impatient reminder of your fine voice: 'Let's go now!'
Start with a warm-up - it is very good to have a normal cup game or to slip along the beach bar.
Knife is the bedrock of standing on the feet and in the shape of the dash - who would then want to take the shape of a sand cake that swam from the waves during the summer?
It is wonderful to use children instead of chicken!
First of all, it is secure and comfortable, the weight is gradually growing at the same pace as the trainer's force.
The advanced ones can also be fuelled with pretty big children.
The child trains the balance, reads the repetitions and feels the fun of being able to feel high and important.
Larger children can, at the same time, fuel themselves.
The scope of the movement lay in place the touch of the earth and the silhouetting of the hands.
Keep your fingers straight, ask for a mini-helper to hold up properly.
A child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
Plank is a superfluous but hopelessly boring exercise for a child.
But it is easy to do more fun!
Game-plank: Take a long plank column from which to fold through.
In fact, it is more difficult than usual to do, but much more fun than in the meantime a friend can shake hands.
In order to add the load, you can stay in the plank, and walk around in that position.
Extra weight can be put on the baby's hips, but this exercise offers fun for all children.
At the same time as crabs stump on the sand, the load of triseps, ash and stomach muscles gets like an infection.
A child descends on his feet so that his body weight is evenly spread out in front and back.
Security can be held back.
Curl the legs and stretch straight up.
Good luck can fly, have fun, strike the balance and be difficult.
The life of a small coach is an exuberance when he gets a little muscle at every turn up.
Extra load gives the sledging of your legs in advance.
Check that the back is in neutral position.
Children themselves have a lot of amusing muscles to do in a couple and with a patch.
Barefoot and pulse.
Follow the child's safety, knee position, and hold your back in a neutral position.
Favourite and great fun for all children!
For the older, however, a really effective whole body trenn.
Sports tools included Ott (10), Säde (8), Jäne (4).
Trip from the Philippines to the heart of the fashion fans
Beer-red bags are a summer classic, which has become a hitch product on its own in recent years, even having to hang on to one of the right summer's authors, and which merchants, despite its modest origin, have been able to boil an appropriate price tag on the hite.
A bouquet of beers is probably one of the things that has existed on a fair occasion in life, and the possession of which has not aroused much emotion.
It just exists, and if it doesn't, there is nothing broken either.
Now, though, the beer bags are making a real win, and fashion fans have turned their fine designer bags for the summer months instead of simple beer-red bags.
It is not only a beach bag but, today, it is also just as popular as a street bag, and more courageous women even walk into an office.
At this point, however, it is worth making clear before we see whether a summer loop like this for the boss still sits or pays to delay the notebook and laptop into a slightly more official summer.
However, the spirit wealth has made beer bags a true summer love for women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion jets, the first thing to do is to keep an eye on the fact that fashion gurmakers make their first appearance on the local market during their holiday trip and acquire a few beer bags, then a whole holiday-maker faithful, accompanied by beach, market and also girlfriends in hats on the city.
Indeed, some bloggers are so generous that they buy bags from the market with more wolves and sell or give away to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting, however, that the demand for bags is so high among readers that, in the real world, women (and men!) probably go fishing to each other in order to become a happy owner of a few bags.
In some ways, that kind of madness is understandable, too, because it is rare for fashion to be able to buy some of the things that have gone up in hitchhiking for just a few euros.
It is true that rowdy merchants have also discovered a simple way of earning money here, and so the finer luxury brands also sell their bags for a few hundred and -thousand euros.
Apparently, it's still the case that wealthier customers shouldn't feel like easy mortals promending around with some cheap bags.
For example, you can buy Dolce & Gabbana over a thousand euros of tasting beer bag.
However, an interpretation of Chanel's brewing bag can be found in the circle of EUR 6,000.
However, unlike most fashion buildings, the straw bags do not originate from some of the great fashionistas, but their story originated far away.
Indeed, the breweries reportedly come from far away from the Philippines, from which they have been deprived.
Baring a bag of beer is primarily an export business there, and locals are very often not seen running around with them.
It is said that the cutting technique dates back to the 14th century and is quite generous with the usual basket-bashing.
However, because the beer bag doesn't have to be as heavily red as baskets, they can be intertwined with musters and other materials that make the bag more personalised and, by that, more actrative.
For example, there are particularly trendy bags lately, with red coloured bandages or leather crickets.
In particular, however, brewing bags can be sent to actress Jane Birkin, the biggest red-haired brewery fan not seen before.
Notably, she matched a beer bag to all sorts of clothing sets and didn't even think much of it would go to the Cannes Film Festival.
Nowadays, the popularity of bags does not play a smaller role, but it is also the fact that they are looked after by a head and, unlike all other summers, do not have to care for them with special means, but the water and wet towel also drives the thing.
As is the case with trend robbers, apart from the classical appearance, brands have come up with all sorts of interpretations.
For example, you may want to buy a red ridice or a tiny bag of oil from your shoulders.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic brewing bag will never go out of fashion, but beer yoke.
But, what is the classic shoulder bag then?
For centuries, it has been considered classic to be a red bag of shoulders resembling a basket from its style, open from the side, and short, as well as shoulders, knives.

GMB worries about investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
A union is awaiting confirmation from executives at cookie manufacturer McVitie over long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent about the future of investment in the Tollcrossi object.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
McVitie's owner Pladis said they had invested more than 5 million pounds in the object over the past few years.
Workers were hired there, and union chairmen "are the first to hear" if something changes in plant activity.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland's company, McVitie, called on "to launder concerns that the funding will not be used to modernise production lines."
Drew Duffy, senior organiser at GMB, said: "The fact that we don't get clarity from the site's chief operating officer about the Tollcrossi's business needs and future investment plan is a cause for deep concern for our members.
Many generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow, an essential pillar for ensuring decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social exclusion.
Hence, in the face of jobs, pay and well-being in the east of Glasgow, the rise in living costs and the chronic decline in manufacturing, there is an urgent need for McVitie business with thriving productivity.
A spokesman for Pladie said: 'The site manager for Tollcrossi received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will respond directly to it as we value active communication with workers and union representatives.
A regular meeting between staff at Tollcross and GMB representatives took place two months ago to discuss a number of issues openly.
We discussed with the workers then that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years we have invested more than GBP 5 million in the Tollcrossi object, most of it has gone to production lines and streamlining operations.
We fully understand the heritage of Tollcross as a production site, and if there are any changes in the activities of the site, the workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it.
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago of an approach to Neymar?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up in the quest to lure Neymar to his ranks by making an offer of 189 million pounds to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record conquest?
It's a hard-hitting approach has opened the summer transfer window and the Ligue 1 club are ready to break the current world record of more than double-buying, which was erected last season with Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United at 89 million pounds.
Once the transition is completed, Neymar will, as a result, become the world's most expensive player and, at the same time, the highest paid professional athlete in the world, who will be able to pay more than 500,000 pounds a week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona are, of course, angry at both the manner of rapprochement and the break-up of Neymar, although a close source to Catalans' board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world about such a possibility three years ago?
In 2014, when Manchester City showed interest in signing a deal with Blaise Matuitis, Nasser warned Al-Khelaifi harshly of all clubs thinking about recruiting some of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that when they touch some of our players we will confront them and contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But when they try to make a contract with some of our players, they have to face the consequences.
Barcelona appear to have overstepped that limit as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfield player Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
It was made clear by PSG that they would not let the Italian leave on any condition and that Barcelona could get a setback as a result of that interest, losing one of their cherished assets in Neymar's form.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit.
"Brexit is seriously threatening to strike the wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," VARADKAR warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland since the inauguration in June.
'i cannot imagine who would benefit from it, 'he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods, VARADKAR said.
"It is our vision for the future: Building bridges, not borders," he stressed.
According to Varadkari, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and because it cannot be, to remain part of the European single market.
It would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the UK.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish prime minister explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Mr VARADKAR said: "We certainly could have that kind of Britain."
An alternative to this would be a return to customs posts declaring historical division and political failure.
"Barrier to trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "a challenge for our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily lives.
The Irish Prime Minister met leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when he visited Belfast.

Today, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltic States was held in the winter capital, when about a thousand triathletes from more than thirty countries entered the competition for a half-long Ironman.
A disdance of 70.3 miles consisted of 1.9 km swimming, 90 km cycling and 21.1 km cycling.

"Not the disdance is killing, but the pace is killing," he said, implying that at an affordable pace, almost everyone ends up in the finish.
Apart from Ott Sepp: 'Everything is fine with Oti's physique, but unfortunately he can't swim.'
Avandi had been zealously doing the trench since February.
At the beginning of 4-5 hours a week, but later already ten hours a week.
Time 05:34:12 he won 27th place in the overall calculation.
Although Avandi lost both Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called "class of prominants."
Last year, Tanel Padar, who was a 'good example', lost to Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Krus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
The general winner of the accounting of the men of the Oteää stage in the Ironman series was John Moldan with time 3:58:27, the best of the Estonians was Ivo Great Age 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Danish Helle FREDERIKSEN triumphed with time 04:24:01, while the Estonians lost the icy of Maria, who lost to Frederiksen in almost half an hour, and by 4:58.
Avandi went through a 1.9 km swimming distance with 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
Out of the water, he came in 410th position.
