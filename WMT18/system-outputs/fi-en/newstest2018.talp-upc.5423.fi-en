Camille Auer wanted to correct her sex, was diagnosed as a mental illness and now she is making an art of the subject - "Man should have the right to his own body"
Dozens of patient records are hanging from the roof of the Kuvata Ideas Project room.
Each of them contains the name of Camille Auer.
The papers tell a long story of how external people have written their interpretations of Auser and his identity.
Determined for him who he is.
"I wanted to share my personal care history to make the violence of the process visible," says Auer.
He refers to the process of sexual slavery.
It is often a period of years of research involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process will be initiated through gender-identity diagnosis studies carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had already used the estrogen he had ordered via the Internet and had already been very far into his own repair process.
She felt she was a woman, but according to Finnish law a person has to go through a repair process so that the sex can also be repaired legally.
The Transsex law (563 / 2002) obliges transgender people to undergo compulsory sterilization, i.e. the law on transsek sex fixing, so that the right sex can be acquired, for example, in the population register centre and passport.
At the moment, a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of reproductive inability are required for anyone who corrects their gender.
A person has the right to decide on his or her own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
Finland has been talking about the reform of the Translaw for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight observations on the law and there is a preliminary ruling in the European Court of Human Rights that obliges the parties to the ECHR to respect sovereignty.
Under the leadership of Susanne Huovis, the then Minister for Social Affairs and Health, the previous Finnish Government prepared the amendment of the law.
There were elections and the Peruvian people came into government.
Now the change in the law is again blocked.
These are internal political disputes which are not even related to this particular law.
"The government does not want to put it on the table because there is disagreement within the government about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty Finnish Department.
The front part of the exhibition space is dominated by two major installations.
One consists of packaging and instructions for use of medicines used by Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the Transpol psychology of the Tampere University Hospital in Auter.
The psychologist met Camille Auber twice and, on the basis of these, wrote a report which should determine the right to care and assistance.
The perception of reality being studied is a sign of destabilisation.
The self-perception being studied is fragmented on a cross-border level and the unstable features of personality are highlighted.
Auer did not recognize himself in these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as a mentally ill," says Auer.
The shock was even greater when Auer was not given sex slavery.
According to medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his identity.
On 11 February 2015 - A pilot walked out of the meeting and kicked the waiting board into a television mess.
Later on that television came into being a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflexed his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone born as a woman can magnify their breast, but you need a diagnosis to remove the breast."
Your body is not your own if you feel that you are anything other than the amount of sex determined at birth.
The Auer experience is unfortunately not the only one of its kind.
For many people, the process of debt relief is more difficult for psychological reasons than for purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people who must be justified in their own existence and be entitled to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy for people who are in need of support and help to be denied treatment on the grounds that their resources are not enough," says Auer.
Many people who have applied for the process have psychological symptoms: Depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
For these reasons, the medical staff may prescribe that no treatment can be started.
"Preventing treatment and help can put people in an even worse situation than it was before the start of the process," says Auer.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: "I have had self-destructive thoughts throughout my adult life and that is something that people usually find difficult to digest."
Depression has been treated with medicine, and once Auer started using hormones, it became easier to feel.
He was able to finally say the sensations that had existed from childhood and adolescence.
The reason why the broad jaw did not seem to fit into your own body and why the breast muscles had to be round instead of a steady chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people around him who see him.
Seeing the coming is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using sound and moving," he says.
Nowadays she already feels like coming to see her, she exists as a woman.
At the beginning of the process, however, random comments by those close to you could hurt a lot.
It is most hurt when the close abusers abuse it.
"They should know and they know who I am but they don't agree or can't understand it," he goes on.
However, not all transhuman beings need physical changes.
They do not suffer from bodybuilding, which is a conflict of bodies or parts of the body which can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, there can be no official confirmation of their gender.
"There is no medical justification for these studies," says Auer.
And that's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament approved a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on self-determination in relation to the legal sex.
A adult will submit a written application for a new personal identification code indicating that he or she feels she is of a different sex.
After six months of reflection, the applicant will confirm his application in writing and the Ministry will issue a new personal identification number.
This self-determination is also required in Finland, and this demand is also summed up by the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist; it is a political and artistic collection.
I would like to believe that art still carries weight and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.
The exhibition by Camille Auer on Antihallic Dick from 4 to 28 July 2017 The Project Room of the Academy of Fine Arts.
Citizens' legal order issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National Association for African Civil Liberties, NAACP, has issued a travel warning against Missouri, due to discriminatory practices in the State and racist attacks there.
"The travel information notice for NAACP Missouri comes into force on 28 August 2017 and calls on African American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling in a state which has recently witnessed a number of questionable racial events."
The recent law in Missouri makes it more difficult to export cases of discrimination to the courts, and the implementation of state laws disproportionately affects minorities, which, according to NAACP, led to travel warnings.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are being stopped on the basis of colour and beaten or killed, "Dr Rod Chapel, President of NAACP Missouri, said to Kansas City Star.
"We have not heard so many cases in such a short time before."
The Travel Document for Missouri is the organisation's first warning against the US State.
The organisation cited, for example, the racist comments made against African American students at the University of Missouri and the death of the 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year and was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel. He was arrested by Missouri police although he was not charged with the crime.
The travel information also referred to a report by the Minister of Justice of Missouri that the police were 75% more likely to stop a black driver than a white one.
"The purpose of travel information is to urge people to be on their guard and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People have to prepare, for example, by taking money with them to pay guarantees or telling relatives they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, in Missouri, 100 hate crimes were recorded in 2015, the sixteenth most in the US.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult to sue companies for discrimination in housing and employment.
ACLU, the constitutional organisation, issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona following the adoption of immigration laws that oblige the police to arrest people for immigration offences, which, according to the organisation, will increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concern other countries, but recently they have been published by NGOs in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
YLE: Lintil asked Finnair to report on the supplementary pension scheme of the President and CEO
Mika Lintila (Central) Minister for Public Enterprise, the Government's Minister for the Economy, has asked Finnair to report on the supplementary pension scheme received by the President and CEO Pekka Vauramo, "Yle explains.
According to the Minister, this contradicts the will of the state.
The supplementary pension of EUR 130 000, which has been received by Vauramon, came to light this week when the news from Helsinki about the process of rewarding the directors of listed companies.
In February Finland, Kuvale reported on Vauramon's supplementary pension.
Finnair announced that it would abandon supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has stipulated that supplementary pensions should not be used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's decision in principle on corporate governance.
The sanctions immediately intensified the talks
Not so long ago, it seemed as if relations between the United States and Russia were on a cold-blooded journey.
The US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting in the margins of the G20 meeting in Hamburg, seemed to be well on hand.
Since then, the atmosphere has cool down considerably.
The new economic sanctions adopted by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were met with a bitter response in Russia.
So far, Mr Tyräväv's response has been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who said that the dockyard signed by Trump amounts to a 'full-scale trade war'.
Even if Russian reactions were only reflected in extreme and excessive political rhetoric, the intensification of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after the honeymoon period following the election of the short Trump.
In the United States, the passing of the sanctions list for Russia, Iran and North Korea was not easy.
It is true that the Congress passed the law with remarkable unanimity, but the President found it considerably more difficult to pass the law.
In this respect, Mr Trump criticised the law he recently signed as' significant shortcomings'.
President Trump's fist may have been caused by Russia in particular, although the adoption of a law limiting his own prerogatives must also have been repugnant.
As is well known, an investigation is under way in the United States into both Russia's possible interference in the presidential elections and the Trump campaign on relations with Russia.
The intensification of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short period of time.
When the White House has changed its staff and various scandalous developments have almost been brought up to date, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States under the leadership of the President, but in spite of the President.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is a driving force in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
Not only economic sanctions, but also the tense security situation in the core region of the Union in the Baltic Sea is intensifying relations.
The EU has made a visible case for Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy on Russia, at least on the face of it, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a country like Finland, which trades a lot with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real disaster.
The effects of the recent US sanctions list are still unclear.
The EU has feared that the sanctions will make it more difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and, possibly, in the Fennospower nuclear project.
The acidity of Europe has been caused by the exclusion of, for example, the US economy's important liquid natural gas LNG.
Trade sanctions are a means in world politics of demonstrating indignation.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought out and rigorous.
Otherwise they can easily do more harm than good.
Is nothing more holy?
The White House of Trump now has a statue of Liberty in its sights
Intervention in Pattaya is the surest sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as others: The Iraqis, together with American soldiers, overthrew Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologies of the Trump regime, was well aware of what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN, Jim Acosta.
Miller did not really criticise the statue itself.
If he had done so, he would have attacked a huge crowd of organisers of cruises and characters who imitated the statue of Liberty.
The subject of his attack was the importance of the statue and, in particular, the addition, in 1903, of Emma Lazarus's poem - 17 years after the statue was finished.
I saw Miller radiating from Acosta: "I don't want to go any further into history now, but the statue of freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was added later and does not belong to the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller was not wrong in itself, but it is not just about history, as he himself said.
What is important is the moving words of Lazarus, the only kind in which the state calls not just immigrants, but 'your poor poorest': 'Your tider, your poror, / Your huddled masks yearning to breathe / The search of your store'.
The poem is more topical than ever.
He made it clear that 'the poorest of the poor' are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The dispute over the importance of the liberty barrier is part of a wider political and cultural dispute over the importance of the United States.
After his death, the friends of Lazarus campaigned for the poem to be put from their feet, well aware that it was a deeply political act.
The object of the statue was to express the links between the French and American republicanism with a classic symbolic, feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: In his poem, a female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: The mother of the expelled.
Linking the poem to its image was a brilliant feminist coup d'état and a devastating attack on American nationality.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue and the right has long wanted to turn it back into original.
Rush Limbaugh - a ski who can now be seen as some sort of omen for Trump - claimed in 2010 that the statue of liberty does not present anyone, but is a neoconservative early, which takes the United States to hide behind the dark world.
He takes the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch doesn't show the way to the United States. "
Unusually, Limbaugh was partially right.
The meaning of the statue of liberty depends entirely on perspective.
Lazarus saw it, as the poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the ship after a long and arduous journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people seeking protection and a better life.
His sin of freedom is comforted by hope and welcome.
And that's what Miller and Trump don't want in any case.
Their torch does not show the way, but fuels the flames of hate, their only source of strength.
2017 World Championships in Athletics: Neil Black praises the Scottish Members of the British national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots reached the British national team
Neil Black, the Chief Executive of the British Athletics Association, says that 16 Scottish members of the World Cup team are "significant confirmation."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Championships in Athletics, which will begin in London on Friday.
Mr Blackk says that in Scotland "something special is happening," something that British Athletics has to learn from.
"This is to be welcomed and we will continue to examine it for as long as we understand what it is all about," says Mr Black.
"I talked to representatives of the Scottish Sport Institute and they thought it was related to the activities of the Institute.
The Scottish Athletics Association believes that it is linked to an alliance.
And the British Athletics Association believes that this is behind their actions.
And the ordinary man on the street thinks he has to have something to do with it.
But it's something quite fantastic, and that's why. "
Many Scottish athletes are seriously competing in London for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, competing with Sir Mo Farah for 5 000 metres, while Eilidh Doyle was elected the captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is unnecessarily modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly wonderful, "Black says.
"Athletes left the event proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, wherever they happen to live and train.
In Eilidh's words there was a real feeling and passion for sport. "
Eilidh Doyle is the silver champion of the Commonwealth Championship in the 400 metres hurdles, and these are his fifth World Cup. He thinks it is "incredible" that there are 16 Scots in the national team.
The previous record was seven from 1983 and 2015.
Laura Muir, the world's leading runner, has run for five UK and two European records in the course of the year.
He will compete in London for 1 500 metres and 5 000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1 500 metres in London. It is also worth keeping an eye on him: A man has an excellent season with profits in the World Cup and the Anniversary Games in Great Britain.
Mrs Doyle remembers her first World Cup, when the only score of her national team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "extremely proud" of the fact that there are so many Scots involved, some of whom are really competing for final seats and medals.
"Entry into captain is a great honour anyway, but it is even more special because the members of the national team voted for the captain," says Doyle.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots that got into the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are included as distinguished athletes competing for prizes.
My captain speaking?
I think it went pretty well.
I focused on how fortunate we are to have a home game.
It is important to enjoy the support of the local public and that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere is going to be fantastic. "
Blocking critics on Facebook: Do not stand for public office if you cannot withstand criticism
The father of our country knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticise him for all possible domestic politics, always for his political principles.
The criticism was certainly annoyed,
But he did not silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is abolished, we may be led as stupid and quiet as sheep are slaughtered," Washington said in 1783.
That brings us to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked those who made them.
Mr Hogan was brought to justice by the US League of Citizens' Freedoms earlier this week.
His staff found the challenge unfounded and the online response was also dismissive.
"What does it matter? This is just Facebook," many people commented.
But the issue matters,
Especially in the Hogan case.
Hogan is the remarkably popular Republican Governor of a State ruled by democrats.
He has received the second best estimate of his activities among the 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitized to the heat.
He has led the state firmly and held firm to principles.
He has also competently used Facebook as the main channel for communication with his constituents and has published a picture of what has crept in chemotherapy.
That is why preventing users coming to the Governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous.
Mr Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the actions of the Governor in an interview with Washington Post, saying that it was only a matter of modulating comments.
However, regarding the stigmatisation of commentators as trollets, thus giving or giving rise to hatred is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed Hogan on Facebook to block users.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they had chosen; they were not Trollees, but, for example, teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors.
They told me that their comments were respectful, considerate and objective.
The pastor quoted in his comments to the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
The lawyer, Sarma Ramani Maryland Bowie, was not hostile but asked about hate crimes.
"I commented politely that I am disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crime and other recent news," he wrote in the remarks in Washington Post.
"I also find it unacceptable that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately seen as some sort of organised group and are ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The Governor's staff called the comments a "concerted attack," someone else could call them in order to advance matters considered to be important.
In the Facebook era, communication is easy to manage by preventing a critic or removing a critical comment.
In the past, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorial reports or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But it is really the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of shattering Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have taken him to court.
A first major decision was taken last week in Virginia.
According to James C. Cacheriks, Judge at the district court in Alexandria, the government of Loudoun violated the first increase in the US constitution by preventing the voter from being elected on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Union went to discuss the use of Twitter and Facebook with the Republican Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin.
This should not be difficult.
At the time in Washington, low-cost postal charges had the same effect as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers has quadrupled, and anonymous authors are crawling in Washington.
Even then there were trollees.
Nimimekerit Yuricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to the newspapers barking at the decisions of Washington.
The presidential office was inundated with petitions criticising the Jay Agreement, the United States-Britain Cooperation, Trade and Shipping Pact, as shown by documents collected by the Papers of George Washington Network Project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the foundations of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
Summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about one and a half dozen places, and there are also emails on the web from a couple, three.
Most of them have come from southern and southern Finland, but then also from the individual Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, according to the special engineer, Marja Isomursu Evira.
The Viherpepot have died in a parasitic disease called trikomori.
It is caused by the animal of origin known as Trichomonas gallinae.
It has been known in the past that it hits the doves, and especially the powder.
In the 21st century, however, the disease was also detected in some form of powdered bird.
In 2009, we ran very well.
At that time, the tricomone caused a big collapse in the green-collar stock in Finland, and the species has been recovering.
There have now been sick green finch, but not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, the museum's Museum of Natural History of the University of Helsinki.
It is to be feared that the last epidemic of green finch will be repeated unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: Stop the summer feeding of birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home base at the Renaissance Club
Ronan Rafferty, a former leading European player, hopes to benefit from the home ground for the next three days, while the Renaissance Club East Lothian is hosting the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
In the run-up to the final round, Rafferty, a Northern Irishman, led last year to a tournament in neighbouring Archherfield links, but eventually lost to Paul Eales.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will reach its full glory," Rafferty says.
"Players see the field at its best. It's in a great condition.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He is an enthusiastic ambassador in the game and he is proud of his achievements here.
The tournament is a great showcase for this field. "
English Eales will defend the championship for the first time, even though he has won a 32-year career tour of Europe and a challenging tour of Europe.
"This seems a very special opportunity," says a player in Southport.
"I was unable to defend my victory at Extremadura Open because the tournament is not on a tour this year.
It is wonderful to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories remind me: The tournament initiative was wonderful for me and my wife, Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember. "
Gary Orr returns to a real job on his own soil. He went on a tour earlier this year, when he was fifty years old.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing in the region is always more important than usual," says Orr, living in Helensburg.
"You want to succeed but you also feel extra pressure.
I enjoyed playing again and played quite strongly.
I am happy with my game so far. "
The trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnami and senior players Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots take part in the tournament: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmundir and Ross Drummond.
The tournament is free to enter. Car parking costs five pounds if the car only has a driver, and GBP 10 if the car has at least two people.
All profits are donated to the Prosta Cancer UK cancer organisation.
In the Särkylä, the problem of indoor air pollution was examined.
As yet, indoor air problems have not been discovered in the barracks of the Pori Brigade, at least not yet, and the Brigade was announced on Thursday.
Internal investigations are still ongoing.
The investigations began when a man who interrupted his military service for health reasons thought that his health had been undermined by the poor indoor air quality of the barracks.
According to Mayor of Pori Brigade, Colonel Mika Holman, no problems have been identified in the health situation of other military personnel.
It turned out that this was an isolated case and there were no health problems for those who served in the service.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this issue in detail.
It is not known at the moment that we have any indoor air problem, "Mr Holma says.
The press release of the Brigade states that due to the arrival time in July, the cartridges had to be transferred to the barracks, which has allowed the dust to increase temporarily.
The aircraft may have seemed very heavy as a result, "says Holma.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Golden Country
Bardina Degei does not use hell in the cooking.
Even the ceiling is rarely used.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai region, which is located in Indonesia's restless province of Papua. When he produces dinner, he usually puts the batate - locally "not" - directly into a fireplace.
After half an hour, the battery, which is burnt to the bear, is eaten greed by the bare, unwashed hands.
In Degei's home there are no furniture. He is sitting in a muddy painting, where he usually also takes care of the daily ascites, such as washing from close salt in the same water.
The office of the toilet will be supplied by the bucket in a non-ceiling room.
Degei is his youngest husband of four wives, and he has not been appointed to care for fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: Most of the men in the village are unemployed and many drink a lot, and the soldiers must be taken into account.
"No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening," Degei says.
This is a rare throat in the Highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was annexed to Indonesia in 1969.
The local independence movement, which opposed the Dutch regime, quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta Government, which is holding the region under strict control and preventing foreign journalists and human rights observers from getting there.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
The trip starts with an hour and a half on a flight from the province's capital Jayapura to Nabiree, and continues with the stomach wring during a five-hour drive on a rented car.
There is no public transport here.
In a city of about 19 000 inhabitants, there are trees surrounded by bamboo plants, and the rust of corrugated fields has been recruited as basements.
Only a few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the people of Papua Mee Pago worship the Uga Tamee.
Other changes have taken place.
"We didn't have such clothes," Degei says.
"Before we had only leaves to cover our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, with 28% of the inhabitants living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy among the highest in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's golden land.
Paniai is approximately the Highland region of New Jersey, with 153 000 inhabitants.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper to Freetown.
In addition, Papua has an estimated timber reserves of USD 78 billion.
For the Papuan people, however, these riches bring misery because they mean the suffocating presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid nearly USD 20 million to local military personnel and local units of the army between 1998 and 2004. Individual officers received up to USD 150 000.
Papua's demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income and are mercilessly silenced.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 clergy and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the upper hills of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s were on a scale of genocide.
Last year, over 3 900 people were arrested by the Indonesian police in the area during peaceful demonstrations.
The report of the Archdiocese of Brisbane, We Will Lose Everything from 2016, contains reports of the atrocities of the previous year, such as extrajudicial killings, torture - rape and electronic bags are particularly popular - and ruthless attacks on peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are cases every week," says Andreas Harson, Indonesian scientist at Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been tightened as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but the population structure is changing as the people of Indonesia move from the islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi to the region in the hope of a better living.
The Javanese warung stalls sell baked chicken and gado-gado vegetable mix in the peanuts.
It is difficult for the locals to compete.
"Migrants have started to sell chicken and vegetables in the market at a lower cost than the local ones," says Abeth You, 24-year-old, who comes from Panama and moved to the provincial capital for work.
"Local women lost their customers."
In his 2014 election campaign, the President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, his favourite name, Jokowi, promised to address the injustices of Papua and human rights violations.
Papua is made up of 29 regions and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Paniai, on his way to the President of Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and we expected him to fulfil our hopes and restore justice," you say.
At Paniai, only two months after the inauguration of Jokow in October, there was some kind of grounding.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs at the campfire in Enarotali on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use headlights.
According to the local pastor Yavett Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and the witnesses, the children were captured and beaten by drunk soldiers.
In this way, one of the soldiers shot every child.
One of the children, Yuulianus Yeheimo, aged 16, fell apart as a result of ill-treatment.
A few hours later, the building of the State Election Commission, which was close to the scene, was set on fire, and the next day it started to happen.
About a thousand clergy - young men, women and children - gathered on the football field for a local police station and a military command centre to demand justice.
They had hunting springs with their expenses, and they started to show the traditional wata dance of Papua's Mee Pago, where they were dancing around and imitating the bird.
Some of the demonstrators began to stole police and army buildings.
When the atmosphere warmed, the military received the commandment in the internal radio system: 'If the masses resist more than three times, shoot them to death'.
Yeeremias Kayame, 56, the head of population of the Kego Koto region, anticipated that the situation would get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and to return to their homes.
Nobody wanted to listen any more.
"When I turned around, I was shot on the left coast," he told the TIME newspaper with a whisper of his bright-coloured tree.
Kayame still does not know who shot him, but the pilot came from the ranks of the soldiers.
"Several shots were fired at Väntung."
Alfius Youwia was shot three times. His cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really he," told Yohannes TIME with sadness. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... kissed him."
Yotje Mende, the police inspector in Papua, told journalists that the police only "protected" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Pudjo Sullistyo, spokesman of the Papuan police force, said in 2015.
"Then it's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many injured.
The next day, the knowledge of the grief reached Jakarta.
Three weeks later, in Jayapura, Jokowi made an emotional speech expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising that the Papua violence would be addressed.
"I want this case to be investigated immediately so that it never happens again."
In October 2016, the Minister for Security, Mr Wiranto, said that he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the justice system.
However, he immediately began to withdraw his words.
"Most infringements took place long ago,
The 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate infringements, but that requires certain processes, "he said.
In an interview with the time magazine Jakarta, 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he did not intend to start a survey on Papua.
"Everything is settled in court," he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity." The crimes relate to the deaths of over a thousand people in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999.
The families of the victims of the Paniai are bitterly sceptical about these claims.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," Yohnes says.
"I'm already tired of this."
He tells us that he is still living in fear, even though the event has been going on for years.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid I'm being arrested by the military. I'm afraid I'm being shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the panic will not dare to discuss the event.
He says that the soldiers had mistreated him when he had helped bury four victims.
"The soldiers are looking at me after the burial of the victims," he says.
The amputations are not over.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in the Paniai neighbouring Deiyai region.
One died and 17 was injured in the conflict between the villagers and the head of the building company, which began when the director refused to take a unconscious man to hospital, including children.
A man who needed hospitalization was a 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had had to rely on water while fishing on a nearby river, and he died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers demonstrated on a construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
According to the local authorities, however, the mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitaries opened fire to the crowd, and one villager was killed.
"We're afraid of revenge," says the 29-year-old Domingu Badi, who lives near the hospital and saw when the wounded were brought to care.
"I have been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called the policemen who fired their bags to account and the mobile police unit to be removed from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of real development feeds discontent in the Mee, the multi-ethnic, the Dani and the Damal tribes living in the Vepsian valleys in the central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the OPM, the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of the clergy through random attacks and the kidnapping of Indonesian military personnel.
Some of the leaders of OPM are from Paniai, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The military has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Panama in the name of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some of the detainees will never return.
Among the priests, Paniai is known as "a sad, forgotten place."
Poverty fuels dissatisfaction.
There is little rice for sale in Enarotali, and that too is too expensive for the locals,
Like bread.
People grow their food themselves: Mainly batates and some fruit and vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, and one woman can be responsible for four or five batical fields.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the rest is sold at the market.
Ten batates cost only 10 000 roubles (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the livelihoods of local people and migrants have increased and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes at Nabire airport.
There are few jobs and they tend to go to better-trained and wealthier migrants at local level.
Only a few priests have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own business in a competitive way.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work and no money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
The peripheral Papua will be ignored by the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news are still severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escuded and Basile Longchamp were expelled from Papua despite having been granted a rare description permit, the official reason being their inability to cooperate with local institutions.
Pheelim Kinen, Asia's Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, says that Jokowi has not kept his election promises; he has not increased transparency and promoted development by removing restrictions on news reporting.
"There are new risks for journalists reporting on Papua, Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces, and West Papua: Refusal of visas and blacklisting," said Kine in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian Government is under pressure only from its immediate neighbours in Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the 'numerous and widespread violations' of Papua, including the amputation of Panama.
These countries have also traditionally supported the Papuan liberation movement.
The Indonesian Foreign Office spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir, denied the allegations and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia remains a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to conceal evidence of human rights violations."
The locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When an official delegation from Holland, led by the human rights envoy, Kees Van bar, visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, the local authorities broken the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, the anonymous source of the meeting was there.
There are presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019, but the clergy tell us that they are no longer likely to vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who are caught up in the firing line of the Paniai," says the chairman of the tribal council, Gobai.
He wants Jokowin to know the situation of the panic people: They live under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army in deprivation and poverty, virtually without access to health care and education.
According to Gobai, the voices it gives to Jokowi, like other priests, are regarded as a "debt" that must be paid back.
"They don't want money. They just want justice," he says.
In spite of intimidation and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting attack once again symbolically demonstrated resistance: They buried one of the victims in a police station and an army office in the opposite country.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they do not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"My family members were killed," says Yacobus in his head.
"What else can we do?"
Derek Chisora is barking at the cancellation of Robert Helenius's renegotiation of the match: "Not even your own fans want to see"
The heavy series of boxers, Robert Helenius and Derock Chisoran, was due to take place on 27 May in the Hartwall arena.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora has fully rolled over the baton of the flop from the flop to the shoulders of Helenius.
In Finland I took a flop but it was not my fault.
I do not live in Finland, I do not want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see his grasp because he's miserable, Chisora rude.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in a full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Hellenius won the match with a controversial score.
The sales of tickets for the match went smoothly and in May, the propulsion Nisse Sauderland told Ilta-Sanomat that the match had been postponed until the autumn.
There has been nothing new about the match.
However, Chisora is no longer annoyed.
The match would probably have to be cancelled anyway after Chisora was ill.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I awoke to severe pain.
Tyräni was about to explode.
The hospital said that I should be cut, "Chisora says.
The British are now saying that they are in about 45% shape.
He is not interested in a repeat match with Helenius, but the aim is Dillian Whte.
Chisora suffered Whale's defeat in December with a split vote.
Again came the Torch skyscraper in Dubai
The flames invaded one of the world's highest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of inhabitants were forced to flee 337 metres from the high 79 floor building.
This was the second fire in two years in a building which happens to be called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied and no one is known to have been injured.
"We were sleeping and woke up the fire alarm aloud and to people's cries.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes, "the resident of George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai rescue services, the fire was extinguished at four o'clock in the morning and the building was frozen.
The government announced that it would provide accommodation for those who had left their homes.
This case may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used in the outer coating of high buildings around the world.
Following the fire in 2015, a study was commissioned by the board of the Torch building, which found out that the hardest hit were those on cover-up and insulation disks.
In Britain, the police believe that the solitary confinement in Grenelle Tower in London could help the flames to quickly rise to a fire where 80 people died in June.
Moped was stolen from Joensuu Airport during the night
A moped was stolen from the parking lot in Joensuu between 9 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Wednesday.
The moped disappeared from Niinivaara from Tikkamäentie 2.
The moped was by nature the Sky Team Monkey.
In colour it is red, and the registration number is 27-REV.
The moped was found later on Thursday.
The police will request observations of the molten or its seizure by email to this email address, which is protected from spambots.
You will need a JavaScript grant to see it. or by telephone on call number 0295 415 320.
Edited on 3 August 2017 at 12.40: 00: The police reported that the moped had been found.
In the US, more than 20% of air passengers take items banned on board, reveals survey
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unaware of the use of banned items by the US Road Safety Agency (TSA) screening points.
Less than 1% said that they had only learned afterwards that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey was carried out by a charter company Stratos Jet Charters, with more than a thousand passengers responding to it. The results also show that young passengers are more likely to flout the rules.
19.7% of the travellers who knowingly breached the rules of the TSA were of the Y generation and less than 15% were of the X-generation.
The most common rules were broken by taking food and liquids on board.
More than 3% said they had deliberately taken steel items on board; 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men said they had deliberately taken banned pharmaceutical substances on board.
The survey was carried out by passengers from all over the United States. The company, which carried out the survey, wanted to find out how many had accidentally passed the security check and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that those who travel most are also more likely to take the smuggling equipment away from the security check - consciously or unwittingly.
But as the company that made the survey finds, the TSA's instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids to take on board an aircraft and how much.
It is therefore no surprise that most of the seizures of TSA are liquids.
For some time there was also the belief that no books could be taken on board an aircraft.
Liquids may be taken for domestic flights but not for international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, jumped its decision to delay Obama's decisions to reduce emissions
The day after the 15 states had referred the Director of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Prutin, to the Court of Justice, the former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's decisions to reduce smoky emissions.
According to Prutin, this change shows that the Agency under his leadership takes better account of the needs of the state's environmental decision-makers.
The Pruit did not say a word about the case against his earlier decision before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The Länder should start complying with the 2015 level of ground level ozone as from 1 October.
In June, Pruut announced that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions for one year in order for his agency to have more time to examine the plan, as the agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth."
Prudit was the Public Prosecutor of the State of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him Director of the EPA. Prudit is known as an opponent of stricter environmental rules.
Since its arrival in Washington, Prutte has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of the decisions taken against the chemical industry and industries using fossil fuels.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback to the Prutti plan to relax its rules.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA exceeded his powers in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama Administration's decision on oil and gas companies, which obliged them to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In the opinion delivered on Wednesday evening, Prudit argued that his U-turn on the ozone regulations would only strengthen EPA cooperation with the Länder in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements in time.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then expected activists and others to challenge them to reach an agreement on timetables," said Prutti.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it gives us. "
However, the EPA's opinion concluded that Pruitt could continue to use its "powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and are based on the best available information."
The Republicans are pushing for a broader change in the provisions on ozone in Congress.
The legislative initiative adopted last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted by the Senate.
Eric Schneidderman, the Public Prosecutor of the State Union of New York, who chaired this week's State Coalition for Justice, said that the group intended to keep up the pressure.
"The change of mind of the EPA as a result of our actions is a major victory for the 6.7 million New York citizens and over 115 million Americans exposed in their communities to the direct effects of smog."
In addition to New York, the action included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Verona, Verstricton the City of Washington.
Ground-level ozone is created when emissions from, for example, cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical factories react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause severe breathing problems for sensitive groups of people, and is also a contributing factor to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists welcomed the surprising change of direction by Prutti.
"It is worrying how much pressure was brought to bear to ensure that common sense was used by a friend in the air we breathe," says Lori Ann Burd Biodiversity Centre.
"We must continue to fight the Trump regime, which has the ideological aim of acting on the terms of polluters and other self-serving groups."
The Supercar manufacturer is becoming a street "Ferrari style"
It will also invest in hybrid sports cars, while maintaining its exclusive status.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari's style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said about the plans at a briefing session on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year, when the Italian supercar manufacturer will present its new five-year plan, the Automotive News will report.
All Eastern Savonia cases of the same type of virus
Rantasalmi's measles disease is the same type of virus as the previous cases of East Savo, notified THL.
On Thursday, the Institute of Health and Welfare's Estonian Laboratory has ensured that East Savo's fifth measles disease is the same viral strain as earlier infections.
THL has ensured that the measles outbreak confirmed on Friday 28 July is the same type of virus as the previous cases of Eastern Savo.
On the basis of this information, all the infections detected in East Savo relate to the first measles identified in the region in June.
This is good news, because it means that we have not seen any other types of measles cartilage.
It is possible, however, that new infections may occur between mid-August and so the epidemic is not over, says Mirkalena Erkkilä, the doctor responsible for basic health care in Soter.
New measles art or doubts have not emerged since the fifth confirmed case.
It is still important, however, that everyone takes care of the timeliness of their own vaccination policy, "Mr Erkkilä points out.
More on the subject: Pirkanmaa was confirmed by three new measles of measles - "Liss or epidemic very unlikely"
Finland is preparing for a licensed shield
Pontica's soup was not even considered for legalisation.
The underlying reason that the process produces the wine along with methanol, which is toxic.
It is lawful to produce Kilju at home next year, but to legalise the pony soup is not even considered.
It is manufactured by fermentation, and by distillation.
Behind the regulation of distillation lies the argument that the process produces methanol alongside wine, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to impose an all-out cooking right, comments from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health were made by the government adviser Ismo Tuominen.
When the Ministry was preparing a reform of the alcohol law, pontificate distillation was not considered to be legalised.
Nor was it put on the political table.
There was no debate on the release of distilleries, says Outi Mäkelä (Coke).
He is at the negotiating table of the parliamentary groups of the governing parties, who took a position on the reform of the alcohol law.
Even in the future, it will not even be possible to grant permission for distillation of pontificate at home.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain licensed.
Importing says that the home production of alcoholic beverages becomes a simple rule: Alcohol may be produced by fermentation at home.
This means that it is now possible to make a legal film in addition to beer, cider and wine at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements for flavourings and allows the manufacture of a film, the specification.
The manufacture must still be carried out in such a way that the raw materials, or the flavouring substances created in connection with their fermentation, are clearly visible in the drink.
According to the new law, beverages can be prepared for themselves as much as they like, and alcohol of their own kind can be given as a gift.
It is still not allowed to be sold.
The act of Kilju is no longer a public health problem in Finland, "Tuominen believes.
A much greater change occurred in 2004, when the passenger room was released from Estonia and other EU countries.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The Alcohol Law proposal is now being examined by the Ministry of Justice.
The legislation on alcohol will come before the Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament has already taken a stand, Mäkelä is glad.
Oscar Pistorius was sent to hospital with armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, a victim of crime, was climbed to a South African hospital because of heart attacks.
Pistorius has already got out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving in prison in Attiridgeville.
According to the British newspaper Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning, accompanied by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered chest pain but he got out of the hospital in the afternoon.
The prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to hospital for investigations.
As far as the spokesman of the family of Pisstorius is concerned, the former top sportsman is in good condition.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced the six-year gold medal winner of the Paralympic Paralympics to six years in prison for the murder of her girlfriend, Reeva Steenkam.
Pistorius shot Steenkampi in February 2013.
If you look at the Litted Telephone talks, you will see Trump putting pressure on Mexico to build a border barrier.
Litres of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and Mexican leaders and Australia have been leaked to Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on 27 January 2017, Trump called on the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto end his public speech that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border barrier.
The President of the United States ransomed Nieto the effect that he had killed a wall project in public. "You can't say that to the press," Mr Trump said.
Mr Trump began his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also published a literation of the first call from Trump to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and there was an intense exchange of views during the call.
Mr Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement whereby the United States would take refugees on their way to Australia was' ridiculous', 'miserable' and 'stupid'.
Trump ended the call by saying to Turnbull: 'This was the most unpleasant call all day'.
Georgian massacre: Activists re-stage racist lynching in law
A car of Ford Mercury bypasses a crowd in the small town of Monroe in the countryside of Georgia and continues its journey towards a small Moore's Ford bridge.
The car has four black passengers and a white driver.
A leader of a group, a middle-aged man wearing a rail dress, takes a deep breath of his pig and walks through a windscreen.
Passengers are afraid.
"Roger, n---u!" The man of man.
"Out of the car!"
The lips break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a rearguard action, which was performed on 22 July 2017.
The sighs of shock, however, are genuine when the noose around the neck of the "Roger."
Since 2005, human rights organisations have been returning to the bridge of Moore's Ford to rebuild the events of 1946, when Ku Klux Klan lynkhs two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey Dorsey Dorsey Dorsey.
No one has been prosecuted for murder.
"It's puzzling that no one has been arrested in these years - although the murderers live amongst us and many have to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who help with the re-engineering.
"It is a disgrace of history, but above all it is a burden that weighs our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and a former Georgian congress representative.
It reminds the people of Monroe that the injustice has never been done.
"We want the guilty to be brought to justice. We want to see things finally brought to an end and we want to recover from grief and reconciliation, but above all we want justice," says Mr Brooks.
"We cannot recover and settle until we get justice."
On 27 July 1946, the body of the victim who died in a bloodbath in Georgia is covered by an eye-catching scientist.
According to the FBC press reports, over 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
However, no one was accused of murder.
Although the perpetrators have been at large for decades, the activists say that the motives for lynching have always been locally known: Politics and sex.
In 1946 the black people in the State of Georgia were given the Supreme Court's decision to vote for the first time in the presidential elections. The Supreme Court made its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, at the time of the elections, an incident occurred in which the black tenant Roger Malcom stabbed the white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a killing apparently involving Malcom's wife Dorothy.
It was rumoured in the city, according to Brox, that Hester had a relationship with Dorothyn and that Dorothy was waiting for this child.
According to FBI data, the influential white landowner, Loy Harrison, paid on 25 July 1946 Malcom's 600 dollar guarantees, against which he was released from prison.
Their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey were on their way home.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and ordered murders," says the FBI report.
"It is also evident that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities, which were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Mr Brooks puts it more succinctly.
"That was the death of the voter," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to signal to the black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the massacre in Georgia for almost a decade.
This is an extremely realistic and imprisonable act, a description of the appalling racism that many would like to believe has disappeared from today's United States.
It is hard to see but even harder not to see what Green thinks is the intention.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because we would have to face our dark sides," says the director.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've experienced."
This year's exercise began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors - ten black and twenty white - gathered to hear the routine summary of Greene's presentation.
Wade Marbaugh is the assistant director of Green.
He has been putting forward for years the head of the local Ku Klux Klan in the recast, but the role is always equally difficult and repulsive.
"There will be a dirty feeling, because I am not myself," Marbaugh says.
"However, it is important that this aspect of history is also raised so that it never happens again."
On the other side of the room, the applications are by Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, or Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The performance begins with a scene where Malcom cries and cries out to Hester. He is outraged that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothy.
"Did you not hear? I said, leave my land, I--u!"
Rascona, or Hester, answers.
Then goes the beat.
And then everything (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Green laughs the hardest.
"What?!" Rascona asks.
He is confused.
"Did I accidentally travel too fast?" He asks.
"No," Greene hedges.
"I just don't think the white used the word" n "--u."
"So," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang. You have to use a longer version."
The subject matter of the presentation is unpleasant, but the room's power is the friendship spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the sake of the motion; they want to pay tribute to the memory of those who died.
The scene starts from scratch.
Now it is the words of Rascona that are not good.
No one is laughing.
The post-mortem ends quickly and violently.
Cry, shots - and silence.
A woman wearing a black funeral dress stands beside the bodies and sings the song Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice is broken every second word.
A few ten metres away, fifty viewers are sweeping away some sweat and tears.
Almost exactly half of the audience is black and half white.
There is a couple who have come to see the motion from the state of Ithaca in New York, but most are local.
They have visited the graves of the victims in the oppressive Georgian revenge, under the guidance of Mr Brox.
The murders have turned the story into reality. The atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the submission, Greene calls a crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children get to see artificial blood and immobile bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mutes like to remind himself.
In a few minutes Mrs Green will thank the public.
The actors who have been putting the finishing touches are pulling the strings and sweeping the tears.
BRADSHAW hugh, a man who presented the local leader of Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugged two actors and then breaks out after a cynical show.
"No problem," the woman in the show comforts.
"We know that you're not him.
You did this for good reason. "
Later the public and actors will meet for a common dinner.
The white couple arriving from Altanta will have a lively exchange of views with the black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplokin found it hard to find words when he describes the feelings aroused by the performance.
"It's hard to listen to horrible words and watch the awful deeds that are said and done by people who look like you - just because they look like you," he says.
"This performance made me realise that lynching is still going on," he added. "They are simply called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks refers to the development of civil rights for listeners at the same table.
He says that he has already started planning for next year's proposal.
"A resistor is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also an educational experience," Brooks says.
"Its message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it. "
There is a great deal of commotion among the shops: The removal of these "spare parts" will actually save money.
Is it permitted to remove the flower leaves in the shop before weighing them up?
What about taking the big hat out of the pineapple - it weighs how much?
The answers are very much in dispute: For some it is a sign of a degree of snuff, for others it is unwilling to pay for those parts of the vegetables that are not used and yet go back to the dustbin.
The phenomenon is recognised in shops.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket department in Ruoholahti, Helsinki, because many people tear out the flower leaves, for example.
From the box the leaves are sold for bio-waste.
According to the news published by the economists, the cudgels on the vegetable counter surprise traders.
But how much does it really save money to remove the extra parts of vegetables before weighing them up?
How important is this game of thumb really?
We women tested how the price changes when it comes to pineapple, floral, delicacy, broccoli and flower pots taking leaves or positions away.
The flower box: The purse of EUR 2.10 had a price of EUR 1.80 when all the leaves had to be removed from it.
Ananas: The price of a total anak costing EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its stock was twisted off.
Latva Artishock: The price of EUR 2.60 came to EUR 2.40 as the short stock was cut off.
Mushrooms: Two delicacies cost a total of 75 cents.
Without positions the price came to 60 cents.
Parsakal: A medium-sized bear has cost 1 euro and has no bearing of 80 cents.
The result: If you go off the lap, you can save a few dozen cents for one vegetables at best.
In percentage terms, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20%.
A total of EUR 1.20 would have been saved from these purchases!
Neyman was bought out of Barcelona - the brand star signed a five-year contract with PSG
Neyman, a Brazilian star, has signed a five-year contract with PSG, according to the news agency AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neyman representatives had paid a buy-out price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, a football player in the Spanish league.
The huge transfer of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was in Manchester United, which paid out EUR 105 million last summer from France, Paul Pogba.
The Spanish League blocked the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neyman representatives' first payment attempt.
According to the league rules, a club buying can't pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player has to buy out his contract, which happens by recycling money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the money to Neyman and their representatives who supplied the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neyman is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He may be presented to a new home audience at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA will examine the details
Barcelona also announced in its information note that it would issue a fee to the European Football Association Uefa to enable the Association to determine any disciplinary action that might result from the incident.
Among others, Javier Tebas, the President of the Spanish League, has suspected that the PSG is breaking the rules of fair economic play of Uefa in its spending.
UEFA can punish the company, which is making a loss of more than EUR 30 million over three years.
UEFA says that the transfer of Neyman does not automatically violate its economic rules.
The transfer of Neyman to PSG affects the club's economy for many years, but the impact cannot be assessed beforehand.
For example, the PSG could sell several players at substantial sums, and UEFA was informed.
PSG is owned by the state-owned company Qatar Sports Investment.
The church is chaired by Nasser al-Khelaifi, a former tennis man.

Austin, 21, was injured by severe fire injuries from a lightning attack - the stigma was stored as an airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing ordinary work on the plane at the Southwest Florida International Airport with a couple of colleagues who were suddenly struck by a flash in the sky.
The force of the salaman threw the wings of the machine into the country of Dunnin, which is close to it.
Dunn was rushed to hospital.
He had a third degree of burns around his body.
My father called me and said that the brother got electronic and he is in hospital.
I just asked if he is alive, "Austin's sister Auumn says.
Austin spent two weeks there.
In addition to burns, he had musculoskeletal damage and bleeding.
It was a tough experience for the whole family.
No such thing to expect.
It's traumatised for everyone, "says Auumn.
According to the airport representative, the salamarisk alert system was on site at the time of the incident and the transport operator itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3,000 jobs and stimulates business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British training group Pearson announced that he would cut 3 000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% by launching a new restructuring programme in response to pressure on his business.
According to the CEO, John Fallon, the reduction in jobs will mainly take place at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019.
In May, Pearson announced that he would cut costs again by GBP 300 million as part of his third austerity programme to revive a weakened business as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell his share of the Penguin Random House to his partner Bertelsmann, who announced that it would maintain this year's outlook, a turnover of 1% and 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of this year.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
The suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, which, according to the authorities, killed a NATO soldier and injured many others.
According to a NATO statement, five soldiers and interpreters were injured in the attack.
According to unsubstantiated local data, three civilians also died in the attack on the territory of Kabul in Qarabagh.
The explosion is the most recent violent attack in Afghanistan this month, with 30 deaths in a mosque explosion in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, two people died in a suicide bomber's attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, the explosion on Thursday night occurred when the joint patrols of NATO and the Afghan army fell victim to an attack carried out by a 'person carrying a personal explosive device'.
The opinion reported that all the injured persons were in stable condition and treated at the US military hospital in Bagram.
According to correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of an ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are significant concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1 662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people were killed by a car bomb in a suicide attack in Kabul, a region where Shi'ite Muslims mainly live.
The Taliban declared that they were behind the attack.
On the last of May, more than 150 people died in the bomb attack in the centre of Kabul, which was the attack by the country's most destructive militant bloc since the US-led forces overthrown the Taliban in 2001.
The violence underlines the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump considers whether the United States will deploy additional troops to assist the local army and the police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, in its policies and, in particular, in President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA reverses its decision to postpone the implementation of the smoke smoking rules
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) jumped its decision to delay the implementation of the Obama Administration's decisions to reduce smoky emissions a day after 15 states had taken the Agency to court.
The EPA announced its decision on the late implementation of the 2015 so-called "ozone definitions" on Wednesday, which, according to the agency, demonstrates its commitment to cooperation with the Länder.
"We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the Länder," said Scott Pruut in the opinion of the Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year from October 2018. The definitions indicate that the smog rate will be measured in certain parts of the country in order to determine where pollution must be reduced according to more stringent air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the Agency brought to justice 15 predominantly democratic states, including the District of Columbia, which found it illegal to postpone implementation.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought ways of mitigating the environmental rules introduced by Barack Obama and, according to Trump, these measures are part of a broader programme of economic growth.
The Trump measures have been opposed by democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to the EPA website, 'inhaling ozone-containing air' can weaken lung activity and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a leading figure in Isis also sending building blocks to Sydney.
There were suspicions that the bomb was to be taken to an aircraft on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police do not specify why the company was interrupted.
Another of the suspected terrorists' plans was to build a device for transporting toxic, colourless gas and to transport it to a public place of overcrowding, such as a public transport vehicle.
Michael Phelan, Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Because of suspected terrorist plans, four men were detained in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will also continue.
Liquid CEO: Renewable fuels did well
The oil processor Neste's result before the tax fell but paid the forecasts for the second quarter.
According to the CEO, Matti Lievosen, the company achieved a good result in oil products, sales volumes of renewable products increased to a record level and the business profits of the Marketing & Services segment were moving in the right direction.
Last year, comparable business profits were improved by the US Blender Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Mr Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will complete the strategic investments we announced earlier in 2017, "said Lievonen in the communiqué.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomchenko discuss a possible match at their first meeting
On Thursday, Vasyl Lomatchenko and Mike Garcia, who are supposed to be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future, met each other for the first time.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel in Los Angeles until the winner of the WBC, Mikey Garcia, walked along the corridor to greet Lomathhenko, the lower house of WBO.
On Saturday, Garcia won the former four-weight world champion Adrien Bronner with the unanimous decision of the Showtime, and since then Garcia and Lomathenko have been among the top five weight-class boxers on a comparative list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and asked, "How is it, master?
Good luck with the match! "
Mr Lomakhenko is defending his title against Miguel Marriagas on ESPN's seven Saturday.
When the two poachers for photographers, Lomathenko's manager Egis Klima pointed out that a match between men would be "perfect in terms of size."
"I'm a former feather, Garcia reminded us.
"I went beyond the series [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not so big.
I am small to 63.5 kilos.
I want to go back to the light weight.
He must rise in a light weight [61.2 kg]. Then we can take hold.
That is what our fans are hoping for.
Let their hope be fulfilled. "
Lomatshenko was of the same opinion.
"Boxing needs this match."
Mrs Klimas asked whether the match should be organised using a payment channel, which is part of her strategy for Lomatchenko towards Lomathenko debut in a series later this year and will hold a light in Garcia this summer against the 37-0, 30 shooting games.
"The match could be on the payment channel, because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that it was ready to grab the channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
Nobody else is attracting as much attention.
As soon as an agreement is reached, it suits me... "
Garcia said that he appreciated Lomathhenko as an "incredible hold-up" and that he might be going to see Saturday's match.
Lomatshenko interrupted the praise of the Garcia goat and said that this master of the three weights from Rivers seemed to be "really slow. Sori, Mike... but needed a knock-out."
Garcia said that it was focusing first on showing the power of the attack and then on boxing.
The men said they felt they wanted the match to be played more and more.
"This is the game that is expected.
No other match will attract as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case, "Garcia said.
Lomatshenko said he expected to get hold of the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It will be a great match. "
Average salary €5 300, training what happens - the situation of investment advisory services was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been much talked about recently.
Most recently, in Helsinki, Sanomat told of Ritva, 68, to whom the investment advice of the banking group was talking about a complete bottle of investment products.
The rules on investment advisers and the sale of various investment products will become stricter at the beginning of next year.
The tightening up will be based on the new Markets Directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the competence of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is based mainly on self-regulation.
The law does not define competence requirements.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment services carry out their own APV1 or APV2 qualification.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of qualifications for a company called APV Investment Studies Oy, whose work group consists of experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiav), universities and industry.
The degrees are 12-15 credits and their exams are compiled by Aalto EE, the Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides business management development services.
In general, both exams are "quite extensive in terms of requirements."
The educational materials for qualifications include 10-15 books and a large number of other guides and works.
Markku savikko, CEO of APV Investment Investigation Ltd, tells us that the percentage of the exams is roughly estimated at 70.
Of the staff of the largest banks, more or less all those providing investment services have completed either APV1 or APV2 because they are compulsory under their own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers without mentioning the names, whose staff seem to have avoided completing their qualifications, "says the clay.
According to him, there are "few" bankers.
According to Mr Saviko, APV1 has completed between 13 000 and 14 000 graduates since 2000 and approximately 3 000 more demanding APV2 qualifications recommended for investment advisers.
Some bankers consider it an advantage to complete a qualification.
Several other industries have significantly stricter knowledge requirements.
The savoir says that a recommendation in the field of finance requires that the APV qualifications be completed, because it is in that way that investment expertise is ensured.
According to the Statistical Centre, financial and investment advisers earn on average several thousand euros per month, including commissions, benefits in kind and income premiums.
The average earnings of monthly wage earners are approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men employed work for more than EUR 5 900 a month and women earn more than EUR 4 500.
On average, the top ten earn about EUR 8 100.
A tenth of the ten-year-old men who earn the most earn more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, a tenth of the women who earn the most, earn EUR 6 400 or more.
Only a licensed company can provide investment advice in accordance with the investment services law.
So far, there has been a reliance on self-regulation at worker and job level.
According to Fivan, the audit was carried out in response to individual cases where the expertise and competence of the investment adviser were insufficient.
In principle, even if skills and qualifications are low, it is also possible to act as a seller of investment products.
In principle, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other industries have significantly stricter skills requirements, "says the clay.
According to Mr Savikon, this will be tightened up from the beginning of next year with the new MiFID II Directive.
This requires each company to be responsible for ensuring that the staff providing the investment services are sufficiently skilled.
Financial supervision, on the other hand, is given the power to determine what needs to be done.
Marko Hovi, the Fivan Market Supervisory Authority, says that one of the clear changes to the current regime is the regulation on requirements for the knowledge and experience of investment advisers and investment product sellers.
According to the Court, the new requirements will apply both to the staff of the investment firms themselves and to the affiliated clients who sell the products on behalf of a company.
The Court says that, according to a proposal made by the government of the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will have the power to determine knowledge and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided in the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and further training.
All this needs to be documented and the company has a duty to show that this has also been done.
The Court specifies that in practice the company must, for example, map the individual job descriptions of the employees.
There will certainly be different standards depending on whether it is investment advice or product sales.
According to the Court, the new is also the requirement to work with someone who has experienced the deadline, if the expertise or experience is not sufficient.
In other words, if a company employs a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work for a certain period with a person who meets the criteria.
According to the Court, the change will tighten and give effect to the rules.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will be strengthened at the beginning of 2018.
Photo: 787 Dreamliner "drew" a giant aircraft over the United States
The route taken by the aircraft was carried over by the United States at the service of Flightradar24.
The flight was carried out on Thursday, 787 Dreamliner with which Boeing tested the durability of its Rolls Royce aircraft on a long flight.
The plane ran for 18 hours and 1 minute for 15 700 km, which is longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in the world.
The flight stayed within the US borders for the whole time.
It flew in total through 17 states.
Imatra's persistent coastal bathing schools will not be moment-time rain or a fast of the sun - Itines Kaikkonen polski
Iinas Kaikkonen moved forward at a good pace, following the Taina Itkonen.
Imatra's coastal bathing schools run on sludge and Lempuka this and next week.
Although sometimes it rains and then it shines again, the young bathers are not in fashion, praise the swimming school leader Taina Itkonen.
This week's bathing schools will have a total of 13 children, next week a dozen.
The number of children of the coming week was influenced by the fact that the school and the graduate started at the time, evaluated Itkonen.
In cooperation with Imatra's coastal bathing school, the Finnish Network brings together a project and the city of Imatra.
On Thursday there was a nice atmosphere at the beach.
The sun was shining, and young school children were working to stay on the surface with swimming baths, some even in the air.
Smaller siblings were also entertained in water.
In the first place, Iivas Kaikkonen, 5, thought to go deeper into the water.
Mrs Itkonen, however, encouraged her to burn down the beach.
Well done!
Iinas Kaikkonen told me that he had a lot of swimming this summer.
The beach of the sludge is good for him.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, the swimming pool continued to practice its swimming with Vili HUHTANEN, 5.
You too can be satisfied with today's achievements, the speed praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, again wanted to use water in the meantime.
Ilona Villberg, who has followed her 6 bathing from the beach, sees the beach as a good start to bathing.
Even though the weather has been what happens, Anna has every day become tired of going here.
Sometimes you had to warm up.
The children of Utopian were packed on the platform.
The boys were busy with the discovery of the frog at the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels to the pier, grab the fruit and shine the day.
The lesson was already taught in water, but the pier was not rushed.
Such as not part of the summer.
The unknown soldier sells windmills - "Here is a semmoinen linking story"
You see all kinds of things.
Sinitute, a few days ago, introduced a series of non-approved military products for cleaning products.
In other words, the counter-offers and the towels - as well as the "toilet-brush with a recorder."
An unknown soldier refers to the marketing of his next night's film and the leffa in the autumn.
Yet there is something special in the combination, and in social media the products have been mocked: When will the unrecognised health ties come?
You have to call to the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Vice-President of Sinitutte, say?
We are a film partner.
Like many other companies, we are supporting this film.
We wanted to support domestic production and cultivatable, "says Määttä.
According to him, a special presentation comes into the shops, and the film thus gets visibility.
Is there not something rather funny about this - often when you think that products and stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, here is such a unifying story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, "Määttä says.
According to him, the company endorses the same basic Finnish values as those of those who have seen an old, unknown soldier.
And cleaning is not foreign to military culture either, "Määttä points out.
Other business partners of the Unknown Soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
For example, Hartwall's vichy, which can be found under the name Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela, has been put on the market so far.
"Unknown" products were already planned to launch Kalle Kinnunen, Finland's blogger on Kuvalahti
There are already coffee and clocks available.
Mr Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the next night of the film, so there is still a way to go.
For example, Valio, the processor, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen, have not yet revealed their military products.
Results of the new test for Swedish asylum seekers are published
The latest results of the medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been published, but the results of the tests carried out under the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were over 18 years of age.
The Swedish National Judicial Medicines Agency started testing earlier this year.
The tests will be able to assess the age of the asylum seeker more accurately; a new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Migration Agency has carried out 6 880 tests so far, and the results of 2 481 tests have now been published by the Judicial Medicines Agency, which were carried out between mid-March and the end of July in 2017.
Of the 80% tested, i.e. 2002, the asylum seeker was identified as over 18 years of age and, in 25 cases, the forensic institute determined that the testing was "possibly 18 years old or older."
In 432 cases it was concluded that the asylum seeker was "possibly under 18 years of age."
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to suspect the applicant of having indicated the age.
Johan Göransson's office in the field of forensic medicine shows that the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"The figures are pretty consistent: There are no big differences in the statistics of recent months," he told The Local.
Although a large number of applicants were identified as over the age of 18, this does not necessarily mean that they have lied.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases there was "an indication that the study was 18 years old or older."
When Svenska Dagbladet studied the same results, it became clear that in 243 cases the applicant had openly declared that he would be celebrating 18 years this year.
The medical age assessment method used for the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of knees. Then dentists and radiologists analyse the images. The method has also been criticised.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrine-logist of the Karoline Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of human beings.
"I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the method used is the right one.
Determining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't determine the age for sure, we should not pretend we can, "he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, the Legal Medicines Agency, defended the accuracy of the tests: "It can be generally said that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is greatest when the age of 18 is soon to be tested, with the risk around 10%.
Ilone collapsed in Scotland with 30 seats
Five more than par in the third round led Mikko Ilose's 30 paragraphs on a sliding edge in the European golf tour of Scotland.
Ilonen left number 11 on Saturday, but at the end of the round he found 41.
Iloselle was built up in a difficult coke in one of the clubs of the three bosses.
Others were also difficult.
Ian Poultr, an Englishman, stood up to divide the top in one less than par round, even though he said there was enough work going on over the umbrella.
The cozy was raw, but the thugs involved and finally the day was good, the Poultr wind.
He will share the top position with his countryman Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
The Governor of West Virginia will change the party
On Thursday evening, Jim Justice, democratic Governor of West Virginia announced a change of party at the Trump Campaign.
"I was simply rejected by democrats," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you, after many prayers and in-depth reflection... Today I am telling the people of Western Estonia that I can no longer help you as governor of democrats."
The public broke out with a wave of applause.
"As a member of the Republican Party registered tomorrow," Justice added.
As a coach I would say to you that it is time for a new game.
Trump promised earlier that a major announcement would be made at the West Virginia Campaign.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support the Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected as Governor in 2016. Forbes is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited from his father a mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
His property is worth about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement that 'Governor Justice's change of political parties is yet another blow to a democratic party that is building obstacles rather than better America'.
Under these circumstances, the Justice Revelation is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership and is unable to find a positive, people-related message, "stated Ronna McDonne of the RNC's opinion to the CBS.
Salad sown damage - Thursday becoming a very thunderstorm of the summer
At the end of the week, other thunderstorms will also be added to southern Finland.
In the past week, it has been particularly thunderstorm in the central and northern parts of the country and in the area of Southwest Finland.
During the night between Wednesday and Thursday several fires broke out.
According to Meteorologist, Thursday may become a very thunderstorm of the previous summer.
The Ukkoskuuros have finally discovered Finland as well.
During the past week there has been a lot of lightning, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the area of Southwest Finland.
A private salama struck a line house at an electric centre, causing a small fire.
The rescue service was informed about the fire by about a quarter to midnight on Wednesday.
The electric centre was located in the sauna house on a line house away.
The fire station was breaking the ceiling and the wall in order to find the fire areas and extinguished the fire quickly.
Eleven homes were left without electricity, but personal injury was avoided.
On the other hand, in Loimaa, a lightning set was set on the display of the outside building in Harjunta before midnight.
When the rescue service came, the building was already in full fire phase, and the rescue service could only prevent the fire from spreading.
The appearance of about fifty square metres burned to the ground.
In Kuopio, the salama was once again hit by a private house.
The people of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flammable salami.
The rescue plant was there to check the case, but this time the lightning did not produce a fire - only a few melts were quick.
The traffic thunderstorm caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when the lightning attack damaged the traffic management system.
The information about the defect was provided on Thursday morning between eight and nine, after which, in the meantime, trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was not resolved until just before five in the afternoon.
Since then, rail traffic has also been able to continue normally on a thunderstorm track.
Salamat has wreaked havoc in various parts of Finland.
Lightning, however, has been relatively small this summer.
This summer's thunderstorms have been all over the place! Evaluate the Vice-President of the Meteorologist Jari Tuominen.
Wednesday and Thursday's thunderstorms have mainly been moderate in their intensity, but thanks to the small lightning over the summer, they also seem to be often powerful.
This might seem like a very hard thunder, but that is what it has been compared to this summer's thunder, "says Tuominen.
On Wednesday, the low ground areas were 1,700 times cracked, and on Thursday there has been potential even for the toughest thunderstorm of the summer: By around 16: 00, there were 1,790 strawberries in the playoffs.
If the lightning is still going on in the early part of the evening, then more than two thousand lightning, the coming prophesies.
The last record number of hide-and-seek was in 2015, when the number of spies in the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, this year's salami had increased to 18 386 salami.
So there is still room for manoeuvre to ensure that this year does not break the 'record' of two years ago.
Ukkoskir can, however, be expected to continue.
According to Tuomas, the air mass in Finland will remain warm and moist during the rest of the week, which is a favourable environment for the thunderstorm.
Ukkonen's main focus will move from the north to the south on Saturday, where approximately 2,000 salami days can be obtained on Saturday and Sunday.
There will be a more integrated rainy front in the centre of the country.
According to such Tuomas, the thunderstorm is few and far between.
Code praises Russia's "open-minded" apology for the doping scandal
The world's sports boss, Sebastian Coe, praised the apology he had openly described as Russia's due to the doping scandal on Thursday, but he added that it was not yet time to lift the Russian ban on participation.
At the IAAF Congress held on Thursday, on the eve of the World Cup, Dmitry Shljuhtin, the Russian sports leader, said that the Russian ban was appropriate and that he was determined to fight against doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were taken away from gold or silver in the competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAEA Congress voted to extend the ban, which was closed to sporting competitions in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency's WADA report provided evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very direct; it was a very generous proposal," told journalists by the chairman of the IAAF, Mr Coe.
"The whole Council and Congress welcomed the admission by the Russian Athletics Association that the country had gone through difficult times and declared that they would do their utmost to restructure their activities."
He also said that he was' satisfied 'by Russia's acceptance of the conditions for lifting the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the Group's recommendation that now is not the time to lift the Russian ban," Mr Coe said.
"We must do all we can in the coming months to normalise the situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from a corrupt system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing with neutral athletes at the World Championships in Athletics, which will start in London on Friday, and they have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
On Monday, the head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said that Russia still has many requirements to meet before it can be restored.
"The testing is still inadequate and the banned coaches are still free," he told the journalists following his presentation to the IAAF Council in London on Friday.
The production company disappointed the poor success of the Tom of Finland film
Tom of Finland won't have the success the authors wanted, "says Yle.
To be honest, I am disappointed to admit that the film was produced by Annika Sucksdorff in an interview with the Chief Executive of Helsinki.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative and it seems that it is.
The film received its first night in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached over 100,000 viewers, which is a little compared to the film budget, which is about EUR 5 million.
There was no lottery for this, but now it is important that investors get their own back.
If the film had been more successful at home, they would already have had their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams of foreign releases, "Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukske.
How the economic rules of football affect the Neyman transfer to Paris
The regulations restricting the use of European football clubs do not preclude the transfer of Neyman from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain in France, which is the most expensive player transfer ever in football.
The possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
UEFA introduced fair play economic rules in 2011, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that the Neyman transfer has been financed without major losses.
EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona for the termination of the Brazilian agreement, and Neyman's annual salary in the new club moves in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neyman to France involves various economic aspects.
The PSG has no difficulty in paying the sum of Neyman's transfers and is adding him to its star cover, as it is going to finance the ruling family that has enriched Qatar's oil.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums on players' purchases, but they must be balanced by real sources of income so that the football business is not a loss-making business.
Fair game economic rules were created at the initiative of Michel Platini, a French President-elect of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini took the view that the pursuit of success in debt was a sham and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play's financial rules shifted from clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model first used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 became significantly more difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player purchases and created a global brand.
The current three-year assessment period for fair play economic rules runs until 2018, during which clubs may make losses of up to EUR 30 million.
Although Platini was forced to leave UEFA's presidency in a scandalous manner in 2015, his successor, Alexander Cefer, also wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
"Fair play rules are still in place and we will continue to apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for fair play rules in UEFA, reported to the Association Press News Agency last week.
Although PSG paid Neyman out of its contract for a one-off payment, it can quantify the amount in its accounting for the entire duration of his new contract.
Because Neyman has concluded a five-year contract, the transfer amount can be recorded at EUR 44.4 million per year over the next five years.
In 2014, the first sanctions were handed out on the basis of fair-game economic rules. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Abu Dhabi-funded Manchester City.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the period 2014-2015, instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is monitoring clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing its income through companies linked to the owners of the club.
For example, if a company in qatalar supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal market level, UEFA will not count the support as a result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that support for PSG from the Qatar Tourism Authority was excessive.
It has also emerged that some of Mr Neyman's merits in the PSG could be financed by contributions from the CFO in 2022.
The PSG and the organising committee have, however, refused to allow Neyman to be an ambassador for the World Cup. UEFA would find it very easy to reveal such an arrangement.
As a result of the PSG's previous sanctions, UEFA is monitoring companies even more closely than usual to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, well-informed sources reported that UEFA had not negotiated the transfer of Neyman.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on condition that their identity is not disclosed, as they do not have the power to discuss the PSG situation.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG's net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was more than EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neyman to attract new sponsors and increase sales of club products and shirts.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 percent with the Neyman agreement.
The Spanish League, clearly irritated at the departure of one of the best players in the world, tried to make it difficult for Neyman to move, allegedly in breach of the rules of fair play.
'This is a clear economic doping case, both for society and for the state, 'Javier Teba, President of the Spanish League, said to the Spanish AS newspaper.
Arsenal's manager, Arsene Wenger, also has reservations about the state funding the activities of a football club.
"This is a result of ownership that has completely changed the environment of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
Fair game economic rules are going to be very difficult to enforce. There are so many interests involved in the fact that a famous player represents the state. "
Now it is urgent: The coach of the Finnish World Cup in Helsinki
The long-term jumper arttu Pajulahti and the triple-winner Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, although she should prepare for the World Championships in Athletics in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Tomorrow, willow will be in competition for the long-range defined game, and Mäkelä on Saturday in the three-way street.
However, a twin coach, Ghazaryan of Armenia, has not received a visa in Great Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this matter on a British show without success.
The coach has the invitation of the World Cup organisers as a documentary, but even that person has not been able to get a visa.
I wonder whether this is one of the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, the coaching director Jorma Kempppressure said.
He has always successfully dealt with visas himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He is doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sport Association for Sul for years.
It doesn't have such a big meaning.
As soon as someone looks at the steps in the stadium for themselves, Arttu Pajulahti said that his coach had a possible opt-out.
Finland's World Film Festival demands a miracle
The World Championships in Athletics will open in London today on Friday and will last for more than a week to finish on Sunday 13 August.
Athletics, cross country skiing and ice hockey are the species to which Finnish puppet athletes can be passionate about year after year, fire success or not.
Success in medals is measured in the hearts of puppy athletes.
Of course, there are other indicators.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one value to another, where experience matures to the performance of the sportsman to the level that the World Cup of Adults is genuinely possible.
Now there are no young athletes of this kind in Finland's small World Cup team, and even though there are no clubs.
The mm medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the attractiveness and surprise of sport is that miracles can happen.
It draws the puppy athletes to the front of the television screen and the glue follows the Games, even though the London medals are only solved late in the evening due to the time difference.
Finland received one bronze medal from the previous World Championships 2015 in Athletics.
It was brought by the spear-shooter Tero Pitkämäki.
Many believers are expecting a medal from Pitkämäki even now, although the results of recent times by him and other throwers and the fact that there is still a long-range loss in the value of last summer.
Come what may, Pitkäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
It is a good enough performance for other Finnish athletes to enter the final race or to make their own record.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal leader of Finnish Athletics in the coming years will be a great success for the international dignity of young people this summer.
The breeding of young talent and financial support for its work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come overnight, but requires years of sweat work from athletes and patience from both training and puppy athletes.
Finns can also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performance.
I hope that the London Games will go down in history in the games of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of terrorist intimidation or cowardly attacks, for example.
Enni Rukajärvi 2 in Copper's big air - "But annoyed"
The snow scientist Enni Rukajärvi is located in the second big air race in Colorado, USA.
Copper Mountain has become the second largest player on the Rukajärvi at the Great Air Cup.
The women's contest was won by the U.S. Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the competition.
He tried the last jump in the box 1080 for the first time in the Games and it was very close to succeeding.
Good feeling and a good feeling is now, but it's a pity that the last jump didn't go all right.
I do intend to do so again from now on in the Games, the core of Rukajärvi.
A jump made for the species in the big fence of the snow tree.
Viking Line's new long-ship to the harbour in Helsinki
The new long-ship vessel in Viking is long overdue.
The ship had to leave Helsinki to Tallinn at 18: 00.
There were eight countries on the ship.
The ship came to Helsinki already late.
For at least an hour and a half I have waited to get to the ship.
Now the queue is moving slightly, at 7.30 p.m., the Estonian citizen who is waiting to get to the ship at Helsinki port, Johannes Rebane.
Mr Rebane thought there had been a technical fault in the new ship.
Rebane told that the shipping company had brought access to the water bottles waiting in their cars.
Christa GRÖNLUND, the communications manager in Viking, says to IS that there was a technical fault in the law.
It was repaired in Helsinki port.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
GRÖNLUND says that the ship will also miss the return trip to Tallinn for a couple of hours.
The ship had to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 20.15.
42-metre specialised transfer interferes with the traffic in Kuutostis on Thursday night
A special shuttle of 42 metres moves from Muuku to the port of Mustola on Thursday evening.
Nine should arrive by the afternoon of 11.
The police are directing traffic by car, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
Transport from one hill to another goes by road to 13 in the port of Mustola.
The little circle of nostalgia: We Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, the story reeks up both in the 80s of the glorious days of characters and in the 90s of the grudge (at that time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a brilliant "State" series for MTV) and their own time - 2001, before Elizabeth Bandh, Paul Bandh and Paul Bandh moved into the other stars.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant remembrance we have stuck in in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it already seems outdated.
First Day of Camp was surprisingly good, and not only because of its absurd humour (it included the story of the vegetable can now speak with H. Jon Benjamin's voice).
The essence of Vits is that middle-aged actors act covertly each other approaching maturity. Highlighting this makes it impossible to reach the past part of the joke.
Ten Years late, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more patchy: For example, it is parroting the 90-century Stalinist Foundation, such as the horror film by a hand that dares to boil.
At one point, one of the characters is digging up Apple Powerbook, inline rollers and 'other stuff from 1991'.
Many stories are the same as in the past.
Farewell Coop (Michael Show alter) is now a writer but has still not passed over Katieie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And there is a crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Michael Show) as a criminal partner George H. W. Bush (who is very good at Michael Ian Black).
As always in such columns, the best are the sidepaths.
It is particularly fun to see the ancient young Paul Rudd, who has a scoundrel under the undertone, namely Matt Dillon's "soul patch" of the film Singles.
The moments of arbitrary madness may lead this series to flight as a kind of recurrences of the Seven Up! Until it takes its obvious decision: We Hot American Summer - twenty Year late. It goes to the last meeting of Wet-Hommers.
The Amazonian Comrade Detective series, on the other hand, calls for a nostalgia: The American series, the spirit of the Cold War, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the Glow series, where the East meets the West.
The comedy was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas, a Romanian police drama of the 1980s, where a Bucharest-based user is fighting for truth, atheism and Marxist Leninism.
The main hardline Gregory of Gregory Gregory Gregory and idealistic Iosifina is seen in Flor Piersic and Corneliu Ulici. Their turn has been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (chief producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But it's not much more than that.
The series contains some good visual jokes (cops spend time watching chess on television in the same way as Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous sound actors, including Jenny Slath, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Seigny. Their bongasification gets a fun game.
The Comrade Detective is, however, too much attached to imitating the clumsy socialist drama involving, for example, a killer hiding behind a Reagan mask, and that is why the series often starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor in the series is neither fast nor abundant.
In a nutshell, the series could function better as an agitprop satire, for example, when Gregory and Iosef keep visiting the US Embassy and there are always two fat men in the fireplace of hamburgers.
The message to an imaginary communist public is that Western culture can turn everything into consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginary Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: We are numbing our own recent history and their history too.
On Saturday, Mr Toni Tauru from Kouvola will go up in Macao - the former UFC-extract
I want to keep the match going.
In Macao, the Tauru will be confronted with hard bone, because Leandro Issa, a Brazilian, was still active in the UFC organisation last year.
The Brazilian side also has the yutsu black belt and the World Cup of the species.
For once, I take action against my parents.
It's a fun thing, "says a 32-year-old Taurus.
The Kouvolan had to stand up in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled because of logistical problems, but three battles were fought over a long time to the Chinese autonomous region of Macao.
He has never faced such a thing before.
This was the first time that my match was cancelled.
It was annoyed because it took a lot of time to prepare and train.
He is pleased, however, that a new time has come for the struggle.
The week waiting has little effect on preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition, because it does not improve in a week.
The condition can get even worse if you practice too much now.
Tauru has in a few previous struggles met with opponents, whose strengths are in a grip.
This time the situation is different.
Issa kouvolainen describes a typical Brazilian character.
He is quite aggressive in the control.
I guess he will come to the first batch hard on and try to take the mat.
He has won the Jujutsu World Cup, so he knows how to wrestling.
The previous match in Kouvola did not go according to plan.
Kevin Belingon from the Philippines turned a blind eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I've never got so well hold of him: He didn't get any hits.
When I went down, he hit my eye.
That was a great pity.
New motivation
Some of them are in control once a year, others are getting bigger.
For example, the future opponent Issa has held the previous time in September.
He had three matches last year.
We are now facing another struggle this year.
Sometimes the pace has become heavy.
I have worked in recent years and been in good condition all the time.
I have, however, only been idle.
When the 32-year-old heard about the coming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoo and got the pleasure of doing it back.
We got really good workouts with one of the friends from Sweden.
Training was a great help, because on Saturday a handful of people will be prepared for a physical struggle.
I have been trained against opponents of the same size and practice a vertical match.
Vertical grasp is the main activity of a 32-year-old.
We have to be smart.
If there is an opportunity, I will of course take the plot myself.
Alasvenders must not be given free of charge, as they consume the most.
Macao has been tempted in the past by the use of Taurus in China.
It is reportedly China's Las Vegas.
I think we have a big evening.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%.
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will maintain interest rates while economic growth has been weak and the relaxation of inflation has put an end to speculation about interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow; it has moved interest rates because families' incomes are under increasing pressure.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's monetary policy committee decided, by 6 to 2 votes, to keep interest rates at 0.25%, a rise in interest rates which, this month, received less support due to weak economic growth.
In its quarterly inflation outlook, the bank lowered its growth forecast to 1.7% in 2017 and to 1.6% in 2018, and warned that household incomes would be under increasing pressure in the autumn, as inflation is expected to rise to close to 3%.
However, according to the bank, interest rate increases will be needed in the next few years to curb the inflation stimulated by Brexit, and the bank announced that the cost of borrowing could be increased further than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package that started to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme programme in February 2018, although it is now expected that it will provide cheap finance for banks in excess of £15 million, or a total of 115 million.
The protocol to the decision on interest rates of the Bank states that: 'The monetary commission forecasts that GDP will continue to develop slowly over the next few years as the fall in real household incomes reduces consumption'.
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for 'a certain degree of tightening of monetary policy' to meet market expectations' to contain inflation.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "gradual" and "limited."
In May, the bank forecast an increase of 1.9% this year and of 1.7% next year.
It now kept its growth forecast for 2018 to 1.8%.
The pound sterling has weakened in relation to the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound sterling weakened by 0.5 per cent and stood at $1.31; compared to the euro, it weakened by 0.4 per cent and was EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was taken after lower than expected growth slowed down by the rise in interest rates. GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter and by 0.2% in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its most recent inflation survey gave little hope to households suffering from rising inflation and low wage increases, and the bank says that the situation will get worse before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the drop in income in the next few years. However, it expects wage developments to be "substantially" recovered at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound sterling, which will neutralise part of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after interest rates were reduced to 0.25% after the shock of the referendum on the EU, which plunged the pound into decline.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be felt in prices and in the economy only after four years.
In the run-up to the most recent decision by the Central Bank, there had been an increasing call for interest rate increases, as inflation increased the pressure on households.
Inflation peaked last month at 2.6% in June from 2.9%, but the bank says it was expected and inflation will rise again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the excess over its 2% target was "entirely" due to the weak pound.
"Given the recent drop in swap interest rates, competition in the mortgage market would appear to be increasing further as creditors are feverishly seeking customers and want to close the year strongly," says Coreco Mortgage Brokers Director Andrew Montlake.
"The markets look particularly good to those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. Renewal contracts are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also no cost-effective alternatives."
NHS accounts for 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
From September onwards, patients will be able to be prescribed a "revolutionary" anti-HIV drug. The Supreme Court brought to an end the dispute over the funding of this medicine in the English public health system (NHS).
The NHS indicated that pre-exposure inhibition (pre-exposure) is prescribed for around 10,000 people during the first three-year experiment. Prior to the treatment, it has been found to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% in individuals with high risk.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld last year's ruling by the Supreme Court, which states that NHS is able to pay for the prep medicine, even though it is claimed that it should be funded by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, the leader of the NHS, called the decision announced on Thursday 'a major new intervention', and was described by the National AIDS Association as' a crucial moment '.
The medical health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to welcome applications for an experiment that will be extended in October to other clinics. The experiment will reach its full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure inhibition (prev) is the pre-sexual transmission drug that reduces the risk of infection.
Tests have shown that the prep significantly reduces HIV infections in high-risk groups.
Before sexual intercourse to be a medicine means that the body has intercourse enough medication to prevent HIV infection.
The medicine can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment targets gay men, bisexual men and transgender people as well as people with HIV positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
The clinics will select applicants who meet the conditions for testing from men, women and transgender people as well as those who are not known to have anti-retroviral treatment of their HIV positive partner.
People who live in England and have registered to be treated as general practitioners can also apply for an experiment in their local sexual health clinic.
It costs GBP 10 million and this week, following an international call for tenders, the NHS signed a contract for medicines.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of the pre-p medicine by gathering extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and implementing the treatment.
"This important new intervention should complement and enhance the already existing comprehensive and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV," says Stevens.
"This is yet another significant achievement in the struggle over 30 years to tackle one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," said Deborah Gold, Director of the National AIDS Association.
"If pre-medication is correctly targeted at those in need and at risk, it can have a decisive impact on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, people at risk will, through an experiment funded by the NHS, be able to decide independently on the use of this medicine without the need to negotiate with a partner, which will have a powerful effect, which will improve the lives of very many people.
This was welcome news. "
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that none of the risk groups is excluded," says Ian Green, Director of Terrence Higgins.
"The pre-p medicine used in the experiment has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the prep experiment is a welcome event which continued unnecessarily for several months because of the government's slowness," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health in the shadow government.
"We have evidence that this medicine can have a decisive impact on our work to prevent the spread of HIV and this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of a pre-p medicine.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get a step closer once again to the situation in which society has been able to stop the spread of HIV. "
Quality of life
Joanne Leigh, a former banker keen on renovation, moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in the Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is the queen of the first floor of the traditional house of the Anna era. The success of the renovation is demonstrated by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed his bags and changed.
"Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridges in a much larger apartment," says Joanne.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I was on the housing screen and noticed that the rooms were as high as they were in my home at the time.
I liked right away and made an offer on the same day. "
Since then, about 90 square apartments have undergone a complete transformation.
It was a double room, where only the kitchen was able to reach the bedroom. Joanne wanted more storage space and a middle floor so that the height of the room could be utilised.
"I wanted space, large windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands, "he says.
He recruited from the Duck & Shed Planning Bureau of Erfan Azadig Notting Hills. Erfan was given the task of making use of almost four metres of the upper room and creating an apartment which would not only be a renovation and sale but a home.
The height of the room was not quite enough to double space, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where the capacity was standing.
Erfan needed creative thinking.
"Steel structures are quite complex.
The premises had to be organized twice over so that they did not have to cross.
The structures had to be designed in such a way that the height was just fit both on and below. "
Erfan was able to place the two whole high rooms together with fascinating details.
In the middle floor, the copper-fastened window of Retrouvius opens to a stylish stay.
The mirror golden furniture, silver components and Serge Mouil's vintage luminaires create a characterising style.
The use of mirrors brings theatrical feeling, space and light.
The mirrors on both ends of the short corridor make the corridor appear to be beyond the actual point.
The mirror in the kitchen is like a window, opening a view to another room.
There is a storage space for the meals and glass items of Joanne on the entrance.
In addition to the style, the kitchen can be hidden when it is not used.
The kitchens on the ground are not a new solution,
But in Joanne's kitchen it is unique that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of planning," Erfan says about the steel-proof cooling-off at the MDF door.
"It is balanced, i.e. it dissolves when it comes to lifting very easily in place."
With rational use of space and the planning of a storage space, Joan obtained 16 extra square space, a second bedroom and a better basic solution.
"When selling an apartment, the area determines - or the value of the property," says Erfan.
"In the basic case, the real estate agent walks in the apartment and calculates the price on the basis of the surface area."
In the Joanne apartment, the area was increased by the use of high-quality materials that bring the space a luxury.
"The resident is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotional housing is partly based on them," says Erfan.
"No one is attached to power lines running in walls.
They are also important, but not in the same way. "
Joanne's apartment is an example of the fact that good design and enhancements can make the basic condition exceptionally fine.
It may also happen that you don't want to move away from the apartment.
The pregnant princess Sofia radiated to the summer story
The button was hit by a resident of Princess Sofia.
In Båstad, Sweden was represented by Princess Sofia for the last time before her birth.
A sustainable Tomorrow was chosen by the princess of Hennon for dinner.
Sofia was represented smiling.
The Swedish Princess Sofia has visited Båstad in Sweden this week.
On Wednesday day Sofia was represented at a Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a magnificent blue-body outfit which brilliantly dressed the last pregnant princess.
Sofia came in with a dark strawberry crowd.
This is the last representation event in which Sofia will be represented before her birth.
His calculated time is in September.
For dinner at the event Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel dress, which landed wonderfully.
The style was crowned with large ear jewels and a elegant bag.
The pastel blue dress up the princess well.
Sofia has been on a delegation trip to Båstad in Sweden this week.
Sofia used to live in a small bag.
Sofia was actually radiating in a raging summer story.
Sofia even became passionate about chatting to photographers.
Now I'm just holding on, Sofia said laughing, referring to her final pregnancy.
He will grow us with a sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, a dashboard appeared in Lahti Square where Thai food was sold.
The Latvians did not dare to taste, but walked past.
In Kojus food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Pentti, among the familiar banks.
He did not know much about Finnish, and the Finns did not know that at that time.
Because the people did not dare to go to eat, the Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the cantons to eat Thai food, spring at a time.
Countries, "he said.
I was hooked.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, the Bank opened its Thai shop in Lahti.
There were two small tables, and I think there would be less than 20 customer seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to the ventovir.
When hunger and places are limited, you cannot leave a chair between yourself and a guest.
Little by little we got to know better and we became friends.
In the end I sat at the table with a dictionary to learn that from Thai.
Two years went to the hall, but then the restaurant had to be changed because the spices that were made themselves were said to smell too much in the hall.
A new place was freed from the end of the shop model.
There is space.
Now we, the jury, can sit back at our tables, only at peak times, we are shy of asking the guests whether there is room next to us.
The Panja knows its customers.
He is told where he belongs, where he is visited, and whom he has seen.
He knows what food each eats.
He has seen how the customer's life stages vary and the food club changes.
He remembers with which man I went to eat my first spring serf.
He remembers me as a lean and fat, and remembers what I was like when I was young.
It is nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, to sit down next to the door of the kitchen and to change the way you belong to the counter with a bank based on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalisation with a sweet chilikke.
He has opened up not only our senses, but also our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many people speak to him that - thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panjaa.
Even though he too has been difficult, he is always kind.
He's hard-working.
On top of the food work, she goes to the mushroom and blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant celebrated two decades in secret.
We customers got a strawberry cake for the second meal.
Without a commotion or attention went to this remarkable day, in front of the work.
The discovery of underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to strike in Europe
At the beginning of the year, the security authorities received an important list for the fight against terrorism.
The list contains more than 170 data from the Isis militants who are ready to attack Europe.
According to Die Welt in Germany, there are a total of 173 persons and the document contains not only their personal data but also images of each.
Over 130 of the persons listed are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also involved.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Evening-Sanomat told about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the list's location and the information contained in it have been clarified.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi army's special forces found a list of terrorists' personal data and images when they investigated the terrorist organisation's underground base in Mosul.
The US intelligence services assessed the authenticity of the paper and forwarded it to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to the security authorities of all European countries in May.
The underlying fear was that something big and serious would be planned by western terrorists after the fall of Isis in the Middle East.
According to die Welt, the list includes not only the names and images of all persons but also their date of birth, invented alias well as information about the person's country of origin.
The list also specifies the particular areas of terrorism.
For example, in the case of Sami J, a 27-year-old German on the list, Abu Assad al-Alman, a German, is the battle name.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012, first travelling to Egypt, then to Libya and later via Turkey to join the Isis ranks.
Next to his image, a suicide bomber has been written as a special field.
There is no more detailed knowledge of the fate of a man.
A total of about 6 000 fighters have left the Isis ranks and their fate is uncertain.
The Man sank under the surface of Helsinki
According to interviews with the rescue service, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a parent can save the life of drowning.
On Thursday, a person who had been under water was saved at the Tokuk Bank of Helsinki.
According to Ville Estlander, the on-call fire manager of the Helsinki rescue service, the situation was quickly over.
The person was found under the water for about 15 minutes after the notification.
She was discovered by the rescue diving agent under the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue department received the notification half past four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to first care.
Estlander says that it was a 50-year-old man.
According to the interviews the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation on the beach is already over.
Estlander commends the cooperation of the authorities with the Border Guard and the police.
This was a task led by the Border Guard.
They also provided excellent guidance to the divers.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was saved from water, together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars collided in Eura - nine in cars, three seriously injured
There were a total of nine people in cars, the rest of whom were less seriously injured, says the on-call fireman.
Both men and women are among the injured.
The accident took place at the crossroads of three roads at four times a day.
The Kolari happened when another car turned from the warning triangle in front of another car, says the on-call firemaster.
According to the rescue facility there is a speed limit of 80 km / h in the crossing area.
Brothers fighting for more than $500 million property
Two brothers are arguing over one of the largest property empires in Victoria, which is worth over USD 500 million, and this is linked to their Italian family 40 years ago to set up a family business.
The former President of Carlton's football club and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the value area of Torak, only three houses away from his younger brother Paul.
Paul has wanted to leave a family business as early as 2014, but there is bitter controversy about the resignation.
The brothers and their mother Anna jointly owned 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family started to build up property when they bought a trade on the Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family set up Westco Jeans trade there, which expanded into a chain of 160 movements.
The trading chain was sold at USD 85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, property development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento and housing in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres for suburban areas.
According to an agreement with the deceased father of the family, Colin owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul describes his father as "the driving force and the main character of the family."
According to legal documents, the asset distribution ratio means that Colin owns some 316 million dollars and Paul about 176 million dollars.
Paul is not satisfied with the allocation of property and money.
"I think that Colin left the best real estate to himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first oath of right in 2015.
Last Friday the case was first discussed by the Supreme Court after several mediation attempts.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
He is accusing Pauli of mismanagement in some of the buildings.
Colin writes in one of his first legally binding certificates that he would like to find a solution.
"In line with our Italian traditions, my family is the most important one," says Colin in his statement.
There are hundreds of pages of options, e-mails and reports.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded dairy bars and souvenirs in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a trade from Brunswick.
They were used as an insurance policy when they bought a real estate in Collingwood, where Colin set up the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says that he set up a trade "in the last years of high school while Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi who died in 2012 wanted to transfer the properties to their sons in harmony.
"Luigi often said that he does not want the brothers to go to court," Anna writes in her statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Luts business. According to Colin, Mark got $10 million and Luke 26 million on leaving the company.
According to Pauli, Luke and Mark are "bitter about the economic conditions of their origin."
Colin has kept a low profile, even though he is a former member of the Australian Football League government and the best friend of Eddie McGuire, the television star, according to this biography that appeared in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied. He said in his text message that he could not comment on the matter, because it will be dealt with in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take me to court and to take our family to court," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to agree to his brother's claims.
"Our father would not have liked us to argue this way," says Colin.
On Friday, hope seemed to have gone.
"Our cause will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
The new Chief of Staff of Trump intends to restrict the President's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to Poltico, the new head of personnel in the White House intends to limit the use of media and news by President Trump, so that the boss does not get into difficulties so often.
The journalist Josh Dawley reported:
"When the new head of staff at the White House, John F. Kelly, met with the management on his first day in office, he raised the central problem that he was going to solve: He is going to restrict the access of President Donald Trump.
Kelly told the White House's employees that all information - whether printed or in information sessions - must be passed through him, because the President takes better decisions when he receives good information. "
Mr Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to restrict the use of Trump's media and have failed.
For decades, President Trump has a relationship with television - and, as President, he is still watching much television.
"If Mr Trump was nervous about unfair reporting, it was worth showing him that the sympathetic media dealt with matters more fairly," said Sam Nunberg, an advisor in the Trump campaign, to the Political Journal in February.
Politico's journalist, Tara palm sea, wrote at the time that "it is essential to control the use of Trump Twitter that his personal media flow is a steady stream of praise."
Fine.
But it is ridiculous to claim that the use of Twitter by Trump would never have been under control.
Perhaps these campaigning workers know something that the rest of us do not know - perhaps Trump twiits would have been even more violent without their efforts.
We will probably never know what messages were not sent from Trump.
If his staff have even been able to prevent him from causing problems, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing panic.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House trying to push their case by providing Trump with information that supports their view. That information can be reliable - or not.
In May, politicians wrote that the advisors deliberately give the President questionable information.
The journalist, Shane Goldmacher, reported on a case:
"The current and former employees of Trump say that they can get a tremendous rage at the press games they criticise them - especially when they report harmful leaks of information, so they are absolutely obliged to know where the information comes from.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone gave the President a copy of the news on the GotNews.com site set up by Charles C. Johnson, deputy chief of staff, Katie Walie Walshi, on several forms of information in the White House.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment and had previously spread false accusations and subsequently withdrew them, nor did he provide any concrete evidence.
In spite of this, Trump had started the case after reading the staff concerned about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then Head of Staff, Reince Priebus, and the White House Staff, Rob Porter, had tried to introduce a system for managing documents that were going to Trump.
And what was the result?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he proves to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump continues to be his own impulse for himself and his assistants continue to pursue their own affairs.
These fixed facts make Mr Kelly's mission extremely difficult.
Neyman concluded a five-year contract with PSG
Neyman, a Brazilian star, has signed a five-year contract with PSG, according to the news agency AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neyman representatives had paid a buy-out price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, a football player in the Spanish league.
The Neyman agreement with Barcelona was therefore cancelled and he was free to move to the Parisian Society of PSG.
The huge transfer of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was in Manchester United, which paid out EUR 105 million last summer from France, Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by the state-owned company Qatar Sports Investment.
The church is chaired by Nasser al-Khelaifi, a former tennis man.
Neyman is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
The successful writer, Raija Oranen, backed the hypnosis of alcoholism and fear of flying: "I am in good shape."
On TV series, the Rubelieve time and the Clean Clothes were celebrated as the successful writer, Raija Oranen.
The hypnosis helped Raija Orasta.
Five grandchildren like the mud in such a grip that Raija and her husband, Jyrki, gave up the Spanish sun and the Fuengirola apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their houses, but now in the spring also the rental apartment went out.
Out of the old circles of light and sun, Raijan once brought depression and alcoholism out of which he had survived.
The external character is also 20 kilos lighter.
The weight went to fall when serotonin drugs were stopped, they were anti-agents.
At one time I was helped by hypnosis, which also helped me to fear the air, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes people, the swry writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have travelled the same way for over 45 years.
I can do better than ever.
For more than 40 years, Jyrki Oranen, who worked in the field of rail and tourism, has been working together.
I Kosin, and it was married to go on for two weeks, Raija laughs.
That's the queen of drama he's always been, he's finished his life of that, "Jyrki laughs to his wife.
Oranen, who made a great literary career, remembers only a good 44-part of the Pure White-bed TV series that touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally decided to become the business of a fresh family company in the clothing industry when I read the 50-year interview in Liisa Seppänen's plane.
I was the daughter of a sewing agent myself; my mother also had a clothing business and sometimes I was continental, "Orane remembers.
For him, the plot and story changed the attitude of the Finns to entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's study and thesis revealed it, "says Oranen.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer of active time, he has many manuscripts under work - ideas for hundreds.
The Travellers returned to the place of the "millionaires"
The wealthiest owners of the West Midlands are once again at loggerheads with stubborn travellers who managed to cross the much-needed stream of the municipality and return to the fields next to the houses.
The nomadic people park around the street of the millionaires, called the 'nomadic caravan', in Solitaill.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross a municipality's thirst for a pavement, bringing with them children, horses and a van army.
The nomads managed to cross the barrier at a point where they had been left unprotected because of the path.
The municipality of Solihul has been accused by the outraged population of being 'totally incapable of solving the problem'.
An anonymous resident tells us that the travellers have come from Bentley Heath on Monday evening, where they had thrown passers-by stones.
"The municipality must be made to work because it seems completely incapable of solving the problem.
The nomadic people were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them in the evening and probably more today. "
A resident said that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by refusing access to the parks.
"I live in Streetbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay a local taxes when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the nomads returned so soon after they were driven out.
"There are more of them, and they've even put a horse in a pasture park."
According to Solihul's municipal spokesman, the municipality is aware of the illegal camping taking place near Streetbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal steps with Solihul's police to remove the campsites as soon as possible.
In order to collect evidence, it is very important that as many local police officers as possible report disturbing or criminal activities.
It will help to provide an overall view of the situation in court proceedings. "
Portugal's disaster was surrounded by furious people
In Portugal, men who have made a forced landing on a beach full of people have been tried today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the forced fall.
The two men who have flown the plane may be prosecuted for their death fault.
Portugal is the country with the longest period of imprisonment for 16 years.
A small aircraft flying by men had to make a compulsory landing yesterday on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon, because of a technical fault.
During the event there were hundreds of people on the beach, some of whom ran the landing machine to escape to the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The machine hit the man first, who had the back of the plane.
Immediately after the plane got up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, "said Filipe Jania Jornal de Noticias, who had been on the beach.
The little girl killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not injured.
The beach was surrounded by small aircraft immediately after the accident with anger.
The father and other people of the girl went to the plane and started to catch the plane, told the story in Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot a criminal; he was desperate.
It is a miracle that more people did not die.
The two men on board were not injured in the forced landing.
A Finnish star that tragically lost his leg won the World Cup again: "Without an accident I would not be a world champion."
Matti Great-Hamari celebrated the World Cup of gold on Wednesday morning in the banked slalom in Canada's Big White.
In the past, Greater Hamari also won the Cross World gold at the Games.
In total, there are already three MM tits.
Quite incredible World Cup!
Twice the gold was treated, the Great Hamar, who was reached by telephone, was very happy.
The 30-year-old calculator thanked his coach and the very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Great Hamar, the number of challenges in the species is increasing all the time.
The whole area of paraluding has grown and developed very much in recent times.
The differences are getting smaller and there are lots of new calculators involved.
You always wonder whether there is a black horse behind you.
There seems to be a different winner in each race.
Great Hamar lost his second leg in the motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had fallen enthusiastically from a young age to his friends, and the accident did not take the desire to get into the chest.
I wonder what my life would be like in the absence of such an accident.
But my attitude has always been that there is no point in jogging.
With these cards played what has been distributed, Greater Hamar stresses.
It would be a cruel titauler, a serious accident and a loss of limb as a stroke of luck, and neither does Greater Hamar make it.
But he turned to his advantage the terrible difficulty.
Yes, I would say that the situation prevailed.
I would not be a three-fold world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the biggest ferry race in 23-year-old Greater Hamar was already fading.
It was only after the accident that a real start was made towards the Duuni top.
When I was young, I was trying with my friends, and we were always excited about X-Games.
But they were far-off wounds that dimmed somewhat over time.
After the accident I found myself in some way from the start of X-Games.
I could not have imagined beforehand.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a really long life if I remain here to be interrupted and mourned.
I chose to pull the ghosts on the neck and start working.
I would say that I have been quite successful.
The calculator was delighted with the choice of Leo-Pekka Star as the great athlete of the year.
A four-fold Olympic winner was awarded his prize at a sports rally in January.
According to Greater Hamar, this victory is an important signal to the sports people.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely deserved.
This will certainly also open our eyes to the parasports world.
When is it time to launch a double World Cup year's athletes campaign, Matti Greater Hamar?
We shall see.
I will try to do my best to succeed.
Even the Great Hamar has not conquered all the top of his lusts.
That is the big objective for next year.
In a year's time, the Paralympics will be taking place in South Korea.
Yes, from there you go for medals!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaving the country.
The "A Voice for Young Syria Refegesis" study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
The Syrian refugees are basking in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian young people do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Isis the most important thing that should happen to allow them to return to their homeland.
The Trump regime is not seen as bringing about a change in the conflict in Syria.
Burson-Marsteller, the communications agency chain, reported on the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of young Arabs for nine years.
This year's A Voice for Young Syria Refegesis study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
The survey was carried out between February and March 2017 by a total of 400 Syrian young people aged between 18 and 24, half of whom are women and half are men.
Half of the interviews were in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their country of origin permanently in the future.
42% think they will return to their home countries and 4% could not say.
According to the study, the greatest impact on the decision of young people to return home is the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of Isis in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most influential factor in the permanent return to home, while a quarter consider that the most important thing would be the departure of Isis.
Only less than a tenth of the population is making the improvement in the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria a major factor in the decision.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict
Young people in Syria were asked what the main factor was in ending the conflict.
The majority believe that an end to the war is more essential than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
More than a quarter consider the President of Assad to be an obstacle to a peace agreement.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing Syrian conflict.
Just over a quarter believe in resolving the conflict through military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugee young people see the power of Isis weakened in the last year, while the fifth feels that its power is strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against Isfathers and terrorism in general is that the media should inform people that they have nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many gave priority to military measures and educational reform.
More than a tenth of them believe that the most important thing would be to create more well-paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change under the Trump regime.
Almost one in four believes that the conflict in Syria will worsen during the year in Trump.
Opinions are divided as to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time on coding in order to keep the web in order - he has developed a database using, for example, Wikipedia and Google
MariaDB, a first-based company, is developing the "fastest growing" open source database.
The main product of MariaDB, set up by COARM Michael "Monty" Widenis, costs users nothing and can be developed online by any eminent programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of databases, vast quantities of information will remain in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedn, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the database of MariaDB or MySQL.
"All information that is not in image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked to it," explains Widenius.
Widenius, the technology director of MariaDB, spends around half of its time on coding.
A man working at a distance from Kauniainen will, for his part, ensure that the Internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open-source database MySQL together with David Axmark of Sweden.
In 2008, Sun, a technology company bought MySQL with a billion dollars, and one year later, the software giant Oracle ahilai Sun with 7.4 billion.
When the transaction took place, a large number of developers in MySQL announced they would leave.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who didn't give a definite promise of the future of MySQL," Widenius remembers.
He had already at this stage set up a company that began to develop MariaDB.
He did not want his life to die.
I paid for 20 of the best developers from the Sun and thus ensured that the continuity of the code is guaranteed by the same guys who created it.
As MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
The name just had to be changed.
A foundation was set up to monitor the freedom of development of the MariaDB code.
"During MySQL these assurances were not made," Widenius regrets.
Although many people have heard about the billion shops at Widenis and MySQL, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"Recent years have seen our growth rate around 50% per year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, Economic Director of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which is focusing on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalé is a meagre figure for the company.
He is revealing that, during the current financial year, MariaDB expects to receive orders of EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free of charge, the company has developed services around it that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps exchange databases, which can be more than a year's work if the customer has used a closed database.
The change from MySQL to MariaDB can be done in no time because they are versions of each other.
Among others, the Spanish operator Telefónica and DBS, the largest bank in South-East Asia, are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in the Linux operating systems distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Although we're a small company, we have links to the biggest players.
"Among our customers is one of the world's largest telecoms operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks," Paqvalé list.
The information markets are still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP in their closed databases.
For Oracle MySQL is a modest branch business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although research company Gartner has lost its market share in recent years, players such as MariaDB in terms of turnover are still invalid, though they are rapidly growing sines.
About USD 50 billion in the database market, open source databases do not reach even a billion.
However, the weight of open source can not be measured only in terms of money, because most users pay nothing for these software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications on top of open databases.
Moreover, more than half of the old databases would then have been exchanged for open or at least initiated.
Big companies don't get new customers because most of them will next choose open source.
This has led to a proliferation of fees for licences for commercial databases.
Companies want to do as much money as they did in the past with a smaller number of customers. "
As it is difficult to change a closed database, most of the client companies have gently swallowed the price rises.
"There are a lot of customers for whom moving is really difficult because their old applications and others are locked in a database closed to catch," says Widenius.
He still believes that the customer is going to be full.
When licence fees increase every year, the customer will sooner or later move to the open source database.
The price is 10-20 percent higher than the previous one, and the service is better because you can easily switch to another database if you wish.
Moreover, many companies are already facing major system changes as they transfer their activities to cloud computing.
At the same time, many exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received €25 million in loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has approximately 115 employees worldwide and is now expected to hire more.
One reason for the EIB's funding was MariaDB's impact on public procurement.
The company has public sector customers such as in the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros every year from databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax money more efficiently," says Paqvalén.
Widenia is annoyed at the waste of money in Finland, for example, in closed healthcare systems when open systems are cheaper, and the subscriber is not at the mercy of a single software company.
Some people say that open source is an ideology, but I think it is a better way to make code.
The Community helps and does something that it does not invent or is unable to do itself.
Widenius, a 55-year-old, is one of the best known promoters of open source code, along with Linux developer Linux Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies to develop successful business models over open source code.
I still have 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this subject.
Italy is stepping up its response to NGO rescue vessels
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations that rescue refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean Sea that they will not be allowed to continue their activities unless they commit to complying with the new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to operate," said the Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, in an interview with La Stampa of the Tornola.
This warning came the day after the confiscation by the Italian authorities of a ship belonging to the German aid organisation, the Jugend Rette, whose crew are suspected of having cooperated with human smugglers to encourage illegal immigration.
The aid organisation which has only been operating for a year refused to comment on the detailed accusations made by the prosecutor Ambrosio Cartos.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area," the organisation announced in a statement published on the social media.
"We will only be able to assess the accusations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had observed the Iuventa organisation Jugend Rette since October.
The crew is suspected of having taken refugees by boat directly from people-smugglers, who re-used the boats.
It is claimed that one such case is only a few kilometres away from the coast of Libya, and this is reflected in a prosecutor's document published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of the proud Italian coastguards who oversee rescue operations in the area, and are motivated by the enthusiasm for assistance.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police force that monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
Which announced on Thursday that he considered the new rules to be unnecessary but acceptable because they do not create "significant changes or obstacles" for the organisation's rescue operations.
Among those who refused to comply with the code of conduct is Nobel Prize-winner Médecins sans Frontières.
Minniti, on the other hand, noted that the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks as a result of the rescue efforts has fallen dramatically, as evidenced by the strengthening of the Libyan coastguard and the fact that cooperation with local mayors is starting to bear fruit.
"In recent days, there has been a light at the end of the tunnel," the Minister said.
He revealed that there are plans to continue discussions this month with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
The seasonal worker is suspected of having killed his partner, Enontekiö, the suspect was found in the ground - a case for the prosecutor
The suspected crime took place in the Kuttas of Enontekiö last December.
According to the police, a 36-year-old man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish unmarried partner.
It has been said in the past that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that the suspect would have fled the terrain with two dogs after he had done his work.
The man was found in the cold landscape and he did not resist when he caught.
The case must be brought within less than a week.
The case may still be thrashed out at the district court in Lapland during August.
Robert Hardy, well known of Harry Potter and all his friends, has died
Robert Hardy, a British student, died at the age of 91.
The actress's death was announced on Thursday by her family.
Born in 1925 Hardy began his career as an actor at the age of 24 in the theatre.
During his long career he also played in movies and on television.
Hardy will be remembered in particular for the role of the magistrate Mr Cornelis Toffee in the Harry Potter films and for his veterinary role in the television series of all my friends based on James Herriot's book.
The BBC's popular series was filmed for a total of seven periods.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to prison for text messages inciting suicide
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment for texting and telephone calls when she was considered to have incited her boyfriend Conrad Roy to suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months of his sentence in prison and five years on parole.
In June, Carter was convicted of manslaughter. His boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said during a Thursday session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter applied for an appeal and was able to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was threatened with a sentence of 20 years but, according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy are suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red-haired trousers and in a cream-coloured bag, listened to his judgment's hands in cross with a weeping gaze on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He decided the life of Conrad to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the action, "the prosecutor continued.
"He has not shown repentance."
According to the Carter's lawyer, this incident was the result of 'tragic circumstances which Carter deeply regrets'.
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz took the view that Carter's "age or maturity level and even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions."
The prosecutor read the statement by Lynn Roy, the mother of Conrad, in which her mother said that "it doesn't take a day for me to mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I manage all of this. I'll do my best to comfort his sister in this pain that we will always bear. "
The sister of CONRAD, Camdy Roy, was right to say that he was "persecuted" by the idea that he would never see his brother's wedding or be a aunt to his children.
"It is painful to lose a person who has been in my life every day since I was born. That pain never ceases," said Camdy.
This case seems to be setting a precedent, because there is no law in the state of Massachusetts which says that inciting suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in the car for carbon poisoning in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it became clear that Carter had incited his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
I don't know there are many ways, "Carter wrote in many messages he had sent to Royle during the two weeks before this death. Roy was then on holiday with his family.
Just before Roy's suicide Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to launch a generator, and you are free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter took notice of Roy's death. The judge ordered that Carter would not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
This case has divided experts.
Few have defended Carter; one of the defensemen is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of a British fellow Member in Italy in 2007 and released two years later.
Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion paper saying: "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary-General: Get the worst off Russia since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented the NATO Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, "said Stoltenberg in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped to be able to seek close cooperation with Russia.
But since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the continuing instability caused by Russia in eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO remains committed to ensuring that tensions do not peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid an escalation and a new Cold War.
Prior to Mr Stoltenberg's comments, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, came to the conclusion that the US-Russia gap had even reached a dangerous level.
Mr Trump called for thanks to the poor loose congress of the countries, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
Audi will make changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to a setback experienced by car manufacturers;
The day before the Audi announcement BMW offered to upgrade over 350,000 car software.
The leader of BMW said that he believed that "there are more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions." He referred to European cities, including the town of BMW in Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it would make changes to more than 3 million Mercedes engines in order to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke of a call-back.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to achieve their CO2 emission targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
Installation costs for anti-polluting devices will increase, making it difficult to price cars in a competitive way.
German car manufacturers are under strict surveillance, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of pandering to the large car companies and of ignoring the problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen. Volkswagen replaced cars with cheats that cut emissions into line with the regulations in the tests. In ordinary driving, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States, but the actions of leaders are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former Director-General of the Audi Motor Development Department for thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
ZACCHEO Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, may be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen and the authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system to circumvent Europe's emissions requirements in his cars, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The Audi's investigation may significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: Volkswagen's profits represent a disproportionately high proportion of the manufacturers of luxury cars.
The vote in Venezuela started a fraudulent investigation, massive demonstrations in a promise
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role to play in the election results, Mr Tibisay Lucenan, President of the National Election Committee, told the journalists.
Maduro to assure end of crisis
In a controversial vote in Venezuela on Sunday, a delegation was elected to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and has held demonstrations against its change.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would take place at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais, the national security forces in the country began to take over local time on Wednesday evening to take over the parliament building.
The force is intended to ensure the security of the nomination ceremony.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Laval has become a symbol of the Provence region in southern France, but it is now under threat from climate change.
Laval had been reduced due to drought and disease-bearing insects, and scientists and farmers are desperately trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Laval is positively endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered the effects of climate change in recent years, causing a clear decrease in rainfall this spring and especially in the autumn," says Eric Chaisse, an agricultural specialist at CRIEPM in Provence.
"This shortens the life expectancy of lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought a lot of small casks to the area which spread the microbacteria. "
The stakes are high.
It is attractive to tourists and it is also a highly desirable ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of long signs and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed, poorly developed or lacking in size," says Chasissa.
In other words, there are fewer and fewer items containing essential oil.
The solution is to improve irrigation, to slow down the evaporation of soil moisture and to spray plants with a mixture of clay and water. In addition, to develop more sustainable varieties of drought.
The murder of the journalist reflects the growing threat in Mexico
The Rio newspaper, which appears once a week, usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how to deal with the most recent cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and endless drug wars in the state of Sinalo.
Today, however, we are discussing security in the light of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been invited to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists are discussing which is safer: Leave children at home or involve them in a delivery that was the subject of a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the league table at the front of the room: Opponents, neutral, allies.
They ask journalists to name each category. No evidence is needed, observations and sensations are sufficient.
They write the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on government or drug cartels pay, criminals who make the news of chaos in Mexico life-threatening.
According to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012.
The most recent victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, journalist and inspiration of Rio de Janeiro.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote together about many of his books dealing with drug violence.
The façade of the Ridoce building is covered by a huge image in which Valdez looks at the middle.
The meeting will take place less than two months after the death of Mr Valdez. Journalists will discuss their collective trauma, nightmares, their insomnia and their fears of persecution.
In 2010, a Federal Public Prosecutor's Office was set up specifically to deal with journalists' cases but, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two charges have so far been brought.
Journalists are rarely brought to justice, just as few of the thousands of murders connected with drug trafficking and organised crime each year are brought to justice.
The journalists at Rio will continue to write about the violence in Sinalo, even though they are crushed by grief and the situation is even more dangerous.
Mr Ibarra said that there is little point in having a security conference because the killers are unknown and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the reason for the event."
Valdez had left the Rio door on 15 May 2017 in Culiacano, the capital of the State.
He had been driving to the red Toyotala for only a few blocks when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots, presumably linked to the newspaper's name: Rio means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove him out by the vehicle of Valdez, knocking him down a distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was grieved by her wife and two adult children.
Rumours are moving quickly and wobbly freely in Culiacan.
However, we are falling silent about the death of Valdez.
Sinalo has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and expelled to the United States in January, and rival groups want to fill the vacuum.
In the streets of Sinalo, someone or several people are shot to death every day, and the cemetery has decorated two-fold graveyards of drug barons that are larger than many homes.
In an coastal state, there is' calm 'when only one cartel rules over ports and the routes of drug trafficking to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and leader of Rio, the 60-year old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty of not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Rio published an interview with Damas Lopez, leading a rival grouping to fight the sons of Guzman.
The story could get angry with the boys of Guzman: Every issue of the magazine was bought by suspected members of the gang as soon as the newspaper entered the outlets.
Another mistake was that Mr Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper which published the same article was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is regarded as a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroetes when he decided in 2003 to set up five colleagues with the Riidocen. The magazine's shares were sold at that time on $50.
In Sinaloa "it was impossible to make journalism without addressing the drugs problem," says Bojorquez.
Over time, the magazine started to feel its brave and honest stuff, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish a hard-class investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by articles in the press that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its creation, Rio won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for its news in Latin America.
In the same year, Mr Valdez received the prize of the International Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in following the Mexican drug trade saga with constant attention.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said when he received the Prize of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
In Sinalo, the drug trade is a "way of life," Mr Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"The journalist has to take on the job that falls on him - or show a fool.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was sown here - why didn't I say what was going on? "
The staff of the Ridoce miss Valdez - a joker cursed like a dockyard worker - looking for a friend who always had a hug and advice; they need a teacher who knew how to cope.
They trusted in his routines.
He always used a panamahat.
He went to a bar opposite El Guayabo and always sat at the same table.
Now they are asking whether the routines were to his fate.
The death of a colleague has also caused them to reflect on how best they can do their job and stay alive.
Criminals do not like it if we deal with their women and children and their clean business, their secret drugs trade runways.
They were excluded, "says Bojorquez.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection,
Relying on your own instincts.
If you feel that everything is not right, you must stay away.
The problem, according to the journalist Andres Villarral, is that 'the impression can be disappointed, and that is what happened in the Javier case'.
The old rules no longer apply to Sinalo, nor do they apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: Attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to enter the room where the Rio Safety Training was held; a few days earlier it had emerged that only spyware sold to governments had been used to monitor activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought refuge in a tree from a pearl of 40 degrees.
The State Government had ordered them to guard the Rio headquarters, which are located in a four-round building in the middle-class region of Culiac.
Some journalists were half-joking whether these two policemen were in the 50% that the Governor of the State did not consider reliable.
It had been months since journalists visited mountainous rural areas controlled by drug gangs.
This week's Rio Platform gave three main events.
The Boxing Church was killed by Julio Cesar Chavez's brother.
The magazine also intended to reveal that the government's spending was concentrated in the Governor's home town.
In addition, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, only the quarter away from the public prosecutor's office, was a kidnapped group of people.
There was no official knowledge of who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed with caution: Everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular both with drug dealers and with the authorities.
The journalist found out in public documents that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling institutional revolutionary party, the PRI, which has dominated Mexican policy at all levels for nearly a century.
The governors involved have recently been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarral asked a journalist to write earlier cases in the same place, and one of them was the son of El Chapo, the son of Guzman, who managed to escape and avoid a military raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known reliable information about the Valdez column on the abduction.
"In the past, we would have known what had happened," says Villarral, a 46-year-old, who has been kept alive by the nickname "El Flaco," Ohukainen.
"Now all links to our sources of information are gone."
Mr Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse containing signs and labels that combat the persecution of journalists.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with him when he left the morning before the local public prosecutor's office for a demonstration following another journalist's murder.
Salvador Adam disappeared in the Western state of Michacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found which, according to the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adam.
Journalists have started to protest louder throughout the country, and there are 'SOS Press' texts on pavements and buildings.
Today, Mr Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to gain international support for the Valdez investigation.
On the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez met the Governor of Sinalo and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since requested that he be removed from the government case because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in his anger.
Mr Valdez had repeatedly said that in Mexico, journalists are surrounded by organised crime, criminal authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Nark journalism Valdez writes that journalists are killed by drug gangs, but they are also killed on the orders of politicians and security forces, in agreement with organised crime.
According to the articulo 19 monitoring group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by the police and the authorities.
In Mexico, people are silenced by killing, "says Ramirez.
Murder has a crippling effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger, Maria Elizabeth Macias, in the north of the Tamaulipas border, six years ago.
His body was born with a message signed by the Zetas cartel: 'I am here because of my writings'.
Next to his cut off head, there was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to close, such as the El Norte newspaper in the north border state of Chihuahua following the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Break in March.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, whose leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published on its front page a message to the drug cartels: 'What do you want about us?'
Some journalists have fled their states or the country as a whole.
It is a difficult decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find work, and you have to be on your guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals look for a journalist, as apparently happened to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015, three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra - once supposed to become a poet - admits that writing about drug trafficking is a deterrent.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, on Friday, on midnight, the Rio journalists sat in front of the editorial on the foot of the beer when the latest number of the newspaper had been completed, and suddenly their phone started to be a sign of colour.
19 people had died in the shooting between competing gangs and security forces at the Mazatlan beach holiday destination.
The war intensified, as promised in the cartel communications that were found in the area.
The journalists put the news on the Ridoce website from the foot on their smartphone.
The front page was to be renewed the following day.
Sirene can burst in the vicinity - another shooting attack.
Bojorquez looked at the police guards who guard the delivery:
If they were afraid, they covered it very well.
The delivery of the Ridoce continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrayal where the man displays the central standards of the whole of Sinalo.
Mr Bojorquez says that you cannot even consider stopping. "How can I close a newspaper when our trainee asked to go to the street the same day that Javier had been murdered?"
The project of Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge setback - 'The Home'.
In April, the celebration of Hannu Manninen, who was 39 years old, was brief, as a professional pilot started preparations for the Olympic spirit.
However, the season began in a catastrophic way when Manninen was ill with the flu.
It started a long period of illness, which lasted almost five weeks.
May went virtually all the way when ill.
First there was the flu and finally a baby disease like ear infection, which I had to eat with antibiotics.
I was able to do only 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember when I've been so painful for so long.
It was a tough place when I did not get the benefit of the training, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanomat.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Cup was only authorised in the second week of June, which was reflected in the competitive and top sport research centre in the KIHU taxiing test on 12 June.
In the test the athlete loses his or her skiing on a worm whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes the athlete's fingers in the needle for the lactic acid exhibition.
Last autumn I had to bury 32 minutes, but now I only stayed for 28 minutes.
Came up against the wall, "Manninen says.
For the better
After the initial difficulties, Manninen tells us that he is healthy.
I have carried out a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises in an effort to normalise the metabolism of the body.
Now we have a really good five-week period behind us.
It was also a week and a half from flying home.
I have time to visit the cottage with my family.
During the last season, Manninen took part in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was seen immediately in the opening competition when Manninen rose to the top skiing 18.
Guidelines withdrawn
The Manninen and the main coach of the national team, Petter Kukkonen, have made an exercise and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm of training compared to the previous period.
After the first match, Ruka would have a weekend of three World Cup games.
In December at least one weekend of the World Cup, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January plans should still be included in Seefeld.
Hopefully, after that, the name will be on the Olympic team list, "says Manninen.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be the sixth Winter Olympics on the island.
The most important thing now is to stay healthy, a numerically high-level highlight of gold in Salt Lake City in 2002.
Dinosaur protected against enemies by camouflaging
At first it looks frightening.
Today, the scientists have revealed the first results of research by a Canadian miner on a creature of the size of the rhinoceros, which was so well preserved that the experts call it the dinosaurs Mona Lisa.
It had survived so well that the scientists could even determine that its rich skin was red-brown and had a "problematic past."
According to current Biology, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaurs ever and the best species in the world.
Recently discovered fossil is Nodoaurus, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period 110-112 million years ago.
Scientists regard this remarkably well-preserved fossil fuel as a truly significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic, the armoured vegetarian is the most preserved fossil of its kind ever.
It was found in the Sun Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and was discovered by a miner called Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to examine his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the royal palaeontological Museum of Tyrrel.
For six years, 1 100 kg of salmon were mined there.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
"If you flick your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says Caleb Brown, a science writer, who works as a researcher in the royal museum of Tyrrel.
"It will go down in the history of science of dinosaurs Mona as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
The skin studies found that dinosaurs that eat meat were probably a major threat to this vegetarian, even though they had a armour and reminded walking tanks.
Its white red armor masked it from its predators and was protected by darker and whiter coloured dye from the surface, which still exists in many animals.
According to the experts, it was better able to mix its environment and avoid its enemies, bigger dinosaurs.
110 million years old Nodosaurus hit the headlines in May, and it is now on show at the Royal Palace Space Museum of Tyrrelli.
According to the scientists, it was called the Borealoope Museum's musician Mark Mitchell. Mitchell was part of a team from which it took more than 7 000 hours to dig a dinosaur out.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to determine the images and shape of the tanks and tanks of the body.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by general coloring, where the body is darker than the surface and less light than under.
The observation was still a surprise, because the Borealisopelta is considerably larger than the current animals with a corresponding coloring.
It can be concluded that the dinosaurs that eat meat caught it to such an extent that evolution favoured hiding rather than fighting as a means of survival.
The current animals, such as deer, seed and armadillo, have the same colour; they are considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, which suggests that the Nodos vapour was seriously threatened.
"The predation of a large, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous age were," Brown says.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of Nodoaurus reveals that its skin was red brown.
Scientists will continue to study Nodoaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life. They will, among other things, study the contents of the intestine to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into the river and went to sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
At the time Alberta was as warm as it is today in Florida, and the rivers and seas probably went much further than they are today.
"This Nodosaurus is very significant because its Finnish leather is preserved and it has also survived in three-dimensional original form," says Brown.
"Therefore, it looks almost the same as early Cretaceous
It does not take much imagination to figure it out: If you chip a little eye, you can almost believe it was sleeping. "
The Cretaceous period was the era of thermometers, the great two-legged dinosaurs, who eat meat.
Although their King, Tyrannosaurus rex, or millions of years earlier from Borealishere, its great predecessors may have been able to catch this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, the Acrocanthosasaurus, a 6-hour monster of about 11.5 metres.
The latest findings of the Nodoaurus scientists have been published in Current Biology, which believes that Borealis was washed into the sea after his death and mummized by mud.
It was found in the Sun Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and was discovered by a miner called Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, with leather and armour-armored into the hip.
The Nodoaurus were, on average, five metres long and weighed up to 1 300 kg.
Two half-metre barbed wire from their lava.
Scientists believe that this armoured vegetarian passed through the current Western Canada until its flooded river ran to the high seas.
Its armour has remained in the underwater grave, down to the smallest detail.
Its fossil remains so well preserved that its leather is still left in the tank's bumpy disks along its skull.
Indeed, Mr Greshko wrote in the National Geographic that such preservation is "as rare as a lottery win."
The closer you look at it, the more astonishing it seems to be.
There are still fossilised skins in its skull sets.
The right interest for it is on its side, five toes upwards.
I am also able to calculate its footbase. "
How did an activist learn to answer the question: To whom do the streets belong?
On 9 August 2014, Mrs Ferrell was deeply shocked.
He had arrived in New York the day before from his home in St. Louis and sat in the bed of his airbnb apartment browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high school:
"A young person of just 18 was killed by the police and his body is still on the street."
She was embarrassed to note that no one else had posted the same information in her feed. That's why she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous relaxations from the user @ TheePharoaah.
The user name belongs to a junk resident in St. Louise, who tweaked in real time for the death of Michael Brown. A white police officer had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black person, Brown Ferguson, in Missouri State.
This user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," said Ferrell.
But death was nothing new to him and to his community.
When he returned to Twitter later that night, there were reports that people would gather for the Canfield Drive.
The users posted pictures of police blockades and cries, as well as of a man who claimed to be the father of Brown, carrying a sign carrying the headline: 'My unarmed son was killed by the Ferguson police!'
Ferrell followed a real-time video, where the police stood with a dog barking in front of the demonstrators.
He says that he has also seen a video, in which another policeman took his rifles and shouted: 'I kill all of you... animals'.
"This is not normal," says Ferrell.
"It was not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to, which one might say is typical.
Then I felt the cold colours.
I was angry and I wept. "
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11 o'clock in the evening. Ferrell went to get his six-year-old daughter from his father and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
From what happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson over the next nearly three years, a documentary film has been produced on the "Wheice Streets" of his first night in cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, of love and loss, of strength and perseverance from the point of view of the local people who took to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson Flower and compatible with his crown-dressed daughter, they had another conversation about how to live in black and under what conditions. "They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how the blacks had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I could not ignore the daughter."
"Today's events are... the culmination of past events.
My daughter has the right to know and to grow into it.
He must be able to engage in activism and organization, but he must also feel the different layers and conditions of the black experience, and he must know what we must do to free ourselves.
Although, fortunately, I have been able to protect him from blatant racism, he is still the same as other black girls.
It seems to me that I would hurt him if I protected him from reality. "
Their first staging point in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, opposite the police station, which became a camp for activists waiting for information on the case and finally found out that no charges would be brought against the police.
From there Ferrell and his daughters went to help the local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunch in their bags and delivered them to the demonstrators.
Ferrell started to take a new approach to activism.
When he studied at the University of Missouri in St. Louis Ferrell was the chairman of a minority nurse student organisation. At that time, he focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience of organization.
Somehow it just happened. "
Weeks later, Ferrell, during an evening demonstration, met Sabah Folayan, a documentary assistant director.
Folayan said that he and the photographer, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, wanted simply to tell what was happening.
Mr Ferrelli was sceptical; he asked: 'Do you really want to tell us what is happening, or do you want a story that you can use?'
The doubt was cast on countless occasions when people had appeared in the local community, usually white people, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born in Ferguson and the tumours had no common voice," Folayan said in a recent interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted his deputy director, Damon Davis, known for his activism in the prisoners condemned to death.
The presence of Mr Davis led Mr Ferrelli to join the project together with six other local authorities, who followed events in the years following the shooting of Mr Brown.
"This is not a document that someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak," Mr Davis says.
"For me, the most important thing was how the local people are shown in the film, because I am presented in the same way."
According to Folayan, it was not the intention to focus on the experiences of Ferrelli, because they wanted to show that the popular movement "is not about the charismatic leader but about the Community." Ferrell, however, proved to be more transparent.
This is why the documentary shows the unexpected private aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as love and marriage.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when he told me how it seemed to see the film for the first time.
"But I understood that this work and the human image of the black require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrelli's story times and re-focuses on the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born in social media (# BlackLiveMatter) after the police had shot the black teenager boy, Trayvon Martin, in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with the queer identity.
"The leadership of the black queer women has kept the whole movement going," says Ferrell. "It's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything. "
Folayan agrees that this movement is indeed being maintained by black women, among whom there are many queer women.
However, he points out that Ferrelli was not elected for 'an end in itself' because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folayan says.
"However, it is not by chance that he was on the front line. The black queer women live in many areas of surgery and have a lot to play with.
His energy comes from a white fabric. "
The press description teams submitted Ferguson a long time ago, but relations between the Community and the police remain tense.
Mr Ferrelli still had two and a half years to run and was sentenced for blocking the motorway during the demonstration.
His description of the climate of social policy in his homelands is short and concise: 'A mess'.
Yet he still trusts in the slogan he learned from the outside on Ferguson streets three years ago:
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains. "
Suitable uniformity: The artist creates portraits of the DNA of Chelsea Manning
The Fridman gallery, located in New York, has been hung up in the middle of the exhibition space with faces - white, black and brown faces, from which one can see a closer look.
These 30 works are portraits by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from the cheeks and hair of Chelsea Manning.
Mr Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth's prison, where he served 35 years of sentence, and he was sentenced to leaking of secret diplomatic telegrams to the WikiLeaks site.
The Dewey-Hagborg A becoming resemblance exhibition was opened on 2 August 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmly and created 30 portraits based on his genetic information. It is a sharp, though somewhat theoretical, statement on the adaptability, ambiguity, and causality and the underlying cause-relations of DNA interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly reported that he identified with women from the age of puberty, found guilty of 20 crimes in 2013, including espionage, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning, sentenced to prison: The rocket, the black and white selfie, where the tormented Manning is sitting in the driver's seat in the car.
Dewey-Hagborg had behind it a highly popular project called 'Stranger Visions' in 2015, which he carried out in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data. He obtained DNA data on tobacco darkens and chewing gums, for example, and created images of how the people concerned could have looked.
Then the artist received an email from the paper Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed an image of his story," Dewey-Hagborg reported at a new exhibition briefing.
So the newspaper contacted Chelsea asking whether he would be interested in making the manning a DNA portrait.
The artist and the other person who was imprisoned suddenly became correspondents and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even together produced a short-pressed Images cartoon, illustrated by Shoil Kanungo, describing the future where the President would have relaxed Chelsea's verdict and would have access to the exhibition.
In reality, Obama reduced his sentence only a few days after the publication of a cartoon book, which was a fortunate coincidence after seven hard years in a national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened at a time when Donald Trump is waging his own war against data-makers and transgender soldiers and on Twitter he is finding more and more ways of strengthening the strong divisions which he actually had to alleviate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has its purpose."
On the wall of the gallery there is an artist's statement and under it Manning's great nickname with my surname at the heart.
On the opposite wall there is the DNA section of the Manning: A long queue of C, G, and A letters written in a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters - or nucleotides, as the scientific definition used by the artist - the Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are all, at least from our biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal to our genetic heritage and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretation," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"DNA tells countless stories. Here's 30 of them."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: The cartoon of Page Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
In this respect, the figure of Manning is rising from prison like King Kong, in his hand, megaphone.
"If they can silence you, they have won," says the picture.
"Don't be silent ever."
"The text is a letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold colors."
Unlike the cartoon book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning comes, he was greeted with a face based on his own genetic information as a group of demonstrators in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is deliberate, like everything else in this exhibition: For example, the DNA section of the mainland is written on a pencil height equal to its length (157.5 cm).
"The face was previously on the wall, but I wanted to make it felt by a group of people," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to describe the mass movement created by Chelsea, which was also behind his release."
Professor at Northwestern University and a member of the University of Oxford are sought for murder suspects
The police say that they have set up a national search to find a professor at the University of Northwestern and an employee at the University of Oxford, suspected of having stabbed a man to death in a luxury school in Chicago.
The Cook District Court documents show that on Monday arrest warrants were issued against Wyndham Lathis, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranau, who have been issued for first instance without a guarantee of murder.
According to the papers of Cornell-Duranau, 26, died after he was stabbed several times.
According to a local report published by the Chicago Police Department, the room was found on 27 July 2017.
The police officers who were alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building discovered a victim who had several cut injuries in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duraneau was found dead at the scene of the incident and the case is being investigated as a murder, and two suspects are actively sought by the police.
He has been an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Norwegian University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-Chancellor of the University for Social Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now exempt from administration and has been denied access to the campus at Northwestern University.
"This is a criminal case being investigated by the authorities, and the Northwestern University is helping the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
An e-mail statement from the University and the Somerville College states that "we have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to assist the US investigating authorities in any way we can."
In addition, the statement said that the Members of Warren were shocked and hoping that he would surrender.
Anthony Gugliuis, Chief of Information at the Chicago Police Department, said that he would urge suspects seriously to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, and we are constantly refining our searches," said Guglielmi.
According to the Guglittes, local, regional and national authorities help in the search for suspects.
He reported that the police had received a call from a host of the Grand Plaza Building, which had received a vague hint that something had happened in the apartment in 1008.
The police described the presence on the scene as terrible.
According to Mr Guglimu, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said that the security cameras had revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza Executive Group published the following press release to the population: 'The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence'.
Man threatened to blow up the Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic," said the convicted policeman.
The Moffatt must perform a hundred hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of his threats to blow up the Islamic bookshop in London and 'kill all Muslims'.
According to the Independent magazine David Moffatt, among other things, was convicted of gross harassment.
According to the police, they were alerted by the staff of the bookstore on May 23.
According to the staff, the man had "threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims."
The suspect left the shop after threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police for intimidation.
The intimidation did not relate to events in the book trade.
The authorities found that Moffatt was wearing the same suit as the alleged victim of the book trade, said the police officer.
I am not an anti-Muslim, I am a Catholic, Moffatt said to the police during interrogations.
As a punishment, a man must perform a hundred hours of unpaid social service and pay GBP 620 or approximately EUR 690 and GBP 85, or approximately EUR 95, compensation for the victims.
According to Scotland Yard's spokesman, several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the World Anti-Doping Agency's Road Map, under the WADA Roadmap, which will restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"Some of the measures under the roadmap have already been implemented and the RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Commission (UKAD).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in these respects, "Muko stated on Thursday.
Commenting on the second part of WADA's road map, which sets out the conditions for restoring the authority of the RUSADA, the second part of which was recently published on the organisation's website.
Let us remember that it contains nothing worrying for Russia.
"Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future. "
However, one of the points on the road map requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the findings of a study carried out by WADA and by a Canadian lawyer, Richard McLaren, who is investigating the alleged role of the state in doping in sport in Russia.
To that, he said: 'Research is under way because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes and we cannot admit what did not exist. "
The words of others echo the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, President of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
Mrs Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian sports media earlier the same day, admitted that there were problems with the Russian anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial statements and provisions.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally, "he added, however.
WADA ordered the RUSADA to end doping in Russia in November 2015, after the extent of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
The Director of WADA, Olivier Niggli, visited the headquarters of the RUSADA in Moscow in July, after which he stated that the agency was "on the right track" towards the restoration of powers.
British organisation skeptical about the innovation of Finnish loved ones: There is "no evidence"
A British organisation doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
The BBC and Guardian, for example, are saying that the Lullaby Trust, which is fighting against death by hand, prohibits the use of their own brochures on maternity packaging distributed in Britain.
Maternity package will be distributed to all pregnant women this month in Scotland.
In England too, packaging is distributed in some regions.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that maternity packaging reduces the risk of death by hand.
Death by hand means the child's unexplained sudden death.
Lullaby Trust is an expert on the British health authorities on the safe dream of a child.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packaged in them, because it would suggest that we recommend this product, they informed us.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, only two dead per 1000 people born.
According to Lullabby Truti, Finland's good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as the low number of teenage pregnancies.
The fact that there is given to every family a box may be one factor.
But that cannot be said for sure, Francine Bates, CEO of Lullabby Trust said.
We are concerned that maternity packaging is being marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and infant mortality.
Maternity package is a Finnish invention and has been given free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The pack contains a variety of accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products on the pack.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust, for its part, says that there are no safety standards for cardboard boxes as a sleeping place.
According to Lullabby Truti, packaging can be the best option for sleeping place if there is no cradle or soil bed available.
The organization recommends that you only use the packaging for daydreams and stop using it when the child is able to convert.
The organisation also recommends keeping pets out of the package and ensuring that it does not get wet or dirty.
Vikkelä was once again attacking the Japanese Zoo
The staff of a Japanese zoo are looking for a hardening turtle.
The giant turtle has been surprised by the speed of the staff and has for the second time escaped within two weeks.
The turtle ran away from the Shibukawa zoom in western Japan on Tuesday morning.
The cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, told Yoshim Yamane, who is working in the zoo.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is female, 55-kilo and about a metre-long.
Yamane describes the candy as quiet and gentle.
In the opening hours the villas can move freely in the wise area.
The zoo has not received any eye-witness keys from the turtle.
The last candy of the frog happened the other week.
Yamane found the candy to walk along the road 150 metres from the zoo.
I noticed it on my way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, "said Yamane.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your company to avoid Uber errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at the start-up company of the online shop, but the questionnaires did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he confirmed that the questionnaires were anonymous, they were viewed with suspicion by some workers.
"The enquiries were simply neither consistent nor objective," says Errett.
Errett decided to rely on outside help.
More and more new start-ups in human resources management have entered the market to help other companies find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that measure employee engagement; companies can conduct surveys and target specific groups and population groups, provide anonymous reporting services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact over the top management board.
"You can monitor your health with applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is the delay for companies Fitbit?" Asks the founder and CEO of Glint Bar in Redwood City to measure the commitment of their employees.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years. He says he has gained a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The programme can make quick enquiries and votes to certain groups, and it can draw up a map showing at a glance which departments are most dissatisfied with the employees and which managers received the weakest assessments, which has allowed Errett to get to the heart of the problems.
Companies have realised that they need to follow a workplace culture so that they do not become the next Uber. The transport company has been in turmoil since a former employee wrote in his blog about a culture where workers are harassed and people who talk about problems are punished.
For startups such as Glint, such negligence is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry which, according to the let's Talk Payens website, could reach more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020.
The company's interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation was damaged.
It has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla, for example.
It also recently concluded an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent gives companies the opportunity to make tailored enquiries, collect answers confidentially in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can declare their improper behaviour anonymously by SMS.
And if the director is suspected of not doing so, complaints go directly to the company's Board of Directors.
"Public opinion has been superseded by the authorities," says Patrick Quinn, founder and CEO of Convercenti.
She points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences may be costly, even if the authorities do not intervene, and consumers may start boycotting the company, and they may also lose their employees and be taken to court.
Ruby Tuesday has more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations. The company has been using Convercenti for over a year, because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the operating principles and procedures and can easily access the headquarters.
In the past, the practice was that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to first find out his phone number or email address to make a notification to the headquarters, and then he had to make an official complaint and hope it was taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, the legal director of Ruby Tuesday.
In the past, the problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state; problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay can now be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive picture of the reality of the employee," says Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"At the same time, we are protecting our shareholders from labour market litigation."
According to Mr Quinlan, companies started to take ethics, values and employee commitment even more seriously after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of an ethical business in the Enron scandal.
It was only with the help of social media that companies realised that they could no longer prevent their dirty products from being publicly cleared up.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under the control of ethics," says Quilan.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for use.
It is a business model and an opportunity accepted by capital investors. Both Glint and Convercenti are backed by capital investors.
In February, Convercent collected $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and tola Capital, raising capital for a total of $47 million.
In November, Glint received EUR 10 million from the Bessel Venture Partnership and has collected a total of USD 60 million in funding.
Investment comes as no surprise, given the links between companies, business culture and risk capital.
According to numerous studies, workers expect more of their jobs.
In a competitive market such as Silicon Valley, good wages are high and interesting projects are only the beginning.
Workers want to feel accepted and valued and give their time to a company that is genuinely useful.
"Employees are more committed to the company's success if they feel they are being listened to and rewarded," says Nina McQueen, the Director of LinkedIn, responsible for rewarding and well-being.
Investors get a return when companies are successful. Companies are successful when employees engage.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen the commitment of employees, so it is no wonder that they are of interest to investors.
Experts in the workplace culture say that information about the commitment of employees is important,
But that is useless unless action is taken on that basis.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered as a sign of change.
And if change does not occur quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment may decrease the commitment of employees.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand debates," says Russell Raath, Director-General of the company consulting on business management, who has seen companies relying too heavily on simply collecting information.
"If a company fails to act, the employees begin to consider whether they were consulted
And whether their opinions matter anything.
If a company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company? "
According to Errett, Madison Reed currently carries out personnel inquiries on a monthly basis and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as the one announced in Glint.
Once Errett had collected feedback from employees frustrated by the slow decision-making process and the quality of communication, he was able to make changes to teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that deeper understanding will help to improve the long-term sustainability of staff in a sector known as high employee turnover.
"If a company does not commit to a culture of transparency, it loses its employees," says Vitrano.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers there are no companies. "
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of poaching his naked female neighbour, according to the news agency TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had gone away from the shower at home when she had noticed a bull hanging outside her window.
According to a woman, the mobile camera described the apartment.
The woman who was shocked by this incident had run into another room to dress.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon after that the window was re-laid.
A 20-year-old man suspected of spying has admitted that he has described a woman.
However, he claimed that he only described the face of a woman.
The video on the mobile phone had been deleted and the police had not managed to restore it as evidence.
In interrogations, the man has admitted the act, but denied the crime.
The man's description was justified by saying that he loves his neighbour as "absolutely crazy."
According to the news agency TT, the case is prosecuted.
Teachers call for more detail in autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the gap should be narrowed, "said Olli Luukkanen, Chairman of the OAJ, on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to enter into agreements where the review does not in any way involve cuts in holiday money.
Contracts in the field of municipalities are only awarded once private sector papers have been signed and the rates of increase have been identified.
The Luke predicts, for example, that the working conditions of the OAJ were agreed in January.
The promotion goals were not yet revealed by Luke.
Luukkanen is also President of the Association of Public Educational Skills.
Luxembourgish: Pay gap
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show a decline in the purchasing power of public sector employees, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luke, a temporary holiday cut will exacerbate the differences in income.
The number of pupils per teacher must be determined in Finland;
The OAJ also points out that the equality of basic education must be ensured, as differences between the best and the weakest are growing all the time.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are deteriorating and differences between pupils and regions are constantly increasing.
The Bruins players day longer when the NCAA reduced the daily exercises from two to one
It will soon be eleven o'clock in the evening.
Some have removed their shirts. Their backs are glittering from the sand after the limb of the first day of the training camp.
Time for many of them this few minutes chat session is a break from midday.
After three hours of training, players who study the university's summer courses return to their homes to read the final examinations. The next morning they will meet half-seven in the Wassermon football centre.
"The next three days are going to be tough for these guys," says Jim Mora, the coach in Bruins, shortly before Monday's change takes place on Tuesday.
The umbrella organisation of university education reduced the number of day-to-day training cards from two to one. The change was to reduce the workload of the players, but it has extended their days - at least until Friday, when the final tests will be held.
That is why the first three UCLAF exercises began with a guard of more than seven in the evening.
Limiting the number of training sessions to one day means that there are more training days.
These exercises are planned 18 times before 20 August, when the actual preparations for the opening of the season will begin: UCLAF will meet in September at the University of Texas A & M.
The MORA says it supported the NCAA rule change, even though it made the players' schedules even more stringent.
"We put a huge burden on them for three or four days, and that is a great challenge," says Mora.
"But the players are ready to work. They're great guys.
I believe that things will be easier when we get to Saturday, and then we will have more time.
It is not easy, given the direct sight of the training area next to the parking area and the Luski Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombed on a network of shelters above the ground station.
Bruins players are expected to change to their hotel this coming weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are outside available.
"We have security arrangements," says Mora.
"The worry is that people can book a room and photograph exercises on the video. It's not an exaggerated concern.
There is quite a lot to be paid for the video screened for the exercises.
But we have guards there and in the car park.
We will do our best.
I am not going to trouble my head too much.
We have a plan. "
Freedom in Rwanda
On Friday, presidential elections will be held in central Africa, the winner of which is already considered clear.
Paul Kagame is trying officially for his third term, but in practice he has been influencing the country's leadership since 1994.
At that time, the rebel group RPF put an end to the organised genocide of the extremists.
Kagame was the commander of RPF.
Kagame has been criticised for, among other things, crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of speech.
He has also been accused, for example, of distorting poverty statistics.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to make an effort, because the Constitution, which limited the Presidency to two terms, was amended.
However, in Rwanda, Kagame is also a genuinely held leader.
During his time in Rwanda social reforms have taken place and international investment has flowed.
Furthermore, Kagamon has played a major role in the reunification of a country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African countries.
However, even Kagamas well has promised its people more freedom after the country has been lifted on its feet.
Now could be a good time to start.
Facebook is fighting false news by stepping up the verification of facts
Facebook intends to send potential false news more and more to independent fact inspectors and present the results below the original article. The world's largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using the updated machinery to identify false news. Possible false news will be sent to fact inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the biggest distributors of false news, and many believe that the false news affected the result of the US presidential election in 2016.
The subject has come up for political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with false news before the presidential elections in May and Germany in preparation for September supports a plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook, in a separate opinion published in Germany, announced that the fact-finding tests are being carried out in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories don't pass through the screening of independent inspectors. They also want more background information to be able to decide more enlightened what they read and share," Sara Su, the Head of the Facebook news item, wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test related articles on the -function and make other changes to its news item in order to reduce false news.
The birth of a cartoon: The History of a Castle
A small Scotney castle in Kent is now known by the music video of Squeez and Margaret Thatcher's hiding place from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of turbulent history behind it, and now this charming castle in the Bewli river valley is the subject of a cartoon letter written by Jamie Rhodes, the old man of mopeds who likes old documents.
"I think it is great to be able to study the text written by someone who died more than 300 years ago," Rhodes says with his cataract.
"I feel personally connected when I hold the letter in my hand."
The book by Rhodesi, A Castle in England, describes the stories of the families of those living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the educasian period, illustrated by a different artist, a promising British photographer: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Brickley, Mayor of Mayor of Wimbleley.
This is not the first book based on archives in Rhodesi. In 2014, Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, whose inspiration was the documents of the National Library of Britain.
"I was moved to tears when I saw the thumb in the letter. It was written by a double agent working on the Jacobins in the 1700s," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell of smoke, because at that time the fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love archives! "
The writer who used the old documents was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council of England, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent the days studying the "new" castle, archives, treasures and rarities, such as mosquitoes hanging on walls and bottles hanging for centuries.
He travelled through the ruins and accounts of the old castle and talked with forest guards, gardeners and, at times, artists who depict the book.
In the evenings he "took whisky and began to write."
The closer history of Scotland is rather unknown, as the city was only transferred to the National Trust Foundation after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Husseyn, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived around ten years later, the staff of the Foundation were only starting to go through the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held for hundreds of years using the same method: To take all the extra pieces of revenue.
In the archives there were logbooks, letters from the days of the English Empire and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that the land crossings are dull," Rhodes says. "However, here the families were fighting up to one birch.
It occurred to me that it would not be allowed to be already. '
Some of the stories in the book go from the castle to the history of England, as The Labour. It is about a man who, shortly after the castle was completed, will join the British peasant rebellion in 1381.
"The Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," says Rhodes.
"The uprising of the peasants in England began in the same area, and it occurred to me that the rebellion could begin with riots.
Perhaps these events are connected? "
Other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle - such as The Priest, the story of a priest that the Darrell family hidden for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of the smugglers Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, who is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his tomb was opened).
The Darrelles are the favourite family of Rhodesis in Scotland. "The men of the family seem to have been quite young men. They constantly went into debts and bought things they could not afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by getting married to the wealthy old women. I see them as great guys who were able to beat the peripheries. "
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experience.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a cartoon book on Life at the beginning of the 20th century, of which only an eutrophication plot remains.
Scotland Castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave," he says.
"I didn't want to return to this day of evil."
Relations with Russia - the worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented the NATO Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, "said Stoltenberg in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped to be able to seek close cooperation with Russia.
But since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the continuing instability caused by Russia in eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO remains committed to ensuring that tensions do not peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid an escalation and a new Cold War.
Prior to Mr Stoltenberg's comments, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, came to the conclusion that the US-Russia gap had even reached a dangerous level.
Mr Trump called for thanks to the poor loose congress of the countries, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitshko ends - no repeat match against Anthony Joshua
Vladimir Klitslung, a long-standing heavy-duty world champion, will finish his career.
Klitshko, Ukraine, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
At the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Klitslung struck a as a professional with 69 times winning 64 matches.
He held various World Cup titles between 2000 and 02 and 2006-15.
Klitsko lost the last two matches of his career.
She was awarded points by Tyson Fury in November 2015.
In April of this year, the Klitslung met Anthony Joshua at the Wembley Stadium and lost at the 11th batch after a fierce match.
Joshua and Klitslung were expected to meet at a repeat match in November in Las Vegas.
But Klitslung did not find motivation for the match.
I deliberately used a few weeks of decision to distance myself sufficiently from the Wembley match, Klitslung reported in his communiqué.
I reached everything I dreamed of as an amateur and professional boxer, and now I want to start my second career after sport.
I could never have imagined having such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitsko's reasoning for its decision by video.
Bernd Bönte, the manager of Klitshko, reported that the decision to close the case was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has sufficient motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, Mr Böge said.
Klitshko has been in contact with the US actor Hayden Panteleren since 2009.
The couple has one child, a daughter Kaya born in 2014.
Klitslung's Big Brother Vitali is also a former heavy-duty world champion.
In 2008-12 the brothers ruled the World Cup title at the same time.
The weather crusher in Finland gets into the circumstances: "Take the filistic"
Inna Nikkanen has suffered conditions during the summer iron season.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with conditions.
The wind and cold have taken a woman's name away.
There are also unstable conditions in the World Cup in London.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
This summer the circumstances have been against Minna Nikka.
I would not like to blame the line, but it was incomprehensible that I could not even get my little hive properly, as Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I have been competing and practicing here knows how many times I have never experienced such a variable wind in this place, Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmi Games.
During this period, it has been very difficult to standardize the jump when there have also been so unstable winds in the exercises, Nikkanen stated in the Kaleva games.
The weather was discussed in London on Thursday.
The time has been challenging to get the technique together - whether it's froze or whatever.
It's been cold and windy and it's been taken from the fictional.
It makes no sense to consume energy in poor circumstances.
Thanks to his grey-type 455, he got into the World Cup.
Out there are 445.
The situation in London is not the same for everyone.
You have to be patient and wait for better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 of the Friday cut.
Why do you need to train abroad?
It is not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany during the early part of the season.
I got a jump on a pile and the technique standardized.
Surely the same should have been done now.
Normally you can go to the hall to practice, now the hall has been closed.
What would be the ideal race?
25 degrees warm.
Even a small wind happens, as long as it is constant.
An experienced ex-official slept at politicians in the Yllä: "We have no division now nor for many years"
Despite the favourable economic climate, the government of Mr Sipila must keep a cool head and be careful not to inflate the state budget with debt money, warns Mr Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets for decades.
He said there is no division.
In 2015, YLE interviewed the resident Virta on Wednesday night.
Construction of next year's state budget is just beginning.
Recently, the hotchpotch policy proposals, such as the raising of the guarantee pension, the lowering of the car tax and the support for electric wheels, regard Virtanen as election holidays.
They merely point out that the elections are starting to be close, because when 10% of the state's budget is financed by additional debt, we do not have any margin now and for many years.
I even think it is a betrayal to talk about a pay-as-you-go, Virtanen said to YLE.
Virtanen stressed that all debt owed by children.
Virtase has a long experience in preparing state budgets: In 1978, he started as budget secretary in the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Head of the Budget Department and Head of the Budget.
Last time he retired, he was Head of the Office of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
Virtanen pointed out in the Yle interview that economic growth of 3% is now likely to be temporary.
All commentators estimate that this is a thorn in the origin of going into the lower end as early as next year, and Finland is expecting an increase of 1% for decades.
Washington changes rules on permanent residence
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that a new immigration plan would change the rules of the permanent residence permit, that is, the Green Card.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 a year, to tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and to restrict family visas.
The Republicans have proposed new rules and the President supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce chain immigration and replace the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who know English and can support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy. "
The spouse of the Queen of Denmark does not want to be buried with the Queen in the same place
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
In the picture, Prince Henry and Queen Margaret was described in April.
The Danish queen, Margaret Margaret, 77, and Prince Henrika, her husband, is not buried side by side, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, sovereign couples in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
Today, the royal house has announced that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the Court says in his statement on Thursday.
According to Bt, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the Prince has been unhappy with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, according to Lene Belleby, Chief of Communication of the Supreme.
For Prince's decision not to be buried alongside the Queen is a natural consequence of not being treated on an equal footing with his wife.
The queen has long been aware of the hope of her husband's place of burial and understands the decision.
The car had to come on the motorway
Tomm had an unmarried partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but they will not get the money for insurance unless one party is reached.
In the case of the Kemolanport, the accident occurred in Vantaa.
Look at the ring on the construction site of III.
Tommi from Vantaa tells his family that on Tuesday they miraculously survived a car accident.
Tommi, his partner, Riina, and two small children from the couple drove on the motorway in the case of the Kemolanport in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
The link between the ring III and the Hämeenlinna route was driven by the sense of acceleration along the white car that was driving the family to the village, "says Tommi.
Without the dodgy movement the car would have come onto Tommi's top.
I brake and I was turning the car at the same time, and it went out of hand, "says Tommi.
The family's car came up against the echo at a high speed.
The parents and the two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is just under 3 years old, the other being under the age of one.
It was obviously pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No one who wanted to do so was driving us, even though traffic was so heavy.
The accident took place at around 5.20 p.m.
According to Tomm, no one stopped to them and the family called to the emergency centre.
They got out of the car by their own efforts.
Staff from ambulances and rescue services came to the scene and the condition of the family was checked.
The car went into the redemption function.
Tommi says that he and his partner have a small income and that they received a family grant to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without information from the other car, according to Tommi, the family will not receive any money from the insurance policy.
That is why the family wants eye-witnesses to find out about a car that put the family on the cataract.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take children to the farm and work without it, "says Tommi.
Tommi saw that the car was white, more old car.
It was probably the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 21st century.
In his opinion, the beginning of the car registration number was SIG.
If the guilty party is not caught, I do not know how we are doing financially, we still have to calculate every cent today.
Tommi hopes that those who have seen or know about what has happened are in contact with the police.
The Police Service of Eastern Uusimaa and the Rescue Service of Central Uusimaa confirm that they have had a mission at the scene of the accident on Tuesday evening.
The title and the story were fixed at 9.15 p.m.: Contrary to what was originally reported in the case, another car, according to Tommi, did not come in the lane, but was driven from the accelerator to the family village.
The proposal, under the guidance of Lotta Jäppis, deals with human relations by means of humor - the self-journalist will be seen at What?, in the theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, will bring his preschool to What?
The self-appointed director is a musical theatre performance on past relationships and inadequacy.
According to the director Lotta Jäppis, it still remains a pleasure.
The subject is dealt with by means of humor.
There's no room for bad feelings, "he says.
According to Jäppi, a travelling summer theatre performance has been carried out with a tiny budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the performance challenges us to consider what people reveal about themselves when they visit a new person.
Is he perhaps leading a role, or is he approaching another coat of arms?
Juoneton's performance confuses fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both guided and dramatised the performance.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The proposal is made up of the working group's texts and there is no plot.
The director believes that even if the performance draws from the thoughts of young people, it appeals to all ages.
The Jäppinen stresses that the self-journalist does not directly tell about his or her personal relationships and that of the working group.
Facts and fiction are mixed up.
My world of values is certainly conveyed by the show.
I do not think that human relationships are evil, but neither do I think that human relationships, especially partnership, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the self-help journalist draws a contemporary picture of young adults living in 100-year-old Finland.
According to him, many have learned a lot about relationships between their parents, many of whom have resigned.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You do not need to stay in a bad relationship.
The show includes Minea Lång, Niklas Rauté and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes the aid donor Ella Snellman.
The agreed music is Jäppis and rock.
In Kouvola, love for the theatre
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, is a director of theatre expression at the University of Applied Sciences of Turku in the Academy of Arts.
Behind you are two years and the face of another mokoma.
Jäppsen's enthusiasm for the theatre has begun in the years of Kouvolan.
The educator has been an assistant at Kouvola's theatre and played at high school theatre in Helsinki and most recently in Linnatureter in Turku.
Guidance is becoming more and more interesting.
Last week in Helsinki on the Narr stage, the self-help officer received his first evening.
A performance lasting about 45 minutes is likely to be seen in the future, at least in the town of Jäppis in Turku.
8 p.m. to 7 p.m. and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. at Kouvolan Mikä?
For one year, the Finnish Olympic winner recovered from bitter motor-ocross - her neck has broken down
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable natural force as Janne Lavata.
The Kumaratasku went around the world for hundreds of days a year for two or ten years, chasing his dream of an Olympic horse.
The dream came true in 2002, but the movement of Lalumi continued.
He was not only an indefatigable trainee, but also a experimenter of new species.
There are not many forms of exercise on earth that the chemist's brother would not have tried at least once.
It has inspired them to practice.
There's always something new, "says Lavaa.
In the end, one hobby was to stop Ladoga completely.
In 2014, Laja was involved in a motor accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
"I fell asleep at my home for a year," says Lavra.
Lacolala had bad luck.
He also admits that age could be a part of the evil.
Driving on the Prätkä can sound like a hell.
But I didn't look for boundaries.
It's just a sport so hard that on issues like the square don't pay too much to engage!
After the accident, it was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
The main coach of the Japanese freestyle team was behind.
Lalada started to wash immediately after the end of his career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be in my seat.
I didn't really do very much, "says Lavaa.
At the time of Valmennukanakan, too, Lataja challenged her protection on the slopes and in physics.
Surprisingly, it was a good experience to stop.
I was so tired physically and mentally that my own thoughts did not seem reasonable either.
Not even among the species.
Did good to be in place.
I really enjoyed it because I just got to be for once.
The mandatory break inspired the main coach of Lay Finland.
Without stopping, he fears that he would be burnt to the end.
It is easier to find places that have gone through than whole places!
Without an accident I would not have realised that I needed so much rest.
Lalaa began as a coach for the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby in place of the species.
I changed my motocross from frisbeigolin!
After all, he left the stable straight away.
At worst, I was playing for seven hours a day.
Although Lavra has always been a super-enthusiast, he does not require his coaching to be the same as he does.
I am not forcing everyone into the same mould.
There is room in our species culture to be one's own and to become the best of the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with it, "says Lavat.
Sex robots come and we need to be concerned
It is here: A report on the development of technology in the sex robot sector - just as it had begun to feel that 2017 could no longer be a new year.
Yes.
Sex robots are now the big deal.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics, the FRR, recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5-10 years.
"We must start to take the spread of sex robots seriously," says Emeritus Professor Noel Sharkey Sheffield of the Foundation's founder and Robotics and artificial intelligence.
Customers can choose the colour of the robot's eyes, the shape of their faces and the type of fingers.
"Sex robots are being refined, but are already being sold quite a lot, and we will see more of them," Sharkey said the report at the public session.
The secretions have developed from blowing dolls to robots with apparently warm silicone skin and the features created by artificial intelligence that remind you of human behavior.
The user can also adjust the robot's own preferences from the eye to the shape of the facial and the type and colour of the fingers.
It is all the more worrying that robotics have a "personality" which makes the women of Stepford look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have developed into robots with silicone-skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot may be adapted to the user's preferences, for example, a shyness.
The Roxxy Gold robot, true Company, has a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"The personality of Roxxy Gold adapts as fully as possible to the user's personality," is advertised on the company's website.
In other words, the robot keeps the same things as the user.
It also has different ways of thinking:
It may be tired, something or "in the wind."
There are many worrying features of the increasing prevalence of sex robots, which replace genuine human relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies, as the user approaches robot, which is designed to be shy and resistant.
True Company is like Roxxy robot vibrator on its website:
"Women have a vibrator. Why should men not have a sex robot?"
Sex robots, however, are not just a fetis or a new kind of sex toy.
Their proliferation and development is indicative of something darker and deeper in our culture: A decline in gender equality towards sexual relations, where repression is one option among others.
Of course, the majority of men do not get a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report told them that they were increasingly popular.
However, marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And many start to behave in a strange or offensive manner only when the market permits it.
It is no coincidence that sexual robots are starting to develop at a time when women's rights are under threat in various parts of the world and a President in the White House who has boasted of his harassment of women.
The Handnad's Tale is not the most worrying of its powerful image language, for example, images of the hanged body and out of the dud eyes. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the world feels.
The republic of Gilead is far removed from reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Attempts are being made to make sex robots as much as technically possible as real women.
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and movements to mimic human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot cannot leave the relationship or the situation.
They do not have their own will or history - they do not violate the fantasy of independence or total surrender.
They are nice servants.

Police suspects: Two acts of terrorism were planned in Australia, led by the head of Isis
The head of the extremist organisation Isis leading a group of Australian men who are suspected of taking the bomb on a plane from Etihd Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a leading figure in Isis also sending building blocks to Sydney.
There were suspicions that the bomb was to be taken to an aircraft on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police do not specify why the company was interrupted.
Another of the suspected terrorists' plans was to build a device for transporting toxic, colourless gas and to transport it to a public place of overcrowding, such as a public transport vehicle.
Michael Phelan, Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Because of suspected terrorist plans, four men were detained in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will also continue.
The pros of Trump?
Make Mitt Romney look like the ancestor of common sense
During the Trump era, it has been repeated ad nauseam that families have also been torn apart by the intense divisions between the electorate on a daily basis.
Around Christmas and celebrations, the advice boards of the American newspapers provided guidance on how to deal with the relatives of Trump's voters.
We all want to have our information bubble burst.
Less attention has been paid to Trump 's ability to unite families.
I say this because my cousin visited me in New York this week, a left-wing poet in Chicago, who has long been up against the Republicans in our family.
He recalled that a common enemy can have a strong unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousin is all familiar with - also the Republican-profitable sister with whom he has been arguing politics for decades - suddenly and suddenly on the same side.
It is a good thing at the dinner table, but in the broader sense it involves significant risks.
Trump has given fresh impetus to the left, but the perverse effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and 'normalization', we are talking about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to withstand the horror of his tricks.
In the long term, it is an even more appalling prospect that Trump normalises the right far-off Republicans, who suddenly appear to be quite reasonable compared to Trump.
I recall with sadness the restrained version of Mitt Romney of madness: A dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (and his tax returns have at least been seen), and compared with Trump they seem to be very minor infringements.
Once the Trump period is over, the next Republican presidential candidate will only have to be clear-headed, and that immediately seems to be a considerable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the carousel of the Centre Park, which is the biggest carousel in New York City and the best you get in New York on $3 without caffeine.
The horses of the carousel are huge, the characters in the middle - grotesque clowns and animals looking back in terror - are ominous, and the music behind them is strangely fascinating.
Many of the characteristics of New York are becoming disappointing over time: The prospects of high buildings are beginning to get tired, the city's silhouette is too familiar and the reality of the city is not equal to dreams.
After 35 years, I still have not managed to overcome the fact that Swiss Cotttage is not a Swiss cottage, but a large traffic circle in northern London.
The carousel of the centre, however, is still a strange magic experience - to the extent that two women, two years old, one eleven years old and two women around the Quartet, enjoy it enormously.
I would have given my carousel a full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately no one asked me.
Instead, I was asked this week at the department store to assess the scale of my "payment experience" from one to five stars before I put my credit card on the readers.
It's the same in my café at home, but there I'm also given the opportunity to combine a 15% service in the assessment when I go to the coffee counter for myself.
This slows down daily interaction and puts pressure on the customer servant to put his or her person in a situation where it is not needed.
The trader of the department smiled at the sorry state of affairs when I gave my credit card five stars to experience it in use.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Interl - "There was no leadership confidence"
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuq's team's representative team from the position of coach.
The responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Picareta, formerly an assistant coach.
The other team will continue its current activities.
Picareta, an Italian, has been an assistant coach in the past, for example, in Sunderland in England.
The 51-year-old Piccolata, who joined the Inter Training Group in January, has issued a UEFA Pro licence last year.
Stefan Håkan, Chairman of FC Intergovernment, was saddened by this incident.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
But Shefki Kuqi no longer had the confidence of the club's management, when there was no other option now, Håkan commented in the Society's communiqué.
The Piccolates Agreement will remain in force until the end of the period.
Together with the other team of coaching staff, he will be responsible for tomorrow's home match against HIFK.
According to information from the evening-Sanomat, the team has been going through Thursday.
On Thursday morning, Mr Kuqi told the players that the deputy coaches of the club, Mr Picareta and Mr Allen, have been removed.
Mr Kuqi and Mr Picareta were very much in contact at the Interi match last Saturday with the PS Kem.
Linda Lampenius published a youth picture of the 80s - would you recognise a serious violin student?
Linda Lampenius, the young boy in Instagram, published a youth photo.
A number of blueberry has been added to the photo, which suggests that the musician is a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Mr Lampenius himself is seriously amazed at the young woman watching the camera.
Long ago, serious, he posts.
If the photo is not shown, you can look at it here.
In the past, Lampenius has published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
More than a year ago, on Instagram, he published a picture pair of himself.
In one picture he is seen 20 years ago, in the other he is posing now, as the mother of two children.
In his metaphor, Mr Lampenius ponders his own growth as a human being and refers to the eating disorders which he suffered when he was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learned to like myself and how I look, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added in English hashtags life, eating disorder, uncertainty, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating cages in previous years.
He was already 14 years old in hospital because of anorexia and orthoroutes.
A little later he also became ill with bulimia, which was only discovered in 2006.
The recovery started slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer review, Lampenium helped a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital care for civilians on his wrist, which, according to the prison authorities, he received after falling into prison cell.
Pistorius was convicted of the murder, after the accused had chosen the original death sentence.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, he killed several shots through the toilet door at home in Pretoria.
Pisstorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night invader hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have told us that they intend to appeal again, because they consider the sentence of the six years of Pistilus to be too light.
The Prosecutor-General will appeal to the Supreme Court in South Africa and the appeal will possibly be dealt with as early as this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the sentence for Pistorium may be extended to 15 years.
South Africa does not have the death penalty.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians who were illegally camped were arrested in Greece, according to the State Department's bTV channel.
On the morning of 1 August, a number of people were arrested by the police in a number of unauthorised camps, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the case continues.
According to the television channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that it had freed the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules for free campsites and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone camping in areas other than those reserved for this purpose.
Inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry declared that the court may impose a fine.
Liquid stock is sinking - already sunk -7,7%
The oil processor Neste's share has dropped by 7.7 percent at around 11 a.m.
The result before taxes fell, but exceeded the forecast compiled by the Inquiry Financial.
Stock exchange trading has started today at a slightly thick half in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the opening of the stock exchanges, the large European Stoxx 600 index had fallen by 0.2%.
The general index for the Helsinki Stock Exchange OMXH had fallen by 0.3% after half an hour's trading to 9509.48 points, and OMXH25 for the most traded companies had fallen by 0.3%.
The total exchange on the stock exchange was EUR 41 million, of which nine million was a printed liquid in the morning.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may alleviate the irritable salt syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare in the digestion system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: A diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may facilitate irritable salt syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease affecting about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in the United Kingdom. It causes stomach lobes, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the necessary amino acid tryptophan helps the body to develop the immune cells that strengthen the resilience of the intestine.
According to the research leader, Marco Colonnan, the immune cells guard against salt and ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, the result may be irritable bowel syndrome.
The tests found that the immune cells that strengthen the resistance are mice, which contains a certain bacteria in the intestine.
This bacteria needs an tryptophan in order to start to appear immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the building materials for proteins.
"We found a connection between Lactobacillus reuterus and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuterus is part of the normal microbiology of the intestine," Professor COLONNA says.
"The more mice's diet contained tryptophan, the more they had such immune cells."
If the same thing works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus Reuter bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan may strengthen the resilience of the intestine and reduce inflammation.
Upon examining the immune-reinforcing immune cells, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan discovered that, although one group of mice had such cells, they were not in the same mouse-species that were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference related to the microbial presence of mice, that is, to the normal body of the digestive system of bacteria, fungi, and viruses.
When DNA from the intestine of mice was examined, six bacteria were found in the mouse that had immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus rheumatoid bacteria were given to mouse that grew up in a sterile environment and did not have an intestinal microbiology for which no immune cells were developed, they began to develop immune cells.
The researchers wanted to find out how the bacteria affected the immune system; they grew Lactobacillus rheumatoid bacteria in the fluid and transferred small quantities of fluids - without bacteria - from the mouse to the isolated immature immune cells.
The electrostatic properties developed into cells that strengthen the resistance.
When the active ingredient was cleaned of the fluid, it proved to be a by-product of the metabolic process of tryptophan, known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the nutrition of the mice, the number of cells confirming the tolerance rose by about 50%. When the number of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells fell to half the previous level.
Cervantes-Barragan says that people have the same cells that strengthen their resilience as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus Reuters in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether by-products from Lactobacillus reuterus may develop in the same way in humans as with mice.
"We certainly want to promote the development of such cells as they control inflammation in the inner surfaces of the intestines," said Cervantes-Barragan.
"A high level of tryptophanes combined with Lactobacillus reuter may contribute to its spread."
For Jose Mournho, Manchester United was awarded a "genius" after entering into an agreement with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mournho believes that Manchester United won a "genius" in his ranks after entering into an agreement with Nemanja Matic. A midfield player debuted Manchester United in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
A total of £40 million passed from Chelsea to Matic began a 2-1 victory in Dublin, at the last pre-United match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday, as a defensive middle player against stars such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
Matic, however, was not in the best condition as he was not involved in a blue-shirt Asian tour before the season began. He lived on the ground for only 45 minutes - according to Mourinho, must change before the Premier League season starts.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and mindset make him a genius - he has the natural ability to think in football," says Mournho.
"We help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
Not only Matic, but also the newcomers Victor Lindelf and Romeli Lukaku were starting the game at the Aviva stadium when Mourinho began to wave his initial team for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a "great job" by acquiring three of his four top players.
"Three out of four - thank you," he added.
"I'm happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Germany was bullied by air balloons over two instalments
Finland's women's volleyball team lost its fourth World Cup tournament for Germany directly in EMI 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany has a high level of routine playing.
The game was smooth in every sector, with Tapio Kangasniemi as the head coach in Finland reporting.
In the first two steps, Finland kept its opponents on the brink, but in the third period, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and in certain places with enough aggression, it was possible to boil with it, "Kangasniemi said.
The most powerful country in Finland was Piia Korhonen.
Three of the four lost Finland matches Slovenia still meets on Sunday.
Reuters: Great jury has already sent challenges in connection with the meeting of Trump Jr with Russia.
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The great jury, convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, has already sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer known for the Kremlin relations with Natalia Vesselnitskaya.
This is reported by Reuters, which at the same time confirms the information that the Wall Street Journal had previously revealed on Thursday about the convening of a large jury.
According to Reuters, challenges have been posed by a large jury following a meeting between Trump Jr and the Veselnitskaya, known as the Kremlin links, which took place during the US presidential elections in June 2016.
Donald Trump Sr was also present, then Head of Campaign Paul Manaft as well as his son, the current adviser to the White House, Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a large jury in Washington means that the pace of the Russian investigation will be increased.
The sources add that Mr Mueller wanted an investigation to assist the great jury to investigate Russia's interference in the US presidential elections and whether the Trump campaign or his entourage cooperated with Russia.
The Grand jury will extend the rights of Mueller to collect evidence, to send challenges and to force people to testify on a legal basis.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
A large jury will assess the evidence investigated by the prosecutor in the investigation and decide whether charges should be brought.
A British microchip invented to get into his home and his car with a hand wave
The British inventor was the first in the whole country to chip himself so that he can open the door to his home, get into his office and start his car with a wave of the hand.
The microchip is between Steven Northampi's thumb, who is 33 years old, and the front load.
Northam works with Geoff Watson, the consultant puppy doctor consulting the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester in Khanty, to ensure that the installation of the microchip meets the medical requirements.
The technique used in Microiris is the same as in microchips and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds to install it.
Northham company will also make the blocks of houses and cars compatible with the microchip.
Northham is married and has one child. He has installed microchip technology in both his home and BMW Z4, which starts when he puts his hands on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's decision last month to fly a naval helicopter to the southern lawn of the White House, for an event presenting American production, cost the taxpayer USD 24 000.
The Green White White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the President is on its way. It was an attraction in the White House at the event on 17 July 2017, which presented American building programmes.
Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a number of White House officials looked at the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, samples included, inter alia, a sailor from Maine, a fire vehicle from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi.
The White House's military office had requested a helicopter to be located only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn in an "exceptional" event, as is evident from the documents of the Navy HMX-1 helicopter fleet.
"I just wanted to make sure that you are aware of this, because this is an exceptional event that will get a lot of visibility," the commander of HMX-1 wrote on the day before the event in an email to his superior, who is an assistant captain of a naval flight.
The message was that the helicopter would arrive on the southern lawn at 7 a.m. in the morning and the event would start at 3 a.m. in the afternoon.
In addition, it was mentioned in the message that if the helicopter's departure from the White House were to be delayed, another crew would be needed because of the constraints of service times.
The original crew was in a helicopter for the time of the incident, and the unit's security staff were at the helicopter while it was in the ground.
The documents received by the magazine are not clear whether another crew was eventually needed.
The US Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked if the incident was in breach of the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act. We were told it would not be broken," the commander wrote.
"It sounds as if you can participate," said the assistant commander.
Made in America was an official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President spoke out in favour of health care reform in the Senate and less stringent state regulation.
The political use of the Marine One helicopter and the Air Force One aircraft is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them on their journeys,
But their use for photographs is unusual.
In February, Mr Trump's actions drew attention to the fact that Air Force One rolled over in the light of the presidential campaign event in Melbourne in the State of Florida.
"The White House is very satisfied with the" Made in America "event, which presented products from American materials from all 50 states," said Lindsay, Press Officer of the White House.
The HMX-1 crews regularly operate training flights in Washington area and practice in the southern lawn by bringing the President to the White House with the precision of centimetres.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 training sessions for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
The unit's helicopters also flown 11 hours on that day in "non-presidential supporting duties."
According to the White House, there was no cost to taxpayers.
The spokesman of Sikorsky told us that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter display on the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 has no records of flights related to the presidential duties and it is difficult to estimate the exact cost of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence's hourly compensation for the VH-3D helicopter, the compensation level is USD 24 380 per hour.
According to HMX-1 documents, flights from Quantco to the White House from Virginia and back lasted for an hour in total.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are clearly lower.
"It is misleading to calculate the cost to the taxpayer by way of compensation," says Mr Walter.
"The estimated level of reimbursement includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called" submerged costs "that are taken into account in annual allocations."
According to a report by RAND in 2015, the compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the incident, the former press secretary of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and thus probably employing hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of a helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans have worked so hard on.
It is entirely appropriate to say so. "
It is not certain whether or not Trump visited a helicopter during the event, but at least he put a fire-engine in the driver's place.
In the White House, Trump joked the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said. "I have three."

Venezuelan state prosecutor asks for the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative office in Venezuela
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor has applied for a Court ruling which would prevent the appointment of a new representative office in Venezuela.
The President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that a delegation elected last Sunday is due to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a representative was elected to the country, which could, among other things, amend the country's constitution.
According to the Chief Prosecutor, Luisa Ortega, a decision to block has been requested because of concerns about electoral fraud.
Ortega has also opened an inquiry into electoral fraud.
He appointed two judges after the British company that organised a vote in the Council declared that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters notified by the Venezuelan authorities was approximately one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only the allies of Maduro were nominated, and the newly elected 545 members include the son and wife of Maduro.
In addition to amending the constitution, the assembly can dissolve the opposition-led congress and amend laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
The Maduro actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition regards the modification of the constitution as a means of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called it a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have said that they do not recognise the new representative.
Maduro claims that the new assembly is the solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, the unrest has been going on for months.
Many people have been wounded and over 100 have died.
Venezuela was plunged into an economic crisis when oil prices fell.
Today, many people cannot afford food or medicines.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate its opinion on Friday when the new assembly is due to be set up.
A Russian man extradited by Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, in the United States, the Minnephew court sentenced maxim Senahi, aged 41, to almost four years' imprisonment for involvement in global computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a request from the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
In February 2016, Finland handed over Senahi to the US judicial authorities despite Russian protests, "says AFP.
In March this year he was found guilty of computer fraud, which had profited millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the US Department of Justice, Senah is expelled from the country following the execution of a prison sentence.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly reproached Finland following his arrest and said that he should not be extradited to the United States.
The opinion reproached Finland and the United States for having carried out the arrest in Finland without the prior knowledge of the matter by Russia.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used the Ebury computer virus, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus used to catch user names and passwords.
The fraudsters then used the data to further control internet traffic, which used to click scams and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, Director of the Criminal Directorate of the Ministry of Justice, the case shows that the United States is also able to pursue cyber-criminals operating elsewhere.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, "Blanco said in the release.

Kari Kola takes an exceptional work of light in Paris
Kari Kola, a Joenswind artist in Joensuu, is carrying out an exceptional work of light in order to celebrate the first Light Day set by the UN on 16 May next year in Paris.
Kola makes a work of light art in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work will shed light on the Fontenay building, which is the headquarters of UNESCO, and on the Globe Monument that represents it.
In my work, I would like to highlight not only light but also darkness.
Today, light pollution for millions of cities is a major problem affecting the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can give concrete expression to what I think is important, "says Kari Kola, the photoartist.
I am well taken from the invitation to be involved in the first International Light Day and to bring the art of light into the thematic day, "Kola continues.
Kari Kola was present at the opening of the Year of Valo in 2015, when she shed the headquarters of UNESCO to mark the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to be able to restore my art to the headquarters of UNESCO, "Kari Kola says.
The work may still expand significantly.
We will report on this later in the autumn, "Kola continues.

UN says democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
The elections will only be representative if all members of society, including women, can vote on them, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the interim head of the UN mission, said that hundreds of women were nominated for the elections to the provincial councils, three women were appointed as vice-president and more than 30% of newly registered voters were women.
"The role of women cannot be over-emphasised," Mr Hayshom said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all aspects of the electoral process.
The Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban have been threatening elections at a time when international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's elections are the first time that power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Hayshom said that women's contribution will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

A flood of certain tourists threatens the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The local rage is directed in particular at the form of tourism represented by the cruise ship.
The Italian Minister for Culture calls it a 'eat and flee' tourism: The destination is only a few hours and a large number of attractions are crammed through.
Venice is a busy day trip to the city for tourists.
It is difficult to move around on narrow streets and the great squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer be counted.
They have been forced to move further away from the historic centre while hotels have taken over.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
The authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When arriving at a large cruise ship, time is given for two or three hours.
You are following a flag-bearing guide to Piazzale Roma Rialto Bridge and the St Mark Market Market Market Market Market Market Market Market Market Market and, back, the Italian Minister for Culture, Dario Franceschini, describes the prevailing and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of places, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this aspect of urban identity.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice's historic centre.
The church of St. Mark is located on the outskirts.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
In the historic centre of Venice, only 50 000 local residents are living.
In 1951 the population was about 175,000.
In July, approximately 2 000 Russians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroyed the environment and driven the inhabitants away.
Approximately 2 000 inhabitants leave every year.
If this continues, after a few years there will be no tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belfram, who was in the vanguard of the demonstration.
It is a difficult equation, because the vessels are bringing in Venice the income it so badly needs and creating a need for a large number of jobs in various sectors.
Apart from limiting the amount of tourism, the solution is that the cruise ship should move away from the historical centre.
According to Luciano Borot, who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the Veneto region, where Venice is also located, were given more power to decide on its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Approximately 20-30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
Congestion of huge kilometres on the motorway
The motorway between Kuopio and Silinjärvi in the north has had kilometres of congestion during the return journey on a Thursday afternoon from work.

Even in the 50-km border area, however, the traffic had moved on to places of walking distance on Thursday afternoon.
The certain works moved on the side of the Lake of Illinois on Thursday afternoon.
I can do well without such attention
The 23-year-old runner has had to see the curses of the public.
Amalie Iuel has published wonderful images of his own, among others, in the Grand Canyon landscape.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish Norwegian, has grown up as a popular athlete in his current home country, Norway, not least because in March he broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record of 400 metres by travelling round 51.81.
A month later he improved the 400-metre fence at the Norwegian record time of 55.38.
Iuel, a keen social media user, soon after his record, realised that fame and publicity had their drawbacks.
Men from all over the world began to send pictures of their sexual organs to Iuel, apparently in the hope that the young runner would take an interest in them.
Iuel was forced to close off his Snapchat account.
I got a lot of "rude" from unknown people, so I had to turn my account into a private one, "Iuel told the VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of images he received.
You can guess, Iuel laughed.
It is nice to receive feedback after the race, but I can do well without such other attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
Her mother is Danish, the father of a Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway under the age of 2.
A twelve-year-old family, when Amalie was twelve years old, moved first to Namibia, then to Pakistan, because of her father's work.
Then came Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete in Los Angeles, the University of Southern California, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains through the guidance of three coaches, Leif Olav Alness, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Sleldum.
Norway is much more open to discussions than the United States.
In the United States, the coaches do not ask for anything, but only lay down rules.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal with the athlete personally, "said Iuel to VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records in 400 metres and 400 metres in a fence race.
A foot injury brought a snowman to the ears of Janne throughout his career - now in the World Cup: "Nice when you don't hurt anything"
Now it's been nice to count when you haven't happened anything!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of the most successful snowmen in Finland, has again been able to really enjoy her beloved species this season.
Even last summer, the continuation of a career was at stake.
The heavier burden on the table had forced the ear to the operating table in January, and the leg did not want to heal at all.
She had taken the hits in the cat.
In the summer I didn't know at all what I was doing, whether the ferry will continue or not.
The Sponsorids were broken and many things open, "says Korpi.
But it is said that things tend to be sorted out.
The leg improved, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and the blood started to pull back to the chest.
The decision to continue was then easy.
I knew this at the latest when I visited the EEA once in snow.
I was that hemmetti, yes this again is so fun, will be pulled a couple more ways.
It was not until September / October that Korpi was able to count properly, but after a long time of reckoning, just painless exercise has been a big deal.
Only a few people have been around the games.
It does not matter.
The competitions have never been Corvelle's most important aspect of the ferry.
I have never fallen because of one race.
I think it's frustrating to target four years for one race and then you're in the heat of the week.
I can't think like that, "says Korpi.
Today, Korpi is hosting the halfpipes of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though individual games do not like him on a ferry, he will always be lit in a tough club.
According to the basket, the reputation of the games organised by the International Ski Association has increased over recent years, although some of the ferry operators chose the Norwegian X-Games, which is being held at the same time.
Yes, these are important games, visibility is big.
However, in my opinion, respect always depends on the conditions and the level of the Games.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in Finland's 12-person team in Sierra Nevada.
The bumps on the team, the 17-year-old Rene Rinnekanas and Emmi Parkkiseniemi, are 14 years younger than the jewel.
It's nice to follow the younger guys.
I remember when I myself was at that point that everything was new and was so sick with enthusiasm for everything.
It will bring a new stream to yourself, "says Korpi.
I still have some catching up to do, but otherwise I will not, that much is flowing in the guys!
The background to Janne Korpi's career is a different sports career.
The son of a guide-line Pekka basket is hooked up to a nutritious sport: The ferry has its own horses for which he makes training programs.
When I'm on my way all the time, there's no time to be in the fair.
But I look every day at least for the nutrient results and usually something of a departure, "says Korpi.
Treatment and nutrition training are a potential career plan according to the ears when the ferry career is completed in time.
I do not want to go that far, but it is at least a probable alternative.
I experience it as if I were studying it in addition to snowboarding.
I try to stay on the nerves and develop, in the summer run maybe something of a departure.
If it is a mon's future occupation, then it's not difficult to start when you already have ready in the species.
The event also includes the Elitloppet cruise which is being organised with the presenter Jajo Linnonmaa.
The twin has chartered a cruise ship, which will head to Stockholm in late May for the Elitloppet competition.
Al-Korpi and Linnomaa decided to revive the old tradition.
Cruises have gone well for business and people have been excited.
We are already at a point where there will at least be no bankruptcy.
A few months on, let's hope that the ship will be filled, "says Korpi enthusiastically.
The Attendo care project for Kitee is all of a surprise
Attendo Ester is the name of the new care home of 41-based elderly people being built in Kitu.
The building of more than 1 700 m2 is expected to be completed next summer on the other side of the health route of the health centre.
The general question about Kii is where to find customers for the new management unit, because now, during Siun's wars, many private care homes are kicking in customer shortages.
The regional director of care services, Anne Flink Attendo, commented that in the future, Kit will increase demand not only for alternatives but also for more efficient service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, the freedom of choice works better too, "says Flink.
Last year, Attido bought private care homes in Kanervikkola and Eerika from Kitta.
The deal concerned business, but the real estate is reportedly a five-year lease.
Flink says there is no acute need to move operations away from these premises.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVisitie's brand in Scotland
The trade union is seeking confirmation from the directors of McDonnee's inventor of long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to Scotland, the General Confederation of British Trade Unions, the company has not reported on its plans for the future of the Toll cross plant.
The factory manufacturing Hobnbos and Rich Tea has more than 500 employees.
The Pladis company owned by the McDonnee's brand said it invested more than GBP 5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives were "surely the first to be informed" in the event of changes in activity.
In a letter to the Director, GMB "calls on the company to" respond to concerns about the lack of funding for the modernisation of production lines. "
The GMB trade union Drew Duff finds it extremely worrying that the factory manager does not have clear information about the needs of the Toll cross business and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and in the metropolitan area of Glasgow. The factory is a major employer in the area of high unemployment and low income.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, and Brexit, rising living costs and a constant reduction in production, Glasgow in the East is in dire need of successful McVitie's production. "
According to the spokesman of Pladisi, the head of the factory had received a trade union letter only the day before and the company is responding directly to the letter because it appreciates the continuous interaction with the workers and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with workers and representatives of the GMB in Toll cross two months ago, when we discussed a number of issues openly.
Among other things, we discussed with workers the fact that, like other companies operating in highly competitive and insecure markets, we are constantly assessing all our operations and offices in order to remain competitive. "
According to the spokesman, the company has invested over £5 million in the Toll cross plant in recent years, especially in its production lines and in improving its operations.
"We are aware of the long history of Toll cross as a production facility and we will certainly be the first to inform employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the operation of the plant."
Did PSG Barcelonaa Neyman transfer guarantee three years ago?
LaLiga may regret its interest in Marco benchmarks
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up the Neyman pursuit after having paid GBP 189 million a transfer sum, but did you warn PSG Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The previous record was less than half that: It was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United at a cost of GBP 89 million.
After the move, Neyman becomes the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's best-paid professional athlete, because PSG provides him with a weekly salary of over £500 000 after tax.
Barcelona is known to be furious about PSG's activities and the way Neyman has left the club. A source close to Barcelona tells us that Neyman has taken great care of the club since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the President of the PSG ensure the football world from this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned the best players in PSG clubs.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they're looking for our players, we'll become their opponents and we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they seek out our players, they will face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of this: It expressed its interest in the PSG central field player Marco was compared earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neyman.

Now: The telephone calls inspired by Trump were invented - a spokesman for the White House: 'I would not say it was a lie'.
The White House recognises that two calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, "says the New York Times.
The telephone calls from Trump, both with the President of Mexico and with the head of the scouts organisation, have proved to be invented.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokesman, confirmed that no calls had been made.
However, he said that Trump did not lie.
According to Mrs Sanders, many of the leading figures of the scouts spoke personally to Trump, and the President of Mexico, Enrique PENNA Nieton, had spoken to Trump at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I would not say it was a lie, it is a pretty harsh accusation.
Those discussions took place, not just on the phone but on the face, Mrs Sanders explained.
The Speech to the Scout
On Monday, Mr Trump told him that the President of Mexico called him and praised Mr Trump for his success in eradicating illegal immigration.
According to Trump, PENA Nieto told us that few will cross the southern border of Mexico any more, because they know that the trip will in any case work on the border with the United States.
On Wednesday, the Mexican Government issued a note in which it said that this telephone call had not taken place.
On Tuesday, politico published a full version of the interview with Trump in The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump spoke at a major meeting of the national scout organisation in West Virginia.
I got a call from the leader of the scouts, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told.
On Wednesday, the scout organisation reported that it was not aware of any of its leaders' calls to Trump.
According to the press release, the previous statement by Michael Surbaugh, the head of the organisation, in which he had apologised for Trump's speech from the scouts, speaks for himself.
The speech made by Trump at the meeting of the scout organisation attracted a great deal of surprise, as it was exceptionally political in nature.
He, among other things, blew up the results of last autumn's presidential elections.
