Camille Auer wanted to fix her sex, was diagnosed as a mental illness, and now she is doing art on the subject - "A man should have a right to his own body"
There are dozens of patient reports on the roof of the Project room gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts.
Each of them reads the name of Camille Auer.
The papers tell a long-running story about how outsiders have written their interpretation of Auer and her identity.
Determined for him who he is.
"I wanted to share my personal history of treatment to make the violence of the process visible," says Auer.
In the process he refers to the process of sexual slavery.
It is often a research cycle lasting many years with meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process will start with the diagnostic tests on gender identity disorders carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this he had used estrogen ordered over the Internet and was already well advanced in his own repair process.
She felt that she was a woman, but under Finnish law, a person has to undergo a process of repair so that the sex can also be restored legally.
The Transitional Law, the Law on the Strengthening of the Transsex Sex (563/2002), obliges transgender people to undergo forced sterilisation, so that the right sex can be obtained, for example, in the Population Register Centre and in the passport.
At present, there is a requirement for a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of reproductive impairment for every sex to be corrected.
It is the right of man to decide on his own body.
"This situation is intolerable and a violation of human rights," says Auer.
The reform of Trans-Law has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight comments on the law and there is a preliminary ruling before the European Court of Human Rights which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish Government prepared an amendment to the law under the then Minister for Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huovise.
Elections came and the Basic Finns got into government.
Now the change of law is blocked again.
These are internal political disputes which do not even relate to this particular law.
"The government does not want to put it on the table because there are differences within the government about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty's Finland Department.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One consists of packaging and user instructions for medicines used by Auer.
At the Patient Reporting Office, for example, any visitor can read the psychology of the transpl at the University Hospital in Tampere from Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and, on the basis of these, wrote a report which would define Auer's right to treatment as well as to receive help.
The perception of the reality being investigated appears to be susceptible to instability.
The viewpoint of self-being in a borderline way appears fragmented and the unstable characteristics of personality are accentuated.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as a mental illness," says Auer.
An even greater shock was the fact that Auer was not given sex slavery treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to begin the process.
He was denied his own identity.
Then, on 11 February 2015 - Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transplant waiting sauna around the TV.
Later on, a work of art was created on that television called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflected on her experience of power and its use.
"It is crazy that any person who is defined as a woman at birth can magnify their breasts, but you need a diagnosis for breast removal," says Auer.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are other than the number of sex determined at birth.
The Auer experience is unfortunately not the only one of its kind.
The gender adjustment process is more painful for many people for psychological reasons than for purely medical operations.
It meets dozens of people who need to be justified on their own existence and their right to their own sex experience.
"It's crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment on the pretext that their resources are not enough," says Auer.
Many people who have applied for the process have an underlying psychological symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
On these grounds, medical staff may order that treatment cannot be begun.
"Preventing treatment and help can put a person in an even worse situation than it was before the process started," says Auer.
The personal exhibition in Auer also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: "I have had self-destructive thoughts throughout my adult life and that is something that people usually find it hard to digest."
Depression has been treated with medicines and when Auer started using hormones, it made it easier to feel.
He was finally able to say the feelings that had existed since childhood and teenage years.
The reason why the wide jaw did not seem to fit into your body and why breast muscles had to be round rather than flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people close to Him who see Him.
There is a basic need to see one.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using voice and moving," he says.
Today, Auer already feels like he is seen, he exists as a woman.
At the beginning of the process, however, the fortuitous comments of those close to us could have been very hurtful.
It hurts most when close to the wrong spots.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they refuse or are unable to internalise it," he continues.
However, not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from bodybuilder or body quarrels, where the body or its parts can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and without a long process of research, there can be no official confirmation of the sex.
"There is no medical justification for these studies," says Auer.
And that is true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for legal recognition of the gender.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination with regard to the legal sex.
An adult applicant submits a written application for a new identity card telling him that he or she feels like a different sex.
After a six-month period of reflection, the applicant will confirm his application in writing and the Ministry will issue a new personal identification number to the applicant.
This right to self-determination is also required in Finland, and the exhibition in Auer sums up this demand.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist, but an exhibition is a political and artistic work experiment.
I want to believe that art still carries weight and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.

The NGOs issued a travel warning to Missouri
The national organisation NAACP for the civil rights of Afro-seafarers has issued a travel warning to Missouri about the discriminatory practices of the state and the racist attacks that have taken place there.
"The NAACP mission information for Missouri enters into force on 28 August 2017 and calls on Afro-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when travelling to a state where there have recently been a number of questionable racial events."
A recent law in Missour makes it difficult to bring cases of discrimination before a court. In addition, the implementation of the state's laws is disproportionately aimed at minorities. According to NAACP, these circumstances led to the provision of a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are stopped on the basis of colour, beaten or killed" Rod Chapel, President of NAACP Missouri, said to Kansas City Star.
"We haven't heard so many cases before in such a short time."
The mission information for Missouri is the first US state warning.
The organisation cited as examples the racist comments made against African students at the University of Missour and the death of the 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year. He was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel. He was arrested by the Missouri police even though he was not charged with the crime.
The travel press also referred to a report by the Minister of Justice in Missouri, which stated that the police are 75% more likely to stop a black driver than a white one.
"The purpose of the travel brochure is to encourage people to be vigilant and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missour," says Chapel.
"People have to prepare, for example, by taking money to pay guarantees or telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, in 2015, one hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri, the sixteenth largest among the states in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to take companies to court for discrimination in housing and employment.
Recently, the civil rights organisation ACLU, which defends constitutional rights, issued travel alerts to Texas and Arizona after they had approved immigration laws obliging the police to arrest people for immigration offences, which, according to the organisation, will increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concern other countries, but recently they have been published by NGOs in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä requested clarification from Finnair on the President's supplementary pension
The Finnish Minister of Industry responsible for corporate governance, Mika Lintilä (Center.) has requested clarification from Finnair on the supplementary pension fee received by the CEO of the airline Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
According to the Minister, this contradicts the expression of the will of the state.
The additional pension of EUR 130 000 received by Vantaa came up this week when Helsinki Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of the directors of listed companies.
The Finnish Image Journal reported on the supplementary pension of Vauramo in February.
Finnair said it would abandon supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has taken the line that supplementary pensions are not used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's decision in principle on corporate governance.
Immediate toughening of sanctions
Until recently, it looked as if relations between the United States and Russia were going from the cold to the warm.
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting in Hamburg on the occasion of the G20 industrialisation meeting, seemed to be doing well together.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions adopted by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were met with bitter reactions in Russia.
The most disappointing response so far has been to hear from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev that the sanctions law signed by Trump amounts to a 'full-scale trade war'.
Even if Russian reactions were only to be counted among the excesses and excesses of political rhetoric, the tension between the United States and Russia is a fact of life after the month of honey following the election of Trump.
In the United States, it was not easy to get through the sanctions regime for Russia, Iran and North Korea.
The law was, admittedly, passed by Congress with considerable unanimity, but the President was reportedly faced with far more difficulties in passing it.
Indeed, Mr Trump criticised the recent law he had signed as 'significant shortcomings'.
The reason for President Trump's needs may have been Russia in particular, although the adoption of a law restricting one's own prerogatives must also have been repugnant.
As is well known, an investigation is under way in the United States of America into possible Russian interference in the presidential elections, as well as into the links between the Trump campaign and Russia.
The blackmail between the United States and Russia is a reality after a short month of itching.
As the White House staff have been replaced with a constant stream of scandals, and various outrageous turns have been revealed, it is becoming increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States under the presidency of the President, but in spite of the President.
This is certainly not a desirable situation.
If the relationship with Russia is a buzz in the United States, the same is true of the European Union.
Not only economic sanctions, but also the tense security situation in the Union's core region of the Baltic Sea is exacerbating relations.
The EU has given a high profile to the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy on Russia, at least on the face of it, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State with a lot of trade, such as Finland, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The effects of the recent US sanctions are still unclear.
There are fears in the EU that the sanctions will make it more difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, for example, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project and possibly the Feta power plant project may be affected.
The acidity in Europe has been caused by the fact that the sanctions have excluded, for example, the liquefied natural gas lng, which is important for the US economy.
Trade sanctions are a means in world politics of demonstrating disapproval.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought-out and rigorous.
Otherwise, they can easily do more harm than good.
Is nothing sacred any more?
Trump's White House now has a statue of freedom in its sights.
Interference in the statue is the surest sign of a change of power.
The Americans know this as well as others: the Iraqis, together with the American soldiers, destroyed the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologies of the Trump regime, was well aware of what he was doing in the heated debate with the CNN Canal Jim Acosta, which was attacked by Mr Miller in the vocabulary of the President's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller did not really criticise the statue itself.
Had he done so, he would have been assaulted by huge herds of cruise organizers and characters imitating the Statue of Liberty.
His attack was on the importance of the statue and, in particular, the fact that in 1903 the statue of the poem was added to the statue by Emma Lazarus - 17 years after the statue was completed.
This is how Miller radiated Acosta: "I don't want to go into the history of it now, but the statue of freedom is a symbol of the American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was added later, and it is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Mr Miller was not wrong in himself, but it is not just history, as he himself said.
Essentially, the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones of its kind in which the state not only invites immigrants but 'the poorest of the poor': 'Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse your teeming shore'.
The poem is more topical than ever.
He made it clear that the 'poorest of the poor' are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The dispute over the importance of the Statute is part of a wider political and cultural dispute over the importance of the United States.
The friends of Lazarus campaigned after his death for the plague to be laid on the foot of the statue, knowing full well that it was a deeply political act.
The object of the Patsa was to illustrate the links between French and American republicanism with a classic symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem the female character is no longer abstract but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of those expelled.
To associate food with the image was a brilliant feminist coup d'état and a devastating attack on American nationality.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to its original meaning.
Rush Limbaugh - a forward-runner who can now be seen as a kind of omen for Trump - claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not an invitation to anyone, but an early pioneer of neo-conservatives that takes the US torch to cover the darkness: "Lady Liberty stands out.
He is taking the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not show the way to the United States."
Rare enough, Limbaugh was partly right.
The significance of the statue of liberation depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it like the poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and testing journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people seeking protection and a better life.
Her statue of freedom is comforted by giving hope and welcoming.
And that is what Miller and Trump absolutely do not want.
Their torch does not show the way but stirs up the flames of hatred, their only source of strength.
World Sport Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots got into the British national team
Neil Black, the chief executive director of the UK Athletics Association, says that 16 Scots members of the national team taking part in the World Cup are 'significant confirmation'.
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Sport Championships starting in London on Friday.
According to Black, something special is happening in Scotland, from which British sport must learn.
"This is welcome and we will continue to explore it so long as we understand what it is about," says Black.
"I had discussions with representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute and they thought it was related to the Institute's activities.
The Scottish General Sports Federation believes that it is linked to the activities of the Society,
and the British General Sports Federation believes that their activities are behind it.
And the common treasurer thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it's quite amazing, whenever it comes from."
Many Scots athletes in London are competing seriously for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who is competing with Sir Mo Farah in a 5 000-metre race, while Eilidh Doyle was selected as the captain of the national team.
Eilidh is too modest.
His Captain's speech was incredibly fantastic," Black says.
"Athletes left the event proud of their achievements and highly motivated regardless of where they happen to live and practice.
In Eilidh's words there was a real feeling and passion for sport."
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medal for the Commonwealth Championship with a 400-metre fence, and these are his fifth World Cup. He thinks it is "incredible" that there are 16 Scots in the national team.
The previous record was seven years from 1983 to 2015.
The central runner Laura Muir has held five British and two European records in one year.
He will be competing in London for 1 500 metres and 5 000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1 500 metres in London, and it is also worth keeping an eye on him: a man has an excellent season with profits from the World Cup tours in Great Britain and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when Lee McConnell was the only Scots on the national team.
The captain of the national team says he is "immensely proud" to have so many Scots on board, some of whom are really competing for finals and medals.
"Access to the captain is a great honour in any case, but it is even more so because the members of the national team voted for the captain," says Doyle.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who got into the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes who compete for the prizes.
My Captain's speech?
I think it went pretty well.
I concentrated on how lucky we are when we have the home games.
It is important to enjoy the support of the domestic public and to be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere will be absurdly wonderful."
Preventing critics on Facebook: Do not stand for public office if you do not withstand criticism
Our father knew what poor publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon started to criticise him for any domestic policy, from his political principles.
The criticism certainly annoyed,
but he did not silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is abolished, we may be led dumb and silent like sheep to be slaughtered," Washington said in 1783.
That brings us to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their presenters.
Hogan was taken to court by the U.S. Civil Liberties Association earlier this week.
His staff considers the challenge unjustified, and the response was also dismissive on the web.
"What does it matter? This is just Facebook," many commentators say.
But it does matter,
especially in the Hogan case.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of a state ruled by democrats.
He has the second best estimate of his work among 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to hearing.
He has presided over the state steadily and adhered strictly to the principles.
He has also expertly used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his voters and published there a picture of a film in chemotherapy.
The Governor's page is a public and official forum, run by his staff with tax money.
According to Amelia Chasse, Hogan's spokesman, who defended the Governor's action in an interview with Washington Post, it was only a matter of moderating comments.
However, branding commentators as trollers, spammers or haters is too easy a solution.
Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their elected leaders. They were not trollers but, for example, teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors.
They told me that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and objective.
The Pastor quoted the Bible in his comments; he wanted to appeal to the Catholic faith of Hogan.
The lawyer, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland from Bowi, was not hostile, but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in his comments on the Washington Post news.
"Nor can I accept that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately regarded as a somewhat organised group and are ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The Governor's staff called the comments 'a concerted attack'. Someone else might call them the furtherance of what was regarded as important.
In the age of Facebook, communication is easy to manage by blocking a critic or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But it really is the same thing, now only in digital terms.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of chairing Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users prevented by President Trump have taken him to court.
The first major decision on this issue was taken last week in Virginia.
According to the Judge of the District Court of Alexandria, James C. Cacheris, the first increase in the US Constitution was violated by the Government of the Loudoun county when they blocked their voters on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Liberties Association went to Kentucky's Republican Governor Matt Bevin to discuss the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This should not be difficult.
In Washington's time, low-cost postal charges had a similar effect to those now available on the Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers hammered Washington.
Even then there were trolleys.
The titles Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote in the newspapers in which they blamed Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticising the Jay Agreement, the US-UK Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement, as shown by documents collected by the Papers of George Washington.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
There have been samples from about 50 locations, plus online notifications from a couple or three.
Most of them have come from South and Southwest Finland, but then also individual from Hapave and Seinäjoki, specialist Marja Isomursu Evira says.
The enemies have died of a parasite called trikomonosis.
It is caused by the primitive animal Trichomonas gallinae, a scientifically known animal.
It has been known in the past that it strikes doves, and from them especially the puzzle.
In the twenty-first century, however, it also began to be detected in the form of scallops.
In 2009, we got very steeped.
At that time, trikomonosis caused a major collapse in the Finnish green fish stock, after which the species's stocks have been recovering.
There have been sick green cabinets, but not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, Mayor of the Natural Scientific Centre Museum of the University of Helsinki.
It is to be feared that the previous epidemic of green bins will recur again if something is not done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple matter that can be done by everyone: stop the summer feeding of birds immediately.
I'll be back with more on that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from its home base at the Renaissance Club
The former top European player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from his home field for the next three days, while the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th Senior Open tournament in Scotland.
Last year, Rafferty, an Irishman, led a tournament on the neighbouring Archerfield Links Airport before the last round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. He is very fond of the new place and is an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of the founder and CEO of the club, Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club and with this event it will be fully glorified," says Rafferty.
"Players see the field at its best. It is in a great condition.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He is a keen ambassador of the game and he is proud of his accomplishments here.
Tournament is a fantastic demonstration event for this field."
The English Eales will defend the championship for the first time, even though they have won both the European tour and the European branch in their 32-year career.
"This seems a very special opportunity," says the player in Southport.
"I was unable to defend my victory for Extremadura Open because the tournament is not included in the tour this year.
This is a great place to return.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories return to mind: the tournament victory was a wonderful thing for me and my wife, Mr Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember."
Gary Orr returns to real action on his own soil. He joined the tour after completing 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Scottish Management Open.
"In the region, gambling is always more important than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel an extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and played pretty heavily.
I am happy with my game so far."
The trio will be followed by Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty, the former Masters Winner Ian Woosnam and the senior managers.
Six Scots will take part: Orr and Sam Torrance, former Ryder Cup captain, and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The car park costs £5 if there is only a driver in the car and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All the proceeds will be donated to the Prostate Cancer UK.
The barracks investigated the possible indoor air problems of the barracks
In Säkyla, air problems have not been found, at least for the time being, in the barracks of a conveyor of the Pori Brigade, which was reported on Thursday.
Internal investigations are still continuing.
The investigation started when a man who interrupted his military service for health reasons thought his health had been impaired by a barracks of poor indoor air.
According to Pori Brigade Chief of Staff, Colostitnantti Mika Holma, no problems have been observed in the health situation of other military personnel.
It turned out that this was an isolated case and that the other servants of the unit had no health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to get to the bottom of this matter.
At the moment it is not known that we have any indoor air problem," says Holma.
The Brigade communiqué says that the arrival of July meant that goods had to be moved to the barracks, which meant that dust could increase for a while.
The atmosphere may have seemed stiff as a result," Mr Holma says.
Poverty and death in the gold country of Indonesia
Bardina Degei does not use heat in the cooking.
Even the roof he uses only rarely.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Panias district, in the troubled province of Papua in Indonesia. When she prepares a dinner, she usually puts a bath - locally "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, a battery burnt down on a bear will be eaten fiercely with bare, unwashed hands.
There are no furniture in Degei's home. He sits in a mud painting area, where he also usually takes care of his daily chores, such as the washing in the sample water from the nearby swamp.
The toilet is provided by a bucket in the ceiling room.
Degei is the youngest of his four wives, and he is not prescribed to take care of fields.
The polygamy is common here.
Late work can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, many drink a lot, and the soldiers have to be taken into account.
"Nobody dares walk in the village after five in the evening," Degei says.
This is a rare curve on the arch of the Papuan highlands, the former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969, following a controversial referendum which forced the 1 026 village elders to vote in public before the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which was opposed to the Dutch Government, quickly turned its hatred towards the government in Jakarta, which is keeping the region firmly under control and preventing foreign journalists and human rights observers from getting there.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua. In the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
The Enarotal is remote and a haddock. The journey starts with a one and a half hour flight from Jayapura, the capital of the province, to Nabire, and continues with an abdominal five-hour drive at the hire car's wheels.
There is no public transport here.
In the town of about 19 000 people, there are wooden houses surrounded by the Bambuates, where the wavelength has been coloured into cellar brown.
Few Indonesians have been here, let alone journalists and foreigners.
Prior to the advent of Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago tribes worshipped the God Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We didn't have any such clothes," Degei explains. He means colourful, handcuffed with his bowl, dark teeth and bright-coloured bag.
"In the past, we only had leaves covered with our watches."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also the gold country of Indonesia.
Paniai is an area about the size of New Jersey, with 153,000 inhabitants. Just a hundred kilometres from Paniai is Grasberg, the largest and most lucrative gold mine in the world, owned by Freeport McMoran, based in the Phoenix United States.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion of timber reserves.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery because they mean the suffocating presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid out nearly $20 million to local military personnel and local units of the army between 1998 and 2004. Up to $150,000 was paid to individual officers.
Papua's demands for more self-determination threaten this source of income and are being mercilessly silenced.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian army has since 1969 killed more than 500 000 clergy soldiers and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacres in the Papuan tribes in the 1970s took on proportions of genocide.
Last year, more than 3 900 people were arrested by the Indonesian police in peaceful demonstrations in the region.
The Brisbane Archbishop report We Will Lose Everything from 2016 contains reports of atrocities in the previous year, such as extrajudicial killings, torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly popular - and ruthless attacks on peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are weekly cases," says Andreas Harsono, a researcher from Human Rights Watch in Indonesia.
Bolts have been tightened as the natural resources of Papua attract immigrants from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of Provinss are Christians, but the demographic structure is changing as the Indonesian populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi move to the area in search of a better livelihood for Muslims.
Jaavalent warung-food stalls sell a fried chicken and a mixture of gado-gado vegetables in a peanuts' pancreas.
It is difficult for locals to compete.
"Migrants have started to sell chicken and vegetables at the market at a lower price than locals," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old from Panias, who moved to the provincial capital for work.
"Local women lost their customers."
In his 2014 election campaign, the Indonesian President, Either Widodo - his favourite name Jokowi - pledged to address the injustices and human rights violations in Papua.
The paper consists of 29 regions and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 districts, including Paniai, on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel let down.
"Our hearts were shattered because we voted for Jokow in 2014 and we expected him to fulfil our wishes and restore justice," you says.
The banks experienced a kind of low point just two months after the investiture of Jokow.
Eleven children were singing Christmas breaks in front of the nun in Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles appeared from the dark.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should wear headlights.
According to Yavedt Teba, the local pastor, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the accounts of the victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers captured children and beaten them with a beast of stone.
Thus one soldier shot at children.
One child, Yulianus Yeimo, aged 16, fell into a coma as a result of ill-treatment.
A few hours later, the building of the State Election Commission near the scene of the event was set on fire and the next day began to happen.
Around 1 000 priests - young men, women and children - gathered in front of a local police and military command centre at the football pitch to demand justice.
They were accompanied by hunting teams for party expenses, and they began to show the traditional waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua, dancing in the rings and imitating the bird's bar.
Some of the demonstrators began to stone police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere heated, the soldiers were ordered in the internal radio system, "If the crowds are resisting more than three times, shoot them to death." Information is based on an official document that the TIME magazine has seen, which has not been made public to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56 inhabitants of Kego Koto, suspected that the situation was getting out of hand and asked the crowds to calm down and return to their homes.
Nobody wanted to listen any more.
"When I turned around, I was shot to the left wrist," she told TIME with her bright-coloured wood stall.
Kayame still does not know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
"Several shots were fired at the crowd."
Alfius Youwi was shot three times. His cousin saw the shooting.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really he," said Yohanes TIME with sorrow. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I dreamed him."
The police chief on Papua, Yotje Mende, told journalists that the police only 'protected' the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Pudjo Sulistiyo, spokesperson for the Papua Police, said in 2015.
"Then it is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many were injured.
The next day information about the grief was gathered in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi made an emotional speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to tackle the violence in Papua.
"I want this case to be investigated immediately so that it never happens again."
In October 2016, the Secretary of State for Security, Mr Wiranto, said that he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the judicial system.
But he immediately started to backtrack.
"Most of the infringements were committed a long time ago.
The 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate infringements, but that requires certain processes."
In an interview with the TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he did not intend to start investigations in Papua.
"Everything is settled in court," he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of 'crimes against humanity' and these crimes are linked to the deaths of more than a thousand people in the bloody declaration of independence of East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been cleared up, including those in Panif.
The families of the banking victims view these allegations with dark disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," says Yohanes.
"I'm already tired of this."
He tells us that he is still living in fear, even though it has been happening for years.
"I am afraid," she says.
"I fear the army will arrest me. I fear I will be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Japanese do not dare to discuss the event.
He says that he had been beaten up by the military when he had helped to bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me in their hands after the burial of the victims," he says.
The shooting has not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deiyai, a neighbouring region of Pansia.
One died and 17 were injured in the conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which arose when the director refused to take a man who had lost consciousness to the hospital, and there were also children among the injured.
A man who needed hospital care was a 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who had been taken on water while fishing on a nearby river and died on the way to hospital.
The innocent villagers demonstrated on the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning signals.
According to local sources, however, the mobile police unit of the Indonesian militia opened fire on the crowd, resulting in the death of one village.
"We are terrified. We are afraid of revenge," says the 29-year-old DominggevBadin, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to treatment.
"I have been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the police officers who fired bullets to be held to account and for the mobile police unit to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of real development breeds dissatisfaction in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes who live on the Papuan knives in the central highlands.
Many have joined the Papuan Liberation Movement (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of the clergy through occasional attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Part of OPM's leaders are from Panias, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Paniai arbitrarily in the name of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some of those arrested will never return.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as 'a sad, forgotten place'.
Poverty feeds discontent.
There is little rice for sale in Enarotal, and this is too expensive for locals,
like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly batteries and some fruit and deciduous fruit.
Farming is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five bacteria.
The bulk of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold in the market.
Ten batteries cost only 10 000 rupias (75 cents).
Over time, differences in livelihoods between locals and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
Jobs are few and usually go to better-educated and wealthier migrants at local level.
Few clergymen have sufficient capital and knowledge to run their own business competitively.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no jobs and no money," says John Gobai, President of the Panas Council of Ministers.
The peripheral Papua gets scant attention worldwide.
In addition, restrictions on international news reporting remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists, Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp, were expelled from Papua, even though they had been granted a rare photography permit, the official reason being their inability to collaborate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, the Asian deputy director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises; he has neither increased transparency nor promoted progress by removing restrictions on news reporting.
"Journalists in the troubled eastern provinces of Indonesia, from Papua to West Papua, face new risks: refusal of visas and blacklisting." Kine stated in his statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian Government is under pressure only from its immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua's "numerous and widespread violations," including the Panis shooting.
These countries have also traditionally supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, denied the allegations and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia remains a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to conceal evidence of human rights violations."
The local people want foreign governments to intervene.
When the Netherlands official delegation, headed by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says the meeting was attended by an anonymous source.
There are 2019 presidential elections in Indonesia, but the clergy tell us that it is no longer likely to vote for Jokow.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who are caught up in a Pantaf shooting operation," says Gobai, President of the Tribal Council.
He wants Somow to know the situation of the panic-stricken: they live in poverty and deprivation by a crowded and unpredictable army, virtually without access to health care and education.
According to Goba, the Japanese, like the other priests, regard the votes they gave to Jokow as a "debt" that has to be repaid.
"They don't want money. They just want justice," he says.
Despite intimidation and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Pantaf shooting incident once again demonstrated symbolically their resistance: they buried one of the victims in the country opposite the police station and the headquarters of the army.
They know that perhaps they will never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget about their crimes.
"My family member was killed," says Yacobus in the buttons.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora barks from the cancellation of Robert Helenius's second match: 'Even your own fans don't want to see'
On 27 May, Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisoran, the boxers of the Raski series, were due to visit the Hartwall arena.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora is wasting the cause of flooding to Helenius completely.
My match in Finland with your flop, but it was not my fault.
I do not live in Finland, I do not want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans did not want to see his match, because he is miserable, Chisora slashes.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in a full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Hellenism won the match with a disputed verdict of points.
In May, the promoter, Nisse Sauerland, told Ilta-Sanom that the match had been moved to the autumn.
There has been nothing new about the game since then.
However, Chisor is no longer annoyed by this withdrawal.
The fact is that the match would probably have had to be cancelled anyway after the illness in Chisora.
On Thursday, three days before the time of the match, I woke up to some tough anger.
My hand was about to explode.
The hospital told me I had to be cut, Chisora says.
Britti says that she is in about 45% condition at the moment.
He does not seem to be interested in a regeneration match with Helenius, but is aiming at Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a defeat at at Whyte in December with a split vote.
The Torch skyscraper in Dubai was conquered a second time by fire
The flames took over one of the highest residential buildings in the world in Dubai on Friday, and hundreds of residents were forced to flee 337 metres from a high 79-floor building.
This was already the second fire in two years in a building called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied, and no one is known to have been injured.
"We were in bed and woke up to the fire alarm and people's cries.
We ran down the stairs on the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes," said Reuters, the resident George.
According to the rescue authorities in Dubai, the fire extinguishers had four o'clock in the morning to cool the building.
The government announced that it would provide accommodation for those who left their home.
The case may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surfaces of high buildings around the world.
The Torch board commissioned a study after the fire in 2015, which found that it was the sheets used to cover and insulate the front that suffered the most damage.
In the UK, the police believe that the London's Grenfell Tower's solitary and veil flights could contribute to the rapid advance of the flames in a fire in which 80 people died in June.
mopeds stolen from the estuary during the night
A moped was stolen from the estuary between 9 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Wednesday.
Mopo disappeared from the Niinivaara from Tikkamäentie 2.
Mopo was marked by Sky Team Monkey.
The colour is red and the registration number is 27-REV.
Mopo was found later on Thursday.
The police will request comments on the moped or its seizure by e-mail to this email address protected from spambots.
You will need the JavaScript support to see it. or by phone to the Police Emergency Unit number 0295 415 320.
Modified on 3 August 2017 at 12.40: The police informed that the moped had been found.
In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers take prohibited objects on board, reveals a survey
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had consciously or unintentionally carried prohibited items onto aeroplanes, bypassing the US Road Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints. At least 6% of passengers had knives or other sharp items that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than 1% said that they only learned afterwards that they had mistakenly transported weapons, munitions or explosives.
The results also show that young passengers are more likely to flout the rules.
19.7% of those who knowingly breached TSA rules were Y-generation passengers and less than 15% belonged to the X-generation.
The most frequent violations were the export of food and liquids on board aircraft.
More than 3% admitted that they had deliberately taken steel items on board, and 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men said that they had consciously taken these drugs on board.
The questionnaire was carried out by a company which wanted to find out how many had accidentally passed the security check on smuggling goods and how many had deliberately done so.
It is not surprising that the most frequent travellers are also the most likely to take away security checks - consciously or unknowingly - smuggling goods.
But as the questioner states, TSA's instructions are quite complicated and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids are allowed on board and how much.
So it is no surprise that the majority of TSA seizures are liquids.
For a while, there was also a prevailing belief that books could not be taken on board a plane.
They may be taken on domestic flights, but not for international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, fainted his decision to delay the decisions taken by Obama during the period to reduce emissions
The day after the 15 states had taken the head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, to court, Pruitt withdrew its previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama Administration's decisions on smoke-reducing emissions.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he heads takes better account of the needs of the environmental decision-makers in the federal states than previous administrations.
Mr Pruitt did not say a word about the action brought against his earlier decision at the Federal Court of Appeal.
The Länder should start to comply with the 2015 ground level for ozone from 1 October.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone the implementation of decisions by one year, so that his agency had more time to familiarise itself with the plan, because the agency 'does not want to interfere in local decision-making or hamper economic growth'.
Pruitt was the public prosecutor in the State of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as head of the EPA.
Since joining Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to block or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industries.
The sudden change of mind on Wednesday is the latest setback to the Pruitt plan to tone down the regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington issued a decision that the head of the EPA exceeded his mandate in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama Administrative Decision on oil and gas companies, which obliged companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, Pruitt argued that his about-turn on the ozone regulations only strengthens the EPA's cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at fulfilling the new requirements on time.
"Under previous regimes, EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then expected activist groups and others to take it to court to agree on timetables," Pruitt said. In his previous position, he sued the Environment Agency over ten times.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it gives us."
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt can continue to use its 'power to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers' to ensure that the provisions 'are justified and based on the best available information'.
In Congress, the Republicans are pushing for a wider change in the ozone regulations.
The aim of the bill adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
Mr Eric Schneiderman, the public prosecutor of the State State State of New York, who led the EPA State consortium which took legal action this week, said that the group would continue to exert pressure.
"The change of mind of the EPA as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6.7 million people in New York and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities," said Schneiderman.
In addition to New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Orego, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia were involved.
Ground level ozone occurs when emissions from, for example, cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog may cause severe breathing difficulties for vulnerable groups, and it is also responsible for thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists welcomed the surprising change of direction in Pruitt.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required to bring common sense to a guy in charge of our air of breathing," says Lori Ann Burd from the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump regime, which has the ideological objective of acting on behalf of polluters and other self-serving groups."
The shuttle of the super-car manufacturer - "takes place in the style of Ferrari"
It will also invest in hybrid sports cars, while at the same time trying to maintain its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in the style of Ferrari, President Sergio Marchionne said about the plans at a briefing on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be unveiled next year when the Italian super-car manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, following a report by Automotive News.
All cases of measles in eastern Savo of the same type of virus
The measles in the Gulf is the same type of virus as the previous cases in Eastern Savo, says THL.
The viral laboratory of the Institute of Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that East Savo's fifth ash infection is the same as previous infections.
THL has ensured that the measles infection confirmed on Friday 28 July by a beach almel is the same type of virus as the previous cases of East Savo.
On the basis of this information, all the infections detected in eastern Savo relate to the first measles detected in the area in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not discussed other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that in the meantime between August new infections can occur after the fifth victim and thus the epidemic is not yet over, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, the doctor responsible for basic healthcare infectious diseases in Soster.
No new outbreaks of measles or doubts have emerged since the fifth confirmed incident.
However, it is also important that everyone should ensure that their own vaccination protection is up to date, Mr Erkkila reminds us.
More on the subject: three new measles infections were confirmed in Pirkanmaa - "Additional infections or epidemics highly unlikely"
Finland prepares for a permit
Pontika soup was not even considered to be legal.
The underlying argument is that the process produces spirits alongside methanol, which is toxic.
It will be legal next year to prepare the stone at home, but the legalisation of the pontificate soup is not even considered.
Kilju is made by fermentation, pontikka by distillation.
The reason behind distillation regulation is that the process of producing methanol in addition to wine, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to make a show of strength as a right of access to private land, and the government adviser Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the Alcohol Code, pontika distillation was not considered to be legalised.
Nor was it brought to the political table.
There was no discussion on the release of the distillation, says Mr Outi Mäkelä (coo).
He is a member of the negotiating team of the ruling parties' parliamentary groups, which took a stand on the reform of the alcohol law.
Permit for distillation at the home of the pontika cannot be granted even from the application.
Commercial production will also remain subject to authorisation.
Import tells us that there will be a simple rule for the production of alcoholic beverages at home: alcohol can be produced by fermentation at home.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally make a shield at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes requirements for flavourings and flavourings and allows for the manufacture of a shield, Mäkelä specifies.
Manufacturing must be carried out in such a way that raw materials, or the flavourings and flavourings produced during their production, are clearly visible in the drink.
Under the new law, drinks can be produced for themselves as much as they like, and self-made alcohol can be given as a gift.
It is still not allowed to be put on sale.
The act of Kilju is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much greater change took place in 2004 with the release of passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries.
Seventy-five per cent of alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The draft alcohol law is now being examined by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act comes before the Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if Parliament had already spoken, Mäkelä is happy.
Oscar Pistorius was contested in hospital with armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered breast damage, was contested at a South African hospital for heart attacks.
Pistorius has already been released from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence in Attgeville prison.
According to the British newspaper Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning with armed guards.
Pistorius suffered chest problems, but he was able to get out of the hospital in the afternoon.
The prisoner's spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was being taken to hospital for investigations.
The spokesperson for the family of Pistorius, on the other hand, told us that the former top athlete was in good shape.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced the six-fold paralympic medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkampi.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Littered telephone conversations reveal that Trump put pressure on Mexico to build a border wall
Mechanisms in telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the Mexican and Australian leaders have been leaked to Washington Post.
During a telephone conversation on 27 January 2017, Mr Trump called on the Mexican President, Enrique Peña Nieto, to end his public speech that he did not intend to pay the proposed border wall.
The US President blamed Nieto for having publicly thwarted the wall project. "You cannot say that to the press," Trump said.
Mr Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also published a littering of Trump's first telephone call to Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister of Australia. There was a tense exchange of views during the call.
Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement whereby the United States would take in refugees on their way to Australia is 'ridiculous', 'miserable' and 'stupid' and, according to Trump, the agreement negotiated under Obama would make him look like 'idiots' because he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the call by saying to Turnbull 'this was the most unpleasant call of the day'.
Georgia massacre: Aktivists restate racist lynching in the hope of justice
The Ford Mercury car will overtake the crowd in the small town of Monroe in the Georgian countryside and continue its journey towards the small bridge of Moore's Ford.
The car has four black passengers and a white driver, and four armed men are blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
A leader, a middle-aged man dressed in a breath of fresh air, takes a deep breath of his cigar and bricks through the windscreen.
Passengers are afraid.
"Roger, n----u!" the man grows up.
"Out of the car!"
Humours break the silence when a young black man is pulled out the front door.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a rehash, which was presented on 22 July 2017.
However, the sighs of the shock are genuine when the noose is put on the neck of the 'Roger'.
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to the bridge of Moore's Ford to stage the events of 1946, when Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been charged with murder.
"It is disconcerting that no one has been arrested in these years - even though the murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps to reorganise the rebirth.
"It is a disgrace in history, but above all it is a burden that weighs on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and a former Georgian congressman.
For him, the re-staging is a startling invitation to action, and reminds the people of Monroe that injustice has never been put right.
"We want the guilty to be brought to justice. We want to see things finally concluded, and we want to recover from grief and reconcile, but above all we want justice," says Brooks.
"We cannot recover and reconcile until we get justice."
The body of the victim, who died in the massacre in Georgia, is covered by death investigators on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI documents received by the NBC news, more than 50 men from Monro and the surrounding districts were suspected of lynching.
However, no one was accused of murder.
Even though the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say that the motives for lynching have been known to the local people all the time: politics and sex.
In 1946, the black people of the state of Georgia were given the Supreme Court's decision to vote for the first time in the presidential elections, which the Supreme Court ruled in April and which took place in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident at the time of the election in which a black tenant farmer, Roger Malcom, stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight which apparently concerned Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, the city was rumored that Hester had had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting this child.
According to information from the FBI, the influential white landowner, Loy Harrison, paid on 25 July 1946 for the USD 600 guarantees of Malcom against which he was released from prison.
On their way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their cars before the bridge of Moore's Ford.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and organised the murders," says the FBI report.
"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities. The authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Mr Brooks will be more succinct.
"It was a vote murder," she says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to the black people that it would be the same for them if they were to vote."
Cassandra Greene has guided the rearrangement of the massacre in Georgia for almost a decade.
It is an extremely realistic and imprisoned proposal, a description of the appalling racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from today's United States.
It is difficult to see the performance, but even more difficult not to see what Greenen thinks is meant to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because we'd have to face our own dark sides as well," the director says.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
This year's exercise started in June. On the first day, about 30 actors - a dozen black and twenty white - gathered to listen to Greenen's rutined summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is the deputy director of Greene.
He has been putting forward the local leader of Ku Klux Klan for years in a rebirth, but he always plays an equally difficult and repugnant role.
"There's going to be a dirty feeling because I'm not myself," says Marbaugh.
"It is important, however, that this side of history is also brought to the fore so that it never happens again."
Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, practise their shifts on the other side of the room.
The performance begins with a scene where Malcom shouts and worms Hester. He is furious that Hesterile has had a relationship with Dorothy.
"Don't you hear? I said leave my country, n--u!"
Rascona eli Hester replies.
Then start the beat.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) will squeeze the nail.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" Rascona asks.
He is confused.
"Would it be too hard by accident?" he asks.
"No," says Greene.
"I just don't think the whites used the word n--u at the time."
"So," the other black actor confirms.
"It's a slang language. You have to use a longer version."
The subject matter of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is powered by a spirit of fellowship.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the motion; they want to honour the memory of those who have died.
The meeting starts from scratch.
Now Rascona's words are blessing.
No one laughs.
The reshuffle is quickly and violently coming to an end.
Auror, shots - and silence.
A woman wearing a black funeral clothing stands beside her and sings the Strange Fruit of Billie Holiday.
His voice is broken with every other word.
A few ten metres away, fifty spectators sweep sweat and tears in their eyes.
Almost exactly half the audience is black and half white.
Among them is a couple who have come to look at a show from Ithacasta in New York State, but most are local.
They have visited the victims' graves in Georgia's pressing moisture, under the auspices of Brooks.
The murders have become reality from the story. The atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song, Greene invites the crowd to check the bodies.
Children are able to look on artificial blood and immobile bodies and whisper to each other.
"They have not really died," the little boy mutes like a reminder of himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
Actresses who played the role of the Lyniers are pulling their strings and wiping out tears.
Bradshaw hurts Marbaugh, a man who was nominated by Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then burns in tears after a tough performance.
"Don't worry," the woman who was involved in the motion comforts.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for good reason."
Later, the public and the actors will gather for a common dinner.
The white couple from Altanta will have a lively discussion on the performance with the black-skinned couple they have just met.
It is difficult for Denise Duplinski to find words when he describes the feelings aroused by the performance.
"It's hard to listen to horrible words and watch the horrible deeds that are said and done by people who look the same as you - just because they look the same as you," he says.
"The performance made me realize that lynchings are still going on," he added. "It's just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks remembers the development of civil rights for listeners at the same table.
She says that she has already begun planning the proposal for next year.
"Resettlement is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also an educational experience," says Brooks.
"Its message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it."
Depending on the plants in the shops will stir: This amount of "extra parts" actually saves
Is it permissible to remove flower leaves already in the store before weighing?
What about taking the big hat out of the bag - it weighs no matter how much?
The answers are very divided: for some, it is a sign of nuance being taken to extremes; for others, it is not a question of paying for the parts of vegetables which are not used and which, however, go into rubbish at home.
The phenomenon is recognized in shops.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket in Ruohola, in Helsinki, because many people tear the flower columns, for example.
The magazine from the box is exported to the market for bio-waste.
According to the news published by the financial media, shovels on the vegetable tissue are amazing to traders.
But how much does removing the extra vegetable components before weighing up actually save money?
How significant is it, in fact, that we are dealing with a bulldozer?
We women tested how the price changes when you take the leaves or the positions away from the pineapple, the latva-articulate, the delicate mushroom, the flower and the park.
Flower: A flower cake costing €2.10 cost €1.80 when it was peeled out by all newspapers.
Ananas: The price of a whole anarchy costing EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its position was turned off.
Latva-articulate: The price of EUR 2.60 came to EUR 2.40 when the short-term stock was cut off.
Herbal mushrooms: The two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price came to 60 cents.
Parsakaali: The Central Garden paid 1 euro and 80 cents without a position.
The result: If you start to tear loose leaves and strains, you save at best a few dozen cents for one vegetable.
In percentage terms, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20%.
A total of EUR 1.20 would have been saved from these purchases!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - a BrassiStar made a five-year contract with PSG
Neymar, the Brazilian star, has signed a five-year contract with the French Football Club PSG, according to the AFP news agency.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar representatives had paid FC Barcelona, a football player in the Spanish league, an extraction price of EUR 222 million.
The transfer of a staggering EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
In the past, the record was in Manchester United, which paid out EUR 105 million last summer from Paul Pogbas, a Frenchman.
Earlier on Thursday, the Spanish league blocked the move when it rejected the first payment company of the Neymar Representatives.
According to the rules of the league, the buying club cannot pay the receipt directly to the seller, but the player must actually buy out his contract, which will be done by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, the PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and its representatives, who provided the money via the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He may be presented to the new home audience at the opening of the PSG season on Saturday against Amiens.
Uefa examines the details
In a note, Barcelona also announced that it would provide information on payments to the European Football Association, Uefa, so that the association can determine the disciplinary action which might be taken in the case.
For example, Javier Tebas, Chairman of the Spanish League, has suspected PSG using its money to break the rules of economic fairness in Uefa.
Uefa can be punished by a club that makes more than EUR 30 million in losses in three years.
According to Uefa, the transfer of Neymar does not automatically violate its economic article.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG will affect the company's finances for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell a number of players for substantial sums, Uefa was announced.
Qatar Sports Investment is owned by PSG, a state-owned qatar company.
It is chaired by a former tennis professional, Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.
Clouds for Neymar
Austin, 21, was hit by violent burns of lightning - the flame was stored in the airport security camera
Austin Dunn was on a regular flight at Lounas-Florida International Airport with a couple of colleagues, as a result of a sudden onset of lightning from the rain on a plane.
Salaman power threw the plane into the land of Dunn, which is near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to hospital.
He had third-degree burns around his body.
My father called me and said that my brother got hold of the electric car and he is in hospital.
I asked if he was alive," says Austin's sister, Autumn.
The Austin spent two weeks in a hospital.
In addition to the cormorants, he also had muscle damage and cerebral bleeding.
The experience was a tough one for the whole family.
That cannot be expected.
It's traumatic for everyone," says Autumn.
According to the representative of the airport, the cryptographic warning system was on site at the time of the incident and the hauliers themselves decide whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3,000 jobs and revives the business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British education group Pearson announced a reduction of 3 000 jobs and a 72% cut in dividends, starting a new restructuring programme in response to the pressures on its business.
According to the CEO, John Fallon, the job cuts will be made mainly at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019. The company has already lost 4,000 jobs in previous restructuring operations.
Pearson announced that he would cut costs again by £300 million in May as part of his third austerity programme to revive business that has been weakened as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month Pearson decided to sell his share of the Penguin Random House to his partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would maintain its current outlook for the year. In the first half of the year, its turnover increased by 1 per cent to GBP 2.05 billion.
Attack in escort to Kabul: NATO soldier killed in a suicide attack
A suicide bomber struck a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, and according to the authorities, a NATO soldier was killed and many others wounded.
According to a statement by NATO, five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the attack on the Kabul Qarabagh region.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, on Tuesday 30 people were killed in an explosion in the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people died in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to a NATO statement, the explosion on on Thursday evening occurred when a joint patrol of the NATO and Afghan armed forces was attacked by an 'self-perpetrated explosive device'.
The opinion reported that all the injured were in a stable condition and were treated in a US military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are major concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1 662 civilians, including 20% in the capital, were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017.
At the end of July, at least 30 people were killed by a car bomb in a suicide attack in Kabul, a region where mainly Shiite Muslims live.
The Taliban declared themselves to be behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in the centre of Kabul, the most devastating attack by a militant faction in the country since the US-led forces toppled the Taliban in 2001.
The violence underlines the fragility of the situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump considers whether the US will deploy more troops to assist the local army and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, in the policies it is pursuing and, in particular, in President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA overturns its decision to postpone the implementation of smog rules
The EPA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, reversed its decision to delay the implementation of the decisions taken under the Obama Administration to reduce smog emissions one day after 15 states had taken the agency to court.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 so-called "ozone precision" late on Wednesday. According to the Agency, the decision reflects its commitment to cooperation with the Länder.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the federal states," Scott Pruitt said in the agency's statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone limits by one year until October 2018, by measuring the degree of smog in certain parts of the country in order to determine where pollutants need to be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the Agency took legal action against 15 states, mainly run by democrats, including the District of Columbia, which found it illegal to postpone implementation.
President Donald Trumpi's administration has been looking for ways to mitigate the environmental regulations of Barack Obama, which is part of a broader economic growth agenda.
The Trump measures have been opposed by democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
The EPA website says that breathing in the ozone-containing air "can impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a leading figure in the father had also sent a bomb to Sydney.
The suspicion was that the bomb was to be carried on board the aircraft on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police do not explain in detail why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a toxic colourless gas breakdown device and take the equipment to a crowded public location, for example a public transport facility.
Michael Phelan, Deputy Supreme Allied Commissioner, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were seized in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation is also continuing.
Managing Director of liquid: Renewable fuels fared well
The oil refiner of Neste's income before taxes fell, but slashed projections in the second quarter.
According to the CEO, Matti Lievose, the company performed well in oil products, the sales of renewable products reached a record level and the operating profit of the Marketing & Services segment was moving in the right direction.
Last year, comparative profits were improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax.
According to Lievose, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and a more favourable market, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and will complete the strategic investments we have already announced in 2017."
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomathenko discuss a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomathenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of a series of less than 66.7 kilograms, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms in the ESPN sports cabinet in Los Angeles, until Mikey Garcia, the champion of the WBC's invincible lightweight book, walked along the corridor to greet Lomathenko, the champion of WBO's most common sailor.
On Saturday, Garcia won on Showtime by a unanimous decision of the former four-grade world champion Adrien Broner, and since then Garcia and Lomathenko have been among the top five boxers of the different printing classes on a comparative list.
Garcia stretched his right hand and asked, "How is it, the master?
Good luck!"
Mrs Lomathenko will defend her title against Miguel Marriage on the ESPN channel on seven Saturday.
When the two box posed to photographers, the manager of Lomathenko, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the match between men would be 'perfect in terms of size'.
"I'm a former husband-arch," Garcia reminded.
"I moved a series up for Broner [63.5 kilos] but I'm not that big.
I am a tiny 63.5-kilogram.
I want to go back to the lightweight.
He must rise to the lightweight [61.2 kilograms]. Then we can skip.
That is what our fans are hoping for.
Let us fulfill their wishes."
Mrs Lomatchenko was of the same opinion.
"Boxing needs this match."
Klimas asked whether the match should be held by means of a subscription channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomathenko to debyut later this year and to match next summer against Garcia (37-0, 30 kg profits), Garcia would also be interested in facing Jorge Linares and Campke Campaign match in September 23.
"The match could be a payment channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later declared that he was ready to match on a channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else is attracting as much attention.
It suits me as soon as an agreement is reached ..."
Garcia said that he appreciated Lomathenko as an 'incredible match', and that he would perhaps go and see Saturday's match.
Lomathenko interrupted the acclaim of Garcia in the goat and said that this three-weight champion from Riversi looked 'really slow. Sori, Mike... but you needed it to be knocked out'.
Garcia said that he had concentrated first on the display of shock force and then on boxing.
The men said that they felt there was a strong desire to see a match between them.
"This is the game that is expected.
No other match arouses as much attention and interest.
I am definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomathenko said that he expected to be able to fight the best. "Mikey is legend.
It will be a great match."
Average salary of 5 300 euros, education for what happens - Investment advice status was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been much talked about recently.
The last time Helsinki Sanomat told about Ritvasta, 68, to which the investment advisers of the bankers spoke full bundle when selling investment products.
At the beginning of next year, the rules on investment advisers and the sale of various investment products will be tightened up.
The requirements are based on the new Financial Services Directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the expertise of investment advisers and of the employees who sell investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not specify any skills requirements.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service complete its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of examinations for the APV investment graduates firm, whose graduate group includes experts from financial supervision (Fiva), universities and industry alike.
The examinations are from 12 to 15 credits, and their exams are compiled by Aalto EE, an Aalto University Executive Education Ltd, which provides business development services.
Its website says that, in general, both exams are "fairly broad in terms of requirements."
The teaching materials of the diplomas consist of 10-15 books, as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, Managing Director of APV, says that the penetration rate of the exams is roughly 70.
Of the employees of the largest banks, more or less all those offering investment services have completed either an APV1 or an APV2 qualification because they are required to do so under their own rules.
Then there are the smaller bankers, without naming names, whose staff seem to have mapped out the completion of their examinations, Savikko says.
According to him, there are "few" such banker movements.
According to Saviko, between 13 000 and 14 000 graduates have completed APV1 since 2000 and some 3 000 people have completed more demanding APV2 degrees recommended to investment advisers.
Some bankers consider graduation to be an advantage.
Several other sectors have significantly stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that a financial recommendation requires that APV qualifications be completed, because that is when the expertise in the investment sector is secured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisers earn on average several thousand euros a month, including commissions, benefits in kind and performance bonuses.
The average monthly salary on a regular basis is approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, working men earn more than EUR 5 900 per month and women earn more than EUR 4 500 per month.
On average, the ten largest earning percent earns about EUR 8 100.
The ten men who earn the most earn more than EUR 9 000 a month or more, the one tenth of the women who earn the most, earn EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment Services Act (ISD) advisory services can only be provided by a licensed company.
Up to now, there has been a reliance on self-regulation at the level of the workforce and the tasks.
According to Fiva, the audit it carried out received individual cases in which the expertise and competence of the investment advisor was not sufficient according to the advisor's activities.
In principle, you can also be a seller of investment products, even if your skills and qualifications are at a low level.
Basically, the situation has been wild and free in this respect.
Several other industries have significantly stricter skills requirements," says Savikko.
Saviko says that from the beginning of next year this will be tightened up with the new MiFID II directive.
This presupposes that every company is responsible for ensuring that the personnel providing investment services are sufficiently skilled.
Financial supervision, in turn, should be empowered to prescribe what needs to be known.
Marko Hovi, Fiva's market expert, says that one of the clear changes to the current regulation is the regulation on requirements for the expertise and experience of investment advisers and investment product sellers.
According to Hov, the new requirements apply both to the personnel of the investment firms themselves and to the captive agents who sell the products on behalf of a company.
Hovi tells that, according to a government proposal from the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will be empowered to prescribe knowledge and experience.
Exactly what they are will be decided in the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and further training.
All this has to be documented, and the company has an obligation to show that it has been done.
Hovi specifies that in practice the company must, for example, map the personnel's assignments at the individual level.
This will certainly be subject to different standards, depending on whether we are talking about investment advice or product sales.
According to Hov, there is also a requirement to work with a fixed period if the level of knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
In other words, if a company employs a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work for a certain time with the person who meets the criteria.
"The change will make the rules more stringent and more concrete."
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
Figure: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane "drew" a giant plane on the United States
The route of the aircraft was drawn to the United States on the Flightradar24 service.
The flight was carried out on Thursday with 787 Dreamliner, which Boeing tested the durability of the Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The aircraft that left Seattle flew for 18 hours and 1 minute for a distance of 15 700 kilometres, which is longer than any available regular commercial route flights in the world.
The flight stayed within the borders of the United States all the time.
It flew through 17 states.
The persistent children of Imatra's beach pupils do not mock the rain or the sun's pope - the Jesnes of All was persevering with the help of the swimming village
Iines All progressed at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra's beach schools revolve around Liettella and Lempuka this week and next.
Even if between rains and then shines again, young swimmers are not in the mosquito, boasts the tower of Taina Itkonen.
In the bathing schools this week, a total of 13 children will be added to swimming skills, and next week a dozen will be added.
The number of children in the coming week was influenced by the fact that the school and eskari were already starting, evaluated Itkonen.
The Imatra Coastal School is organised jointly by the Sport-unifying project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, there was a nice atmosphere at the beach of Liette.
The sun was shining and young swimming schools were training to stay on the surface with swimming plasters, some of them already.
Smaller siblings also lived in the water.
Iines of All, 5, conjectured the first deeper into the water going.
But Taina Itkonen encouraged her to pedal towards the beach.
Good luck!
Iines All told that she had been in a lot of swimming this summer.
The beach of Lietten is good for her.
As with everything, Vili Huhtanen, 5, practiced swimming with the village.
You too can be pleased with today's achievements, the swimming pool praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, on the other hand, wanted water wars from time to time.
Ilona Villberg, her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, who followed the swimming from the beach, sees the beach school as a good start to the swimming course.
Even though the weather has been what hurts, Anna has fooled to go here every day.
Between them had to be heated.
Bathing schools were packed into the pier.
The boys were busy with the frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg, spread to the pasture the towels, leaning fruit and flying the day.
Teaching in the water already continued, but the pier was not in a hurry.
That's when you don't get to the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilets - 'Here is a story that unites us like this'.
You can see it all.
A few days ago, Sinitu, a cleaning product, launched the Tuntemato military product series.
In other words, distillers and towns - as well as the 'wc-harja-side' section.
An unknown soldier in the autumn is referring to a film and the marketing of a toy.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products are defiled in the social media: When will there be unidentified health ties?
You have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Vice-President of SinituProduct, say?
We are the co-operative of the film.
Like many other companies, we are supporting this film.
We wanted to support domestic production and the culture film," Ms Mätta says.
According to him, there will be a special display for the products, and the film will thus be visible.
Is there not something funny here - often when you think that products and related stories have something in common?
Yes, here is the story of such a unifying story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products," Ms Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports his basic Finnish values, which are supported by those who have seen the old, unidentified soldier.
And cleaning is not alien to military culture either, Määttä points out.
Other business partners in the unknown soldier movie include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall vichyt has been introduced, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products already had to be perverted by the Finnish Image magazine blog Kalle Kinnune
Coffee and clocks are already available.
Mrs Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the first evening of the film, so there is still some way to go.
For example, Valio, Jalostaya, Neste and the German retail goods chain Lidl, Kinnunen, have not yet discovered their products of war.
New results of the age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden were published
The most recent results of the medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been published, but the results of the tests carried out using the new method of evaluation show that more than 80% of those tested were determined to be over 18 years old, but not everyone believes that the tests are reliable.
The Swedish National Medical Office started testing earlier this year.
The tests will make it possible to assess the asylum seeker's age more precisely, and the new test was introduced following criticism of the Swedish Immigration Agency for its failure to determine the real age of applicants claiming to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has carried out 6 880 tests so far, and the Finnish Medical Office has now published the results of 2 481 tests, which were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
In addition, in 25 cases, the Finnish Judicial and Veterinary Office specified that the test was 'possibly 18 years old or older'.
432 cases resulted in the conclusion that the asylum seeker is 'possibly under 18 years of age'.
Tests were only carried out in cases where there was reason to suspect the age indicated by the applicant.
Mr Göransson's Office for Law Medicine tells us that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly consistent. There are no major differences between the statistics of the previous months," he told The Local Journal.
Although a large number of applicants were identified as over 18 years old, this does not necessarily mean that they have lied of their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and indicated that in 442 cases there were 'indications that the investigation was 18 years old or older'.
When Svenska Dagbladet looked at the same results, it turned out that 243 cases had been openly reported that the applicant would be 18 years old this year.
The medical age assessment method used in tests will include x-rays of wisdom and magnetic images of polviniver, and then dentists and radiologists will analyse the images. The method has also been criticised.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karoline Institute, whose work includes an assessment of the biological maturity of humans, to determine whether a person has reached puberty earlier than usual or later.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the method used is the right one.
Defining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot definitely determine age, we should not pretend that we can do that," he said to the newspaper Metro.
However, the forensic agency, Göransson, defended the accuracy of the tests: "Generally speaking, one can say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test is about 18 years old, at a risk of around 10%."
Ilonen collapsed in 30 places in Scotland
Five more than par results in the third round spent Mikko Ilonen's 30 articles on the result slippery slope downwards in the European tour of golf in Scotland.
Ilonen left for Saturday Day in divided place 11, but was found at the end of the round to distribute seat 41.
One tuplabog was gathered in a difficult coil to accompany three bogs.
Others had trouble too.
Ian Poulter, an Englishman, rose to distribute a leading position in one under-par round, although he said that there was enough work to be done on the umbrella.
The story was raw, but the hangover was there and eventually the day was good, Poulter thought.
He will share with his fellow countryman, Callum Shinkwin, and with Andrew Dodt from Australia.
The Governor of West Virginia changes the party
On Thursday evening, the democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced at the Trump campaign that he would change party.
"The democrats simply rejected me," Justice said.
"Today, after many prayers and thorough reflection, I can tell you... Today I tell the people of Western civilisation that I can no longer help you as Governor of Democrats."
The audience resorted to resounding applause.
"Tomorrow, I will be a member of a registered Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say to you that it is time for a new game."
Mr Trump promised earlier that a major announcement would be made at the Western Virginia campaign.
Trump won in Western Virginia at 42 points because Justice did not support the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited from his father a mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
His property is worth about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) published a statement on Thursday evening that 'Governor Yustice's party election is yet another blow to a democratic party that is building barriers rather than a better America'.
"The democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership whatsoever and is unable to find a positive message that unites people," RNC representative Ronna McDaniel said in her statement to the CBS news.
Salamate sowed injury - Thursday is even the summer's very thunder day
Other crowns will be received in southern Finland towards the end of the week.
During the past week there has been thunder especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the south-west of Finland.
During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes caused many fires.
According to Meteorologi, Thursday could be a very thunder day for the summer so far.
The clubs have finally found Finland as well.
During the past week there has been concealment, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of South-West Finland.
In the midst of the lightning, a row strikes the electric centre, causing a small fire.
The emergency services received about a quarter to midnight notice of the fire on Wednesday.
The electric centre was located in the sauna at the end of the row.
The fire extinguisher wrecked the roof and the wall to find fire hotspots and put out the fire briskly.
Eleven homes were left without electricity, but personal injury was avoided.
On holiday, the lightning set the outside building on fire at Harjulanti before midnight.
When the civil protection plant arrived, the building was already in full swing, and the rescue agency could only prevent the fire from spreading.
Around fifty square metres of an outdoor building burnt to the ground.
On the mouth of the Kuopio in the Rhine village, the lightning strikes at a private house.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flaring lightning strike.
The civil protection agency went there to check the case, but this time the lightning did not cause a fire - only a few molds left.
In traffic, the thunderstorm caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when the lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
The information about the defect was provided on Thursday morning between eight and nine, after which the trains in the meantime were replaced by buses.
The problem was not resolved until just before five o'clock in the afternoon.
Since then, rail traffic has been able to continue normally on a stretched track.
Salamates have devastated various parts of Finland.
However, there has been a relatively low level of secrecy this summer.
This summer's thunderstorms have been quite endless! Estimates the meteorologist Jari Tuovinen, a friend of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday have mainly had moderate proportions, but thanks to the small brown ald in the summer, many people even feel strong.
This might seem like a tough thunder, but that's what it's been compared to this summer's thunder," says Tuovinen.
On Wednesday, the ground floor collapsed 1 700 times, and Thursday has had the potential even to be one of the busiest weather days in the summer: by around 16 o'clock, 1 790 ground was covered in the plaque.
If the cryptography still continues early in the evening, more than two thousand lights can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record year of thunder was in 2015, when the year's cryptography was approximately 30,000.
By Wednesday this year's cryptography had increased to 18 386.
So there is still some catching up to be done so that this year does not break the 'record' of two years ago.
But we can expect the threat to continue.
According to Tuovi, the air mass above Finland will remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a breeding environment for the particles.
The focus of the attacks is likely to shift from the northern parts of the country to the south on Saturday, where some 2 000 lightning days can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
There will be a more homogeneous rainfall in central parts of the country.
According to Tuovi, there is only a small amount of thunder in such cases.
Coe praises Russia's "open-minded" apology for the doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the world's athlete, praised the apologies she had given on Thursday in connection with the doping scandal, but he added that it was not yet time to lift the ban on Russia's participation.
On the eve of the World Cup, on Thursday, at the IAAF Congress, the Russian Chief of Sport, Dmitry Shljahtin, said that the ban on Russia was appropriate and that he was determined to combat doping.
He said he regretted 'all the athletes who were deprived of their gold or silver medals in the competitions'.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the extension of the ban, which was ruled out in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report had provided evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very direct. It was a very open-minded show," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and Congress welcomed the recognition by the Russian Federation of Universal Sports that the country had been through difficult times and that it would do its utmost to reorganise its activities."
Coe also said it was 'satisfied' that Russia accepted the terms of ending the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the group's recommendation that now is not the time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes are competing with neutral athlete status in the World Sports Championships starting on Friday in London, fulfilling the strict criteria of the IAAF.
On Monday, Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF working group, said that Russia still has a number of requirements to meet before its status can be restored.
"Testing is still insufficient and coaches banned continue to operate freely," he explained to journalists on Friday, after his presentation to the Council of IAAF in London.
The production company was disappointed by the poor performance of the Tom of Finland film
Tom of Finland did not succeed as the authors hoped, says Yle.
Frankly, I am disappointed to acknowledge that the film was produced in an interview with Annika Sucksdorff Yle, Managing Director of Helsinki Film.
I was afraid that the Finnish film public might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film received its first evening in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached more than 100 000 spectators, which is a small proportion of the film budget, some EUR 5 million.
There was no lottery profit from this, but now it is important that investors get their own back.
If the film had been more successful at home, they would already have had their money.
Now we have to wait for small bits of foreign circulation," says Sucksdorff.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukosken.
What is the impact of the financial rules of football on the transfer of Neymar to Paris?
The restrictions on the use of European football clubs' money do not prevent the transfer of Neymar from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germaini in France, the most expensive transfer of football ever.
With regard to the possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germention (PSG), UEFA, which regulates European football, can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
UEFA introduced fair play rules in 2011, according to which PSG must be able to prove that the Neymar transfer has been financed without major losses.
EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona to terminate the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar's annual salary in the new club will be in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a wide range of economic considerations.
PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar's transfer fee and attaching him to its star guard, as it will finance a ruling family that has grown rich with Qatar's oil.
Followers are allowed to spend large sums on acquiring players, but they must be balanced by real sources of income so that the football business is not loss-making.
The Fair Game Economic Rules were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platini, the French President-elect of UEFA in 2007.
As a former football player, Platini thought that the pursuit of success by getting into debt was a sham and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play economic rules shifted from the debts of clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model first used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 was severely disrupted, and Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year assessment period for Fair Game Economic Rules will last until 2018, allowing clubs to make up to €30 million in losses.
Although Mr Platini had to leave office of UEFA's president scandalously in 2015, his successor, Mr Ceferin, also wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
"Fair play rules are still in place and we will continue to apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, the EU's Commissioner for Fair Trade, told Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract at a lump sum, it may record the amount in the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has entered into a five-year agreement, so the transfer amount can be entered in the EUR 44.4 million per year for the next five years.
Based on fair play economic rules, a first set of sanctions was issued in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, which is financed from Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million. In addition, the club was ordered to limit its 21 players in the Champions League group for the period 2014-2015, instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies linked to its owners.
For example, if a company in Qatar supports PSG, but the value of the subsidy is considered to be above the normal level of the market, UEFA will not calculate the aid as such.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support for PSG by the Qatar Tourism Authority was excessive.
It has also become apparent that part of Neymar's earnings in PSG could be financed by contributions from the World Cup Organizing Commission in Qatar in 2022.
The PSG and the organising committee have, however, denied that Neymar was being turned into an ambassador for the World Cup, and UEFA would find it very easy to expose such an arrangement.
As a result of past sanctions by PSG, UEFA is following even more closely attempts to circumvent the rules.
Informed sources reported on Thursday that UEFA has not negotiated with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
The sources gave an interview to Associated Press , on condition that their identity is not disclosed because they are not authorised to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG's net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and the operating profit was more than EUR 10 million.
Last year's accounts have not yet been published.
PSG expects that the arrival of Neymar will attract new sponsors and increase the sales of related products and shirts.
The Society estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent with the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish league, clearly irritated at the departure of one of the best players in the world, attempted to make it more difficult for Neymar to move, allegedly breaking the rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic doping case both for the club and the state," said Javier Tebas, Chairman of the Spanish League, to the Spanish newspaper AS. By the state, he referred to the qatari ownership of the PSG.
Arsenal's manager, Arsene Wenger, also has reservations about the state funding of a football club owned by an American sports club.
"The incident is the result of ownership that has completely changed the environment in football over the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
Fair play becomes very difficult to comply with financial rules. There are so many interests involved in the fact that the famous player represents the state."
Now it's urgent: the coach of the Finnish MM athletes stuck in Helsinki
The little guys Arttu Pajulahden and the three mercenaries Kristiina Mäkelä's coach Suren Ghazaryan are stuck in Helsinki, although he should be training for athletics at the World Cup in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
The devil will be competing tomorrow for the longitude and Mäkelä on Saturday for the trialogue.
However, the two coach, Ghazarya from Armenia, has not obtained a visa for the United Kingdom.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this issue in the British Embassy without success.
The coach has the invitation of the World Cup organisers as a document, but even that is not good enough to have a visa.
I wonder whether this is one of the first symptoms of Brexit, or what the coaching manager Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always in the past been successful in dealing with visa issues himself, but now there are some problems.
He will do everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Association SUL for years.
It is not that important.
As long as one looks at the signs in the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said about the possible absence of his coach.
World Medal from London takes a miracle
Today's World Championships start in London on Friday and last Sunday, 13 August, a little over a week.
Public sports, cross-country skiing and hockey are the kind of sport that Finnish dock athletes can be passionate about from one year to the next, whether or not there is success.
In the hearts of puppies, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other indicators.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes, from one prestigious competition to another, where the acquisition of experience is used to mature the athlete's performance to the level that the adult World Medal is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in Finland's small MM team, and there are no machine boys either.
The World Medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the attractiveness and surprise of sport is that miracles can also happen.
It draws the seat athletes to a television screen and glues them to watch the Games, even though the London medals are only decided at night because of the time difference.
During the last World Cup in 2015, Finland was awarded a bronze competition.
It was brought by the speaker Tero Lomäki.
The gentles are waiting for a long-winded medal even now, although the opposite is apparent from the recent results of his and other shippers, as well as the long-term qualifying period in last summer's footsteps.
Whatever the outcome of these games, Lomäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports champion.
Access to the final contest or the setting of a record for the other Finnish visitors is a good enough achievement.
Hope and faith in a realistic medal for Finnish athletics in the years to come will be a great success in the international prestige competitions for young people this summer.
Producing talent among young people and providing financial support for their work is more important than maintaining a small elite of representative athletes.
Success does not come instantaneously, but requires years of hard work and patience on the part of athletes, both in training and in training.
Finns can also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performance.
Hopefully, the London Games will go down in history as the games of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not as a result of terrorist intimidation or cowardly attacks, for example.
Enni Rukajärvi, secondly, in Copper's big hospitals - 'But it is a shame'.
The snowman Enni Rukajärvi is in the second big air contest in Colorado, the United States.
The Copper Mountain Copper has become the second place in the World Cup in Rukajärvi, the best in the world of big air.
The women's contest was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
The powder lake collected 147 points in the competition.
He tried to make a final smile at the caballerial 1080 for the first time in the Games, and it was very close to succeeding.
Good feeling and good feeling is now, but you'll find it annoying that the last jump didn't go pretty well.
From now on, I shall certainly try to do so again in the Games, Rukajärvi.
In big air, snowboarding jumps from the jump made for the species.
Viking Line's new high-speed ship quashed in Helsinki
The new Rapid Vessel FSTR, the shipping company Viking, is seriously behind schedule.
Pika was supposed to leave Helsinki to Tallinn at 6 p.m.
The ship was loading in eight countries.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
At least an hour and a half I have been waiting to get on the ship.
Now the queue is moving a little bit, at 7.30 p.m. the Estonian national, Johannes Rebane, who is waiting for a ship to enter the port of Helsinki.
Rebane thought that the new ship had become a technical fault.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought water bottles waiting in its cars to the ship.
Christa Grönlund, Viking's Communications Officer, says to IS that there was a technical fault.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed on the return trip to Tallinn for a couple of hours.
The ship was supposed to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 8.15 p.m.
42-metre specialised transport disrupts traffic on the Kuutostie on Thursday evening
Forty-two metres of specialised transport will travel from the Strait to the Black Port during the Thursday evening.
Transportation from nine should be completed by 11 o'clock in the evening.
The police are steering traffic on the Sixth Road and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
In the case of Mälkeen, transport is on the way to 13 ports in the Black Sea.
Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story simultaneously hails the celebrations of the 80s and the Grunge of the 90s (at that time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a wonderful The State sketch series for MTV) and their own time - 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series switched to their bigger careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant remembrance into which we have become stuck in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it already seems outdated.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not just out of absurd humour (it reported, among other things, the background to the vegetable purse speaking in H. Jon Benjamin's voice).
The essence of the Vits is that middle-aged actors act as covetous teenagers approaching adulthood, and highlighting this makes the impossibility of reaching the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults act as adults, is less well known, and its parody is more scattered: it parodies, for example, the Stalinist toys of the 1990s, such as the horror movie Hand every cradle.
At one point, one of the characters is digging up Apple Powerbook, the inline rollers and the 'other stuff from 1991'.
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Blessing Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has still not got over from Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And in one of the crazy ploys there is a member of Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) with George H. W. Bush (who is well-behaved by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best are the sideways.
It is especially fun to see the ancient young Paul Rudd, who is wearing a low-key placard, Matt Dillon's 'soul patch' film Singles. Andy, the camp's king, is beginning to be old days.
The moments of accidental madness may cause this series to take off as a sort of recursive Seven Up!untilit gets its apparent decision: Wet Hot American Summer - Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, the group of friends goes to the first evening of the Wet Hot American Summer film.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series, on the other hand, appeals to another kind of nostalgia: The America series to the spirit of the Cold War, the Atomic Blonde film and even the GLOW series, where the East meets the West.
The Komediasarja has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka by Rhys Thomas, a Romanian police drama in the 1980s, where a bukarestic clutch fights for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
In the capital, the hardline Gregorina and idealistic Iosefina are seen as Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their turn-words are dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It is a great idea,
but it is not much more than that.
There are some good visual jokes (policemen spend time watching chess on television in the same way as Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous audio actors involved, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
Comrade Detective, however, is too caught up in the tracking down of a clumsy socialist drama - involving, for example, a killer hiding behind the Reagan mask, which often starts to look really like clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humour of the series is neither fast nor rich enough.
To sum up, it might work better as an agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby, grasping hamburgers.
The message to the imagined communist public is that Western culture can turn everything into consumer goods and fast food.
The illusory Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we are cramming our own recent history and their history as well.
Toni Taurus from Kouvola will go up in Macao on Saturday against a former UFC match
Toni Taurus wants to keep the match standing.
In Macao, Toni Taurus will be faced with a hard bone, as the Brazilian Leandro Issa was still playing at UFC last year.
Brazil also has a jujute black belt and a world championship for the species.
For once, I take a stand against myself as a parent.
It's a funny story," says the 32-year-old Taurus.
The schoolboy had to climb into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three battles were quickly won in the autonomous region of Macao.
Taurus has not been affected by this in the past.
This was the first time that my match was cancelled.
It annoyed, because it took a lot of time to prepare and exercise.
However, the mathematician is pleased that the struggle has been given a new date.
Expectations for the week have little effect on preparation.
The transfer does not have any effect, as it does not improve in a week.
A municipality can get even worse if it is now practicing too much.
In the last few struggles, Taurus has met with opponents whose strengths lie in conquering.
This time the situation is different.
The Father Couvinist describes as a typical Brazilian.
He is a rather aggressive artist.
I suspect that he will be on top of the hard in the first instalment and try to export the carpet.
He has won the Championship of the World Championship, so he knows how to wrestle.
The previous match at school did not go according to plan.
The Philippine Kevin Belingon badly struck Tauru in the eye, and the victory was in the Philippines.
I have never performed so well, especially not with my feet: he didn't get any hits.
When I went down, he hit my eye.
It was a real shame for a long time.
New motivation
Some of the freekeepers ride once a year, while others get into the ring more frequently.
For example, the future opponent, Issa, last met in September.
The Taurus, on the other hand, had three matches last year.
Now we are facing the second battle this year.
Sometimes the pace has become heavy.
In recent years, I've been training and working in good condition all the time.
However, I have only cracked for a ride.
When the 32-year-old heard about the coming meeting, he decided to change the landscape for a while.
I was in Espoo training and got the joy of doing it back.
We got really good training when there was one guy in Sweden too.
The training was a great help, because on Saturday the Kosovar will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I have been able to work out the same size against opponents and practice a vertical match.
In fact, matching is the main activity of a 32-year-old.
You have to strike sensibly.
If there is an opportunity, I will of course go and take the land myself.
Sufficient information must not be given free of charge, as it is it that consumes the most.
Macao is attracting Taurus to China before.
It is said to be China's Las Vegas.
I think we have a big and wonderful evening ahead of us.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will maintain interest rates at a time when economic growth has been weak and the easing of inflation has put an end to speculation on interest rate increases.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow, and has shifted interest rates because of the increasing pressure on family incomes.
The decision-makers at the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee decided by 6 votes to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%. The interest rate received less support this month because of weak economic growth.
In its quarterly inflation survey, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that household incomes would be put under increasing pressure as inflation is expected to continue to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rate increases will be needed in the next few years to curb the inflation rate stimulated by Brexit, and the bank indicated that the cost of borrowing could have to be increased further than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the Commission decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package that began a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The bank will wind up the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide low-cost finance to banks through the programme to an additional £15 million, i.e. a total of £115 million.
The Bank's Protocol on interest rates states: 'The Monetary Commission forecasts that the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years as real household incomes decrease consumption'.
As regards interest rates, the Bank reiterated that in order to curb inflation, 'some tightening of monetary policy' would be necessary 'to a slightly wider extent'.
The market is currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and a second increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
In May, the Bank forecast an increase of 1.9% for this year and 1.7% for next year.
Today, it kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
The wood weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
In relation to the dollar, the pound was reduced by 0.5% to 1.31 dollars; in relation to the euro, it dropped by 0.4% and stood at EUR 1.11.
The decision to maintain interest rates was taken after weaker than expected growth rates dampened expectations of higher interest rates, which rose by 0.3% in the second quarter and by 0.2% in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation survey offered little hope to households suffering from rising inflation and low wage increases, and the Bank says that the situation will get even worse before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy could not "prevent" a decline in income in the coming years. However, it expects that wage developments will "substantially recover" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong increase in demand for British products as a result of the weakness of the pound sterling, which will cancel out part of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after interest rates were reduced to 0.25% after the shocked EU referendum result, which plunged the pound into decline.
The Bank estimates that the full impact of the decision is likely to start to be felt in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Prior to the most recent decision by the Central Bank, the demand for interest-rate increases had become even louder as inflation put pressure on households, and three decision-makers called in July for an increase in interest rates of 0.5%.
Inflation eased to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, but the Bank says it was expected and inflation will rise again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the excess over the target level of 2% was "entirely" due to the weakness of the pound sterling.
"In the light of the recent fall in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market would seem to be further intensified as lenders eagerly seek customers and want to end the year strongly," says Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan contract is coming to an end. Recruitment agreements are more popular, have low interest rates and have cost-free options available."
The NHS prescribes 10 000 controversial HIV drugs
From September onwards, patients can be ordered a 'epoch-making' anti-HIV drug. The Supreme Court brought to an end the dispute over the funding of this medicine in the British public health system (NHS).
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is prescribed for about 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. A pre-propagating medicine has been found to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86 per cent by high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld last year's Supreme Court ruling that the NHS is able to pay for the PrEP drug, even though it is claimed that it should be financed by local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was called 'significant new intervention' by Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS in England, and was described by the National AIDS Organisation as a 'crucial moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to receive enrolments for the experiment, which will be extended to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full extent in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure pre-prophylactic therapy (PrEP) is a pre-addictive HIV drug that reduces the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection in high risk groups.
Prior intercourse medicine means that there are enough drugs in the body during sexual intercourse to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The target group of treatment includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people with HIV-positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
Clinics select candidates who meet the conditions for the experiment from men, women and transgenders, as well as from those whose HIV positive partner is not known to be receiving anti-retroviral treatment for their illness.
People living in England and registered to be treated by a general doctor can also apply for experimentation in their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs £10 million, and this week the NHS signed a contract for medicines after an international tender.
The aim of the experiment is to assess the potential of the PrEP drug by gathering extensive clinical evidence on its targeting, taking and implementing the treatment.
"This major new intervention should complement and enhance the wide range of and increasingly effective measures already in place to prevent HIV," says Mr Stevens.
"This is another important achievement in the fight over more than 30 years to tackle one of the greatest health challenges facing mankind."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, Director of the National AIDS Organisation.
"If the PrEP medication is well targeted at those who need it and those who are at risk, it can have a transformative impact on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, those at risk will have access to medicine through an NHS-funded experiment, the use of which they can decide independently without the need to negotiate with a partner. It will have a powerful effect that will improve the lives of very many people.
This was welcome news."
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that no one at risk is excluded," says Ian Green, Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The tried-and-tested PrEP drug has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people at risk from HIV infection."
"The launch of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event that was unnecessarily prolonged for several months due to the government's slowness," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the shadow government.
"We have evidence that this medicine can have a transformative effect on our work to prevent HIV and to stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to gain a better understanding of the real benefits of the PrEP drug.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those who are exposed to HIV and bring them a step closer to halting the spread of HIV in society."
Quality of life: the intermediate layer and smart decoration solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
A former banker, Joanne Leigh, who is enthusiastic about renovating the properties, moved from the Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment at Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of the Royal Annan House. The success of the renovation is shown by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed his hairdressers and moved.
"Before this I lived with an ex in the Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to the apartment show and found that the rooms were as high as in my home at the time.
I started immediately and made an offer on the same day."
Since then, about 90 square houses have undergone a complete transformation.
It was a double bedroom where you could only get from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage room as well as an intermediate layer to make use of the height of the room.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
These were my demands," she says.
He hired a Duck & Shed Planning Office in Erfan Azadin Notting Hill. Erfa was commissioned to take advantage of nearly four metres of high rooms and create an apartment that would not just be a renovation and sale place but a home.
The height of the room was not quite enough to have two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate layer where it could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfa.
"Steel structures are quite complex.
The premises had to be arranged at the same time so that they did not have to be squabbled together.
The structures had to be adjusted so that the height was right for them and below."
Erfan was able to place two full-high rooms in a duplicate with fascinating details.
On the middle floor, a copper-cross window of Retrouvius opens to its elegant place of residence.
Impressive furniture, silver hostels and vintage lamps in Serge Mouillen create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatre, space to feel and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor look more than real.
The mirror that is immediately inside the kitchen is like a window that opens up a view in another room.
In the mirror-surface furniture of the entrance, Joanne maintains the space for meals and glasses.
The popularity is increased by the fact that the kitchen can be hidden when it is not used.
Kids on the doorstep are not a new solution,
but Joanne in the kitchen is unique in that the door is raised in the same way as the door of the garage.
"It took a bit of planning," Erfan says about the steel-filled MDF door.
"It is balanced, that is, it slips very easily when put in place."
With the rational use of space and the planning of storage status, Joanne received 16 extra squares, a second bedroom and a better basic solution.
"When you sell an apartment, the surface area decides - or the valuation of your property," says Erfan.
"In the basic case, the real estate agent will walk in to the apartment and calculate the price according to the surface area."
In Joanne's apartment, the surface area was increased using high-quality materials that bring a state of luxury.
"The resident is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotional connection to the apartment is partly based on them," says Erfan.
"There is no one who sticks to the electric wires on the walls.
They are also important, but not in the same way."
Joanne apartment is an example of the fact that good design and extra squares can make the basic apartment exceptionally fine.
Then you can no longer want to move away from the apartment.
Princess Sofia, who is pregnant, radiated in her summer house
In Prinse, the bird of Sofia hit the button.
In Prinse, Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before giving birth.
At the dinner of A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a lightweight dress for breath.
Sofia was a smile.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has been visiting Båstad this week.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia was represented at the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a magnificent blue body-work atmosphere, publishing with brilliance the last pregnant princess.
Sofia came to the event in a dark entity.
This is the last representative event in which Sofia will represent before birth.
His calculated time is September.
For dinner, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastellinist dress that landed brilliantly.
The style crowned the big ear jewellery and the elegant little bag.
Pastellinblue put nicely in princess.
Sofia has been on a representative trip to Båstad in Sweden this week.
Sofia replenished her life with a infant.
Sofia was actually radiating in its fresh summer lodge.
Sofia even started to chat with photographers at the event.
Now I just prolong my stomach, Sofia noted with laughter and referred to his final pregnancy.
He is bringing us up with a sweet chil.
In the summer of 1996 a stall appeared in Lahti market where Thai food was sold.
The Lawyers did not dare to taste; they walked past.
In the chain, the food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, amongst the familiar Panja.
He was unable to speak Finnish at that time, and the Finns did not know tha at that time.
Because the people did not dare to go and eat, Panja offered free taste.
This is how he taught the Baptists to eat thairuous, spring snake at a time.
From the countries, he said.
I was in a tight hook.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai groves at the Lahti Chamber of Commerce.
There were two small tables, I think there were fewer than 20 customer places.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but to sit next to a Russian guest.
When there is hunger and places limited, one cannot leave a empty chair between oneself and a stranger.
Little by little we got to know better and we became friends.
Finally, I sat at a plate with a dictionary to learn Thai.
Two years went into the shopping hall, but then the restaurant had to change, because the seasoned flavors were said to smell too much in the hall.
A new place was released at the end of the shopping hall.
There is space.
Now we, the jury, are allowed to sit back at our own tables, only in the most stressful times are we shy enough to ask the guests whether there is room next to us.
Panja knows her client.
He will be told what belongings have taken place and who has been seen.
He knows what food each eats.
He has seen different stages of life for clients and changes in the gastronomy.
He remembers with whom I went to eat my first spring serpent.
She remembers me as being fat and thin, and remembers what I was like when I was young.
It is nice to go for lunch a little later than others, to sit next to the door of the kitchen and to change belonging to the counter with the bullet.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
She has taught tolerance and internationalism with a sweet chilikastic.
He has opened up not only our tastes but also our thoughts and hearts.
Nowadays many speak to him about Thailand - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire the Pan.
Although he has also been difficult, he is always kind.
He is hard-working.
On top of the restaurant he goes to the mushroom and ink.
Last week, in the restaurant, two decades of fulfilment were celebrated surreptitiously.
We customers got strawberry cake for the dessert.
Without the noise or attention it took this great day, at work.
The discovery of the underground base revealed 173 ISIS terrorists who were ready to strike in Europe.
At the beginning of the year, the security authorities received a list of significance for the work carried out in the fight against terrorism.
The list includes more than 170 information from ISIS fighters who are ready to invade Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are 173 people and the document includes not only their personal data but also the images of each.
More than 130 of those on the list are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also included.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Ilta-Sanomat told about the list and a couple of weeks back up.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains have been specified.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi army special forces discovered a list of terrorists' personal data and pictures when examining the terrorist organisation's underground base in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence services evaluated the authenticity of the papers and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The underlying fear was that something big and serious would be planned in the western world by terrorists after the Fathers fell in the nearest East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all persons, but also their date of birth, invented titles and information about their country of origin.
Terrorist specificities have also been identified on the list.
For example, the German 27-year-old Sami J. on the list reads Abu Assid al-Almani, a German.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012, going first to Egypt, then to Libya and later via Turkey to Syria to join the ranks of Isis.
A suicide bomber has been written next to his photo as a special area.
There is no more precise information about the fate of a man.
Europe has left some 6 000 fighters in the ranks of Isis, whose fate is not certain.
Man trembled under the surface of Helsinki Tokoinranta
Based on interviews with the civil protection institution, the man had wanted to show that he was able to swim.
Even the extremes can save a drowning life.
On Thursday, in Tokoinranta in Helsinki, a person who was submerged in water was rescued.
According to Ville Estlander, the fire-fighter of the Helsinki Rescue Agency, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found under the water about 15 minutes after the notification.
He was found beneath the surface by the diver of the civil protection establishment," says Estlander.
The emergency services were notified after half a dozen in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to the primary care.
Estlander tells us that this was about a 50-year-old man.
Based on interviews, the man had wanted to show that he was able to swim.
The situation in Toulouse is already over.
Estlander commends the cooperation of the authorities with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Guard.
Local politicians also provided excellent guidance to divers.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued along with the Border Guard and the police.
Two cars collided in Eura - nine people in cars, three seriously injured
The cars had a total of nine people, the rest of whom suffered less severe injuries, says the on-call fire champion.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident took place at a crossroads of three roads at four o'clock a day.
The collision happened when another car turned to the alarm from behind to another car, tells the on-call fire champion.
According to the civil protection body, there is an 80 km/h speed limit in the crossing area.
Brothers fight for over $500 million in property
Two brothers argue about one of Victoria's biggest real estate investments, worth over $500 million, in connection with a family business set up by their Italian family 40 years ago.
The former president of the Carlton Football Association and the developer of the Real Estate, Colin De Lutis, lives in the Toorak Values just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken to the Supreme Court a dispute about the division of property and business property between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but there is a bitter dispute over the difference.
The brothers and their mother Anna together own 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars. The family began to accumulate property when they bought a trade on the Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans shop there, which expanded into a chain of 160 movements.
The trade chain was sold for USD 85 million in 1999.
The money was used for properties, and today the family owns offices, property development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, as well as apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centres in the suburbs.
According to the agreement with the deceased father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds of the assets of Paul about a third of the company. Paul describes his father as "the driving force and central character of the family."
According to legal documents, the distribution ratio of assets means that Colin owns real estate to the value of approximately 316 million dollars and Paul approximately 176 million dollars.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think that in his proposal Colin left the best real estate for himself," Paul wrote in his first doctoral testimony for the court in 2015.
Last Friday, for the first time, the case was heard by the Supreme Court, after several attempts at mediation.
Brothers are now also arguing about who is controlling the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
According to Colin, this is not the case; he accuses Paul of mismanagement of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first compelling testimonies that he would like to find a solution.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, the family is the most important thing for me," says Colin in his statement.
There are hundreds of pages of sweet statements, e-mails and reports. The case is being investigated by consultancy companies such as Deloitten, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the country's best and most experienced lawyers, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicacy shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a trade in Brunswick.
They were used as an insurance when the family was buying a property in Collingwood, for which Colin founded the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says that he founded the store "in the last years of the high school, while Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis tells that she and in 2012 the dead Luigi wanted to move the real estate to their boys in harmony.
"Luigi often said that he does not want the brothers to go to court," Anna writes in her statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business. According to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when leaving the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "bitter about the economic conditions of their departure."
Colin has had a low profile, despite being a former board member of the Australian Football League League and a best friend of the television star Eddie McGuire, according to this biography in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied; he said in his text message that it was not possible to comment on the matter because it was being dealt with by a court.
"It's very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag my family's name into the legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted us to quarrel like this."
On Friday, hope seemed to have died out.
"Our cases will be resolved in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
The new Trump Chief of Staff intends to limit the President's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to the Poltico newspaper, the new head of staff at the White House is going to limit media use and news monitoring by President Trump so that the boss does not get into so many difficulties.
The journalist Josh Dawsey reported:
"When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met with management staff on his first day in office, he raised a key problem that he is going to solve: he is going to limit President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told the White House's employees that all information - whether printed or heard at press conferences - must pass through him, because the President makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have also tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has a relationship to television for decades - and as President he is still watching a lot of television.
"If Mr Trump, the presidential candidate, got nervous about the unfair news, he was well advised to show that the sympathetic media dealt with things in a more even-handed way," Sam Nunberg, the adviser in the Trump campaign, told Politico in February.
Politico journalist Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "according to six former campaigners, it is essential to manage the use of Trump Twitter that his personal media flow includes a steady flow of praise."
Okay.
But it is ridiculous to claim that the use of Trump's Twitter has ever been under control.
Perhaps these campaigners know something that the rest of us do not know - perhaps the Trump twins would have been even more extraordinary without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages were not sent from Trump.
If his staff have been able to prevent him from causing problems even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been consistent in preventing Trump from causing the commotion.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House trying to push their case by providing Trump with information that supports their view; that information can be reliable - or it cannot be.
In May, Politico wrote that advisors deliberately give the president questionable information.
The journalist Shane Goldmacher reported on one case:
"The current and former employees of Trump say that he can become enormously exasperated by newspaper articles criticising him, especially when they report harmful information leaks, and then he is absolutely forced to know where the data came from.
This is what happened at the end of February when somebody misleadingly gave a copy to the President of the news on the GotNews.com website set up by Johnson, accusing the assistant chief of personnel, Katie Walshi, of several leaks from the White House.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter because of harassment, and had previously spread false accusations and subsequently withdrawn them. He did not provide any concrete evidence either.
Despite this, Trump had started the case after reading out the staff in question from Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Head of Staff, Reince Priebus, and Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary, had 'tried to introduce a management system for the files that go to Trump'.
And what was the result?
Kelly will try the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump will continue to have his own impulsive self and his assistants will continue to pursue their own affairs.
These unchanging facts make Mr Kelly's task very difficult.
Neymar signs a five-year agreement with PSG
Neymar, the Brazilian star, has signed a five-year contract with the French Football Club PSG, according to the AFP news agency.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar representatives had paid FC Barcelona, a football player in the Spanish league, an extraction price of EUR 222 million.
The Neymar Agreement with Barcelona had therefore been cancelled and he was free to move to the Paris club PSG.
The transfer of a staggering EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
In the past, the record was in Manchester United, which paid out EUR 105 million last summer from Paul Pogbas, a Frenchman.
Qatar Sports Investment is owned by PSG, a state-owned qatar company.
It is chaired by a former tennis professional, Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Successful writer Raija Oranen explained with a hypnosis of alcoholism and fear: "I am in my life's condition"
From the TVs to the Runny Age and the Clean White Forces, the famous success writer Raija Oranen has just celebrated his 69 birthday.
The hypnosis helped by Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren hold the grandmother so that, in addition to writing, Raija and his husband, Jyrki, gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola house after 18 winter.
First they sold their houses, but now in the spring they also left their rental apartment.
From the sun and light, away from the old circles Raijan took away the depression and alcoholism that he has survived.
The exterior is also 20 kg lighter.
The pressure went to fade away when serotonin medications were stopped, they were anti-depressants.
Alcoholism helped me in my time with hypnosis, which also appealed to the fear of flying, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes people, the radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been travelling the same way for more than 45 years.
I can do better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen, who also worked in the sector, has been travelling together for over 40 years.
I commanded, and it was married going in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That's the queen of drama he's always been, stopped living from that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who made an enormous literary career, remembers only the beautiful 44-part Clean white sheets on a TV series that touched and moved Finland during the Depression.
I closed the clothing industry once and for all to Raiva's family business when I was on a plane reading the 50-year interview with Liisa Seppälna.
I was the daughter of an ombudsman myself, my mother also had a clothes movement and I used to be a mannequin, Oranen remembers.
From him the plot of the series and the story changed the attitude of Finns to entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and dissertation revealed it, Oranen says.
Raja Oranen lives as a writer of active time, he has many manuscripts of work in progress - ideas of hundreds.
The Circular returned to the "millionaires' trail of a ditch."
The wealthiest householders in the West Midlands are once again at loggerheads with persistent travellers who managed to cross the municipality's much-needed pie and return to the fields adjacent to their houses.
Around twenty caravans are parked by citizens in a street called 'the millionaires' in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross a whale lackey that the municipality needed as a barrier to travel, bringing with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The circulars managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected by the path.
The distressed inhabitants have accused the Province of Solihull of 'being completely incapable of solving the problem'.
An anonymous resident tells us that the Travellers came from Bentley Heath on Monday evening, where they had cast bystanders by stones.
"The municipality must be punished for acting because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The Circles were here in May, then they left but returned.
There were more of them in the evening and probably even more today."
The resident told me that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by refusing access to the parks.
"I live in the Streetsbrook Road and it is frustrating to pay municipal taxes when a municipality cannot do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that travellers returned so soon after being expelled.
"There are more of them, and they have even put a horse on the grazing park."
According to a briefer in the municipality of Solihull, the municipality is aware of the illegal camping in the vicinity of the Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal steps with the Solihull police to expel the campers as soon as possible.
In order to gather evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report incidents of disturbing or criminal activity to the police.
It helps to form an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
The Portuguese peat machine was surrounded by irritated people.
In Portugal, men who carried out a forced landing on a beach full of people have been tried today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the forced landing.
The two men who flew the aircraft can be charged with death.
The longest it can receive in Portugal is a 16-year prison sentence.
A small plane flying for the men had to make a forced landing yesterday on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon because of a technical fault.
There were hundreds of people on the beach during the time of the incident, some of whom ran ashore planes to escape into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died instantly.
The machine first hit the man who had the back on the machine.
Immediately afterwards, the plane rose up and, when it landed again, it hit the head of the child, told Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias, who was on the beach.
The little girl who was grieving was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not injured.
On the beach, a small plane was surrounded immediately after the crash with anger.
The girl's father and other people went to the machine and started beating it, told Celia Rocha Correio da Manha, who had witnessed the incident.
The man called the pilot a criminal; he was desperate.
It is a miracle that no more people died.
The two men on board were not injured in a forced landing.
A Finn who tragically lost his foot won the MM gold once again: "Without an accident I would not be a world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated early Wednesday morning Finland's time as MM gold banked in slalom in the Canadian Big White competition.
In the past, Greater Hamari also won the cross World Gold.
There are now three World Championships in total.
Time for the incredible World Cup!
Two times was treated with gold, pretty good pulse pulled, the telephone-driven Greater Hamari cheered.
A 30-year-old calculator praised his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Greater Hamar, the number of challengers in the species is increasing all the time.
The whole paralysis has grown and developed very much lately.
The differences are getting smaller and there are a lot of new authors.
One always wonders whether there will be a black horse behind it.
Each race seems to have a different winner.
Greater Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
From a young age he had worked hard with his friends, and the accident did not cause him to go down.
It occurs to me from time to time that what my life would be like without that calamity.
But my attitude has always been that it is not worth it.
Those cards play which are divided, Greater Hamari emphasizes.
It would be a cruel joke to call a serious accident and the loss of a limb as a stroke of luck, and that is not what Greater Hamari is doing.
But he turned the awful difficulty to his advantage.
Yes, I would say it turned out to be a victory.
I would not be a three-fold world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the biggest ferry swing in Greater Hamar, aged 23, was already fading.
It was only after the accident that Duuni got off to the top.
At a young age, I trained with friends, and we were always excited to kill X-Games.
But they were distant dreams which dimmed somewhat over time.
After the accident I somehow found myself there in the X-Gamesi star.
I could not have imagined beforehand.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a very long life if I stayed here biting and mourning.
I chose to drag the piper down and start working.
I would say that I have been quite successful.
The calculator was very pleased with the choice of the wheelchair Leo-Pekka Star as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic winner received his prize in a sports hall in January.
According to Greater Hamar Star's victory is an important signal for the best sports.
It was really big, and the victory was definitely deserved.
This will certainly also open our eyes to the para-sports world.
When will it be time to launch the athlete campaign of the double-world champion Matti Suur-Hamar?
We will see that in due course.
I will try to do my best to succeed.
Even Greater Hamari has not conquered all the summits of his lusts.
Next year will set a big goal.
In a year's time there will be a Paralympic Games in South Korea.
Yes, they will go and fetch the medals!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their country permanently unless the war ends and Isis leave the country
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees are flying bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of young Syrians do not believe that they will return to their country permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Fathers from the country are the most important things that should happen in order for them to return to their country of origin.
The Trump regime does not see a change in the Syrian conflict.
The Burson-Marsteller communications chain explained the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international study.
For nine years Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of the Arab world.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
The survey was carried out between February and March 2017 by a total of 400 young Syrians aged between 18 and 24, half of whom are women and half men.
Half of the interviews took place in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their country of origin permanently in the future.
42% of respondents think they are returning to their country of origin and 4% are not able to say.
According to the study, the decision of young people to return home is most affected by the war in Syria and by the presence of the Father in the country.
Almost half (47%) see the end of the war as the most influential factor for permanent return to their homes, while a quarter consider the most important thing to be the departure of the Fathers from the country.
Less than a tenth of people raise the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria as the main factors contributing to the decision.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict
The young Syrians were asked what is the most important factor in ending the conflict.
The majority of people believe that an end to war is more essential than the relinquishment of President Bashar al-Assad.
More than a quarter of people regard the President of Al-Assad as an obstacle to a peace agreement.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the current conflict in Syria.
Just a quarter of the population believes in the resolution of the conflict through military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugee youths see the Father's power weakened in the last year, while a fifth see its power strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against Fathers, and terrorism in general, is that the media should convey to people information that the Fathers have nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many people have made military action and educational reform a priority.
Over a tenth of people think that the most important thing is to create better paid jobs for young people.
Asked about the impact of the Trump regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change under the Trump regime.
Almost one in four believes that the conflict in Syria will worsen during the Trump period.
Opinions are divided as to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the web in order - his data base is used by, for example, Wikipedia and Google
The Open Source Database is being developed by MariaDB, the "world's fastest growing" company.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by Coding Entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs users absolutely nothing and can be developed online by any eminent programmer.
Google and Wikipedia, for example, are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge volumes of information remain in order and are quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they will use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in the picture form comes from the database, and even the images are linked to it," explains Widenius.
Widenius, the technology driver of MariaDB, spends about half of its time coding.
A man who does something remote from the merchants to ensure that the Internet functions smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database, MySQL, together with David Axmark from Sweden.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and a year later, the software giant Oracle grudged Sun for 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle trade took place, a large number of the developers of MySQL announced that they would leave.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who didn't give a firm promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius remembers.
He had already, at this stage, set up a company that began to develop MariaDB.
He did not want his life's work to die.
I hired about 20 of the best developers from Sun and made sure that the continuity of the code was secured with the help of the same friends who created it.
As MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
The name just had to be changed.
A foundation was set up to monitor the freedom to develop the MariaDB code.
"During MySQL these assurances were not made," Widenius complains.
Although many have heard about Widen and MySQL's billion deal, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"In recent years, our growth has been around 50% per year," says Kenneth Paqvalé, the economist of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which is focused on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalé is a meagre word about the company's key figures.
To that extent, she reveals that in the current financial year MariaDB estimates that she will receive orders worth EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed around it services that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps with the exchange of databases, which can be a job for more than a year if the client has used a closed database.
The change from MySQL to MariaDB can be done overnight because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, Spanish operator Telefónica and DBS, the largest bank in South-East Asia, are paying customers in MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in Linux operating systems distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we are a small company, we have links to the biggest players.
"Among our clients are the world's largest telecoms operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks," Paqvalé List.
The information market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP in their closed databases.
For Oracle, too, MySQL is a modest side-business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although, according to the research company Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, players such as MariaDB are still negligible, albeit rapidly growing, seals.
In a database market of about $50 billion, open source databases do not reach even a billion.
However, the importance of open source coding cannot be measured only in monetary terms, as the majority of users do not pay anything for these software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies will develop more than 70% of their internal applications over open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would then have been exchanged for open, or at least the transition would have started.
Large companies will not get new customers, because most of them will now opt for open source.
As a result, licence fees on commercial databases have jumped into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as previously with a smaller number of customers," Mr Widenius ponders.
Due to the difficulty of switching a closed database, the majority of client companies have obediently swallowed up the price increases.
"There are a lot of customers for whom switching is really difficult because their old applications and others are caught in a closed database," Widenius says.
He still believes that the measure of customers is coming to its fullest.
When licence fees increase every year, the customer sooner or later moves to the open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent higher than before, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he so wishes.
Moreover, many companies are already facing major systemic changes as they transfer their operations to cloud computing.
At the same time, many people will exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million in loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has approximately 115 employees worldwide and is now to hire more.
One of the reasons for EIB funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in, for example, the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually from databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently," Paqvalé says.
Widen harms me, for example, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that open source is ideology, but I think that is a better way to do code.
The community helps and does something that is not invented or able to do by itself.
Widenius, 55 years old, is one of the best-known open source promoters along with Linux Torrüns, another Finnish developer.
Widenius helps other companies develop successful business models over open source.
I still make 4 to 5 speeches every year around the world on this subject.
Italy strengthens its stance on NGO rescue vessels
Italy has warned NGOs that are rescuing refugees on board its vessels in the Mediterranean Sea that they will not be allowed to continue their activities if they do not commit to complying with the new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not sign up to the new Code of Conduct, it's hard to see how they can continue to operate," said Marco Minniti, Minister of the Interior, in an interview with the Governor La Stampa.
The day after the Italian authorities had seized the ship of the German aid organisation Jugend Rettet, a crew whose crew is suspected of cooperating with smugglers who encouraged illegal immigration, the Minniti warning came.
Only a year ago, an aid organisation refused to comment on the detailed charges of the prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartoso.
"For us, saving lives is and will remain the most important thing. We very much regret that we are currently unable to act in a search and rescue area," declared the organisation in a statement published in the social media.
"We will only be able to assess the accusations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
The Iuventa vessel of the Jugend Rettet organisation had been monitored by the Italian authorities since October.
It is suspected that the crew, by boat, took in refugees directly from smugglers who were able to re-use the boats.
One such case is said to have taken place only a few kilometres from the Libyan coast, as can be seen from the prosecutor's document, the contents of which have been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian coastguard, which monitors rescue operations in the area, and the enthusiasm for assistance is hailed as a motive.
According to the code of conduct, vessels such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who monitors the activity.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to follow a code of conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
which stated on Thursday that it considered the new rules to be unnecessary but acceptable since they do not create 'significant changes or obstacles' to the organisation's rescue activities.
Among those who refused to comply with the code of conduct is the Nobel Prize winner, Médecins sans Frontières.
Minniti, for his part, said that rescue operations have led to a sharp fall in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks, which he sees as a sign that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coastguard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
"In the last few days, a light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the Minister said.
He revealed that there are plans to continue discussions this month with the mayors of Libya on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
The seasonal worker is suspected of killing his cousin Enontekilä, the suspect was found in the country - a case to the prosecutor
The suspected crime took place in the Kuwait of Enontekiö last December.
According to the police, a 36-year-old man from the Czech Republic is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish cohabiting partner.
It has been said in the past that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told that the suspect has fled with two dogs to the ground after his action.
The man was found cold in the ground and he did not resist when he was captured.
The case must be prosecuted within less than a week.
The case may still be heard in the district court of Lapland during the month of August.
Robert Hardy, who is renowned for Harry Potter and my all-time friend, has died.
The British actress, Robert Hardy, has died at the age of 91.
This family was informed on Thursday of the exhibitor's death.
In 1925, born Hardy began his career as an actor at 24 years of age in the theatre.
During his long career he also played in movies and on television.
Hardy will be remembered, in particular, for the role of the magistrate secretary, Cornelius Toffee, in Harry Potter films, and for his veterinary role in the television series 'My friends of all ages' based on the book of James Herriot.
The popular series on the BBC was filmed in total through seven channels.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to prison for text messages inciting suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and telephone calls that led her boyfriend to commit suicide at Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years on condition.
In June, Carter was convicted of death. Her boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
"My family has broken down," Conrad's father said at Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter applied for a change to the judgment and waited for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was threatened with a sentence of 20 years but, according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffer from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured bag, was listening to her verdict with her hands crossed and an eastern look on the ground created.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He decided Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken any responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He has not shown remorse."
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was caused by 'shocking circumstances, which Carter deeply regrets'.
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz took the view that Carter's "age or maturity level and even mental health problems did not have a significant impact on her actions."
The prosecutor read the statement by Lynn Roy, the mother of Conrad, saying, "Not a day passes without mourning the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I get out of all this. I will do my best to comfort his sister in the pain we will always bear."
Conrad's sister Camdyn Roy told the court that he was being 'persecuted' by the thought that he would never see his brother's wedding and would not be a aunt for his children.
"It's painful to lose a person who has been in my life every day since I was born. It's a pain you'll never let go of," Camdyn said.
This case seems to set a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in the car in 2014.
The incident caused national attention when it turned out that Carter had incited her boyfriend to commit suicide in her text messages.
"Hirt yourself, jump from the roof, stab yourself. I don't know the ways there are many," Carter wrote in many messages that she had sent to Roy during the two weeks preceding this death. Roy was then on holiday with his family.
Just a little before the Roy suicide Carter wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start a generator, and you are free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter applied for attention at the death of Roy. The judge ruled that Carter may not profit from the incident by giving interviews.
The case has divided the experts' opinions.
Few have defended Carter; one of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of a British fellow in Italy in 2007 and was released two years later.
Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion document, in which he states: 'Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison'.
NATO Secretary-General: Mid to Russia worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think one can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped to be able to seek close cooperation with Russia.
But, especially since the illegal annexation of the Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability in the territory of eastern Ukraine caused by Russia, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO remains committed to ensuring that tensions do not peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to have a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid an escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Mr Stoltenberg made his comments, US President Donald Trump was able to say that relations between the USA and Russia had reached a dangerous low point.
Mr Trump called for a 'thank you' to Congress, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
Audi makes changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to a setback suffered by car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement BMW offered to update the more than 350,000 car software.
The BMW director said that the company believes that 'there are more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions', referring to European cities, including the home city of BMW in Munich, which are considering limiting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that he would make changes to engines of more than 3 million Mercedes in order to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies talked about calling back.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to achieve CO2 emission targets.
Emissions of nitrogen oxides from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
Emissions from installation costs of neutral equipment will rise, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are under strict surveillance, and Chancellor Merkel has been accused of indulging the big car companies and ignoring the problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed scam equipment in cars that reduced emissions to the regulations in the tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former director of the Audi motor development department, who was responsible for thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
Mr Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, and the authorities suspected that Audi had installed in its cars a system capable of circumventing European emission standards, based on a similar study in the United States.
The Audi investigation may significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the producer of luxury benefits makes a disproportionate contribution to Volkswagen's profits.
The Venezuelan vote started a fraud investigation, with big demonstrations in the offing.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of real voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion of the firm, which has no role in the election result, Tibisay Lucenan, Chairman of the National Election Commission, said to the journalists.
Maduro assures us that the crisis will end
On Sunday, in a controversial vote in Venezuela, a delegation was elected to amend the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against its change.
The opposition to this country has postponed its own demonstrations so that they can take place at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais, the national security forces in the country began to occupy a local parliament building on Wednesday evening.
The purpose of the force is to ensure the security of the nomination event.
Climate change threatens Provence's lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region in the south of France, but it is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender had decreased due to drought and infectious insects, and scientists and farmers are busy trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is positively endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years. As a result, the rainfall in the spring, and especially in the autumn, has decreased significantly," says Eric Chaisse, expert at Provence, CRIEPPAM, an agricultural research institute.
"This shortens the lifetime of the lavender.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small bags to the area, spreading micro-bacteria."
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil is attractive to tourists and is also highly desirable as an ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of long stars and big flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed, impaired or absent," says Chaisse.
"In other words, there will be less oil-containing material than before."
The solution lies in more efficient irrigation, slowing down soil moisture evaporation and spraying plants with a protective mixture of smoke and water, as well as better development of drought-resistant varieties.
The murder of a journalist reflects the growing threat in Mexico
The editorial of the once a week's edition of the Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the most recent cases relating to organised crime, corrupt authorities and the endless war on drugs in the State of Sinaloa are handled.
Today, however, we are discussing security in the light of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been asked to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: to leave the children at home or to involve them in the editorial that was carried out by a grenade attack in 2009.
The front of the room has been marked by three words written by safety experts: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists for names in each group. No evidence is needed, the observations and feelings are sufficient.
On the table are the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on the government's or drug cartels' payroll, criminals who make the chaos in Mexico life-threatening.
Violence is continuous, and journalists are increasingly being targeted, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, journalist and source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a supplier," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is sorely missed, even though he is everywhere present. The façade of the Riodoce building is covered by a huge picture, with Valdez displaying the middle finger. It reads: 'Justice', and three journalists, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, are wearing T-shirts with the smiling face of Valdez.
The meeting is held less than two months after the death of Valdez. Journalists discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
In 2010, a federal public prosecutor's office was created, in particular for the treatment of journalists' cases, but, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two prosecutions have so far been brought.
The murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice, just as, of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, very few are brought to justice.
Riodoce journalists intend to continue writing about the violence in Sinalo, even though they have been murdered by grief and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, there is little point in having a security meeting because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is frankly a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the cause of the incident."
Valdez had left the office of Riodoce in the State capital, Culiacan, in the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had travelled to the Red Toyota with only a couple of blocks, when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots, presumably linked to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means the twelve rivers.
The shooter drove off the Valdez by car and knocked it off a distance.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left to mourn for a wife and two adult children.
Rumours move quickly and freely in Culiacan.
However, we are still silent on the death of Valdez.
Sinaloa has been one of Mexico's bloodiest battlefields since Guzman was arrested last year and expelled to the United States in January, and rival factions want to fill the vacuum.
In the streets of Sinalo, one or several people are shot dead every day, and in the cemetery there are two-layer decorative graveyards of drug barons that are larger than many homes.
A coastal state is "peaceful" when only one cartel dominates ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and leader of Riodoce, Ismail Bojorquez, aged 60, feels guilty of failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, leading a rival faction fighting a war against the sons of Guzman.
Mr Guzman's boys may have been annoyed by the story: every number was bought by suspected members of the gang as soon as the magazine came to the point of sale.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published the same story was attacked.
Mr Valdez was legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is regarded as a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up five colleagues with Riodoce. Lehden shares were sold at that time for $50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to make journalism without addressing the drug problem," explains Bojorquez.
Over time, the magazine started to feel bold and honest about its stuff, and its sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing top-class investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by articles in the newspaper that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its creation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for his news in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the Journalists' Protection Committee's International Press Freedom Prize for its courage to follow the Mexican narcotics trade saga relentlessly.
He openly admitted that he feared.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said when he received the prize from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
Drug trafficking is a 'way of life' in Sinaloa. Valdez said Rompeviento in an interview on TV last October.
"A journalist must take on the role he has to play - or look stupid.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was being sown here - why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
The staff of Riodoce are longing for Valdez - a joker who is swearing like a harbour worker - and they are looking for a friend who has always been hugged and given advice; they are looking for a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routines.
He always wore pancreas.
She went to the opposite end of the delivery bar in El Guayabo and was always sitting at the same table.
Now they ask if the routines fell to his fate.
The death of a colleague has also led them to reflect on how best they can do their job and survive.
"Criminals don't like it if we deal in our cases with their women and children and their clean businesses, their secret thank-lines for drug trafficking.
They were left out of the story," says Bojorquez.
This meant, at best, strong self-censorship and self-protection,
to trust in your own instincts.
If you feel that everything is not right, you should stay away.
The problem is that, according to Riodoce journalist Andres VillarRea, 'the impression can be deceived, and that is what happened in the Javier case'.
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive trafficking routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to enter the room where Riodoce security training was being held. A few days earlier, it had become apparent that only spyware sold to governments had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two policemen had sought protection from a 40 degree pearl in the shadow of a tree.
The state government had ordered them to guard the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a four-storey building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some of the journalists woke up half-jokingly whether these two police officers were among the 50% that the governor of the state did not believe was reliable.
It has been months since journalists visited the mountainous countryside controlled by drug gangs.
This week's edition of Riodoce planned three main things.
The boxing greatness of Julio Cesar Chavez's brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The magazine was also going to reveal that the government's spending was concentrated in the Governor's home town.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block away from the public prosecutor's office, was a kidnapped group of people.
There was no official information about who was kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed cautiously: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular both with drug dealers and with the authorities.
The journalist found in public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the governing institutional revolutionary party (PRI), which has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about previous cases in the same place. In one of them, the son of El Chapo Guzman managed to escape and avoid military raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they were receiving reliable information from the Valdez column on the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has received a nickname for his body structure, El Flaco, Ohukainen.
"Now all links to our sources of information are broken."
Mr Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse which maintains signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists, and the Lehne workers have been given a new, unexpected task: they have become press freedom activists.
The journalist, Miriam Ramirez, took a few signs with him when he left for a demonstration next morning in front of the local public prosecutor's office, following another murder of a journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the Valdez murder.
After the disappearance a burned body was found which, according to the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest louder throughout the country, and the 'SOS Press' texts appear in demonstrations on pavements and buildings.
Today, Mr Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to obtain international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
The day after the Valdez murder, Ramirez met the Governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked for him to be removed from government affairs because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in his anger.
Mr Valdez had repeatedly stated that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, criminal authorities and a society that is indifferent.
In its last remaining book, Narkojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the behest of politicians and security forces, in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Articulo 19 Monitoring Group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were perpetrated by the police and the authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murders have a crippling effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the north of the border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was marked by a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I am here for the sake of my writings."
Next to his cut-off head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to close, such as the El Norte newspaper in the border state of Chihuahua in the north, after the murder of Miroslava Breach in March.
Some are continuing their activities, such as that of Mr Laredon El Manana, whose leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published on his front page a message to the drug cartels: 'What do you want from us?'
Some journalists have fled their Länder or entire country.
It is a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find a job on the ground, and you have to be on guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals look for a journalist, as apparently happened to the photographer Ruben Espinos, who was murdered with four women in a apartment in Mexico City in 2015, three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra - who was supposed to be a poet at the time - admits that writing about the drugs trade is scary.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, on Friday at midnight, the Riodoce journalists sat in front of the delivery with a paved beer when the newest number of the magazine had been completed. Suddenly, their telephones started to color the message.
In a shooting match between rival gangs and security forces at a seaside resort in Mazatlan 19 people died.
The war intensified, as promised in the cartel messages found in the region.
Journalists put the news on the Riodoce website with their pedestrian smartphones.
The front page had to be reset the next day.
Sirenes flourish nearby - another shooting.
Bojorquez looked at policemen to oversee the delivery:
if they were afraid, they covered it very well.
The delivery of Riodoce continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the newspaper under this massive portrait, where the man displays the central finger on the whole of Sinaloa.
Mr Bojorquez says that you cannot even contemplate stopping the activities. "How could I close a newspaper when our trainee asked to get to the street to do a case on the very day that Javier was murdered?"
The Hannu Mannise Olympics Project started with a huge setback - "Hard place"
In April, the celebrations of the 39-year-old Hannu Mannise were short, as a professional pilot began to prepare for the Olympic season.
However, the training period started catastrophically when Manninen became ill with the flu.
That was the beginning of a long period of ill health that lasted almost five weeks.
May went practically entirely while ill.
First there was the flu and finally there was a paediatric infection like an ear infection that I had to eat for an antibiotic course.
I was able to make only 10% of the planned exercises.
I do not remember when I was last painful for so long.
It was a tough place for me not to be able to take advantage of the training enthusiasm," Manninen says to Ilta-Sanom.
The test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion only received a training permit during the second week of June, which was reflected in the KIHU wheelchair test on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skies on rolled carpet, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After each three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes the athlete's finger at the needle for a lactic acid sample.
Last autumn I was on the mat for 32 minutes, but now I have only 28 minutes.
Fire against the wall," Manninen says.
For the better
After the initial difficulties Manninen tells us that he has been healthy.
I have conducted a wide range of peaceful aerobic exercises to try to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now we have a really good five-week period behind us.
There was also a one and a half week holiday at the plane.
I was also able to go to the cottage with my family.
Last season, Manninen took part in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup home.
The best result was seen immediately in the opening competition, when Manninen climbed the eighteenth.
Guidelines withdrawn
The chief coach of the manninen and the national team, Petter Kukkonen, has carried out an exercise and competition plan for the period up to next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm for traineeships compared to the previous period.
After the first snow games, Ruka would have the weekend of the three World Cup tournaments.
In December, at least one of the weekend of the World Cup, perhaps Ramsaussa, would be involved.
At the end of January, the plans would have to be included in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that the name will be found on the Olympic team's list," Manninen says.
The Olympics in Pyeongchang would be the sixth Winter Olympics in a career for Mannise.
The most important thing now is to remain healthy, the numerical underscore that marked the gold contest in Salt Lake City in 2002.
Dinosaurus covered up its enemies by dressing up
At first it looks like a frightening statue.
Now the scientists have revealed the first results of research on a species the size of the horn found by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that the experts call it Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It had remained so well that scientists could even define that its Finnish skin was red and had had a "problematic past."
According to Current Biology, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in history and the best of its species in the world.
The recently discovered fossil is a nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the chamber season between 110 and 112 million years ago.
Scientists regard this remarkably well-preserved fossil as a truly remarkable discovery.
According to the National Geographic , the armoured vegetarian is the most preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in Northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to examine his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
There, 1 100 kilograms of salmon were mined for six years.
The results of hard work are now visible.
"If you chip your eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping," says the scientist Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrell.
"It will go down in the history of science as the dinosaurs Mona Lisana, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Nadaughter's research showed that the dinosaurs eating meat were probably a major threat to this vegetarian, even though it had a tank and resembled a walking tank.
Its red and white armour disguised its predators and was also protected by darker and underneath colouring, which still exists in many animals.
According to the experts, it was thus better able to blend with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The nodosaurus, which was 110 million years old, made headlines in May and is now on display in the Royal Palaeontological Museum of the Tyrrell.
The scientists have named it Borealope Markmitchell, according to Mark Mitchell, a museum technician. Mitchell was part of a team that took over 7 000 hours of digging dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so surprisingly well that Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to determine its body's scales and armour patterns and shape.
They found that it was still protected by a general colouring in the animal world, where the body is darker on top and less bright below.
The observation was still a surprise, because Borealope is much larger than the current animals with a similar colouring.
It can be inferred that it was captured by dinosaurs eating meat to such an extent that evolution favoured hiding instead of fighting as a means of survival.
The current animals, such as pegs, seraphim and armadillos, have the same colour, they are much smaller and therefore easier to catch, which suggests that there was also a serious threat to the nodos.
"The catch of a large, heavily armoured dinosaur tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs of the chalk season were," says Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds from the Nodosaurus reveals that its leather was red leather.
Scientists are continuing their research on nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions from its life. They are studying, among other things, the contents of its bowel in order to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that when they died it fell into the river and went into the sea, where it sunk on the seabed.
At that time Alberta was as warm as it is today in Florida, and the rivers and seas probably went much further than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is truly significant because its Finnish leather has been preserved and has also survived three-dimensionally in its original form," says Brown.
"Therefore, it looks almost the same as in the early chamber season
To figure it out requires little imagination: if you chip a little eyes, one can almost believe that it was sleeping."
The association period was the era of teropodie, the vast two-footed dinosaurs eating meat.
Though their king, the Tyrannosaurus rex, lived for millions of years from Borealope before, its mighty predecessors may have prevailed over this armoured dinosaur.
For example, Acrocanthosaurus, a sixteen monster about 11.5 metres long, was the predecessor of the Tyrannosaurus rex.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in the Current Biology magazine, believing that Borealope was washed into the sea after his death and mutilated.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in Northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, from the spawning of leather and tank to the hip.
On average, the damage was five metres long and weighted up to 1 300 kilograms.
Two half-metres of spikes rose from their shoulders.
Scientists believe that this armoured vegetarian went through the current West Canada until the flooded river carried it to the high seas.
Its tank has been preserved down to the last detail in the underground grave.
Its fossilized remains are so well preserved that its leather remains in the tank's bumper discs along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic that such preservation is "as rare as a lottery win."
The more you look at it, the more astonishing it seems.
Its skull sawmill-rich discs still contain phosphated leather.
Its right foot is in its side, five toes up.
I can also calculate the scales of its foot base."
How did an activist learn to answer the question: to whom do the streets belong?
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked.
He had arrived the day before in New York from his home in St. Louis and sat on the bed of his airbnb apartment browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed the message from his reader:
"A young 18-year-old man has just been killed by the police, and his body is still on the street."
She was embarrassed to discover that no one else had posted the same information in her bait. Therefore, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous re-twisting exercises from the user @TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to St. Louis, who was twinning in real time about the death of Michael Brown, a black-skin Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old man, had been shot by the white police in Ferguson, in Missouri.
This user had also posted the image of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter later that evening, he was told that people would gather in Canfield Drive.
The users posted pictures of police repression and shouting people, as well as of a man who claimed to be the father of Brown, who said in his village: 'My unarmed son has just been killed by the Ferguson police!'
Mr Ferrell followed a real-time video photo where the police stood in front of the demonstrators with a barking dog.
He says that he also saw a video where another policeman shook his rifle and cried, "I kill you all... the animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers.
"It was not the kind of murder we are already used to and could be called typical.
At that time I felt cold colours.
I was angry and I wept."
He reserved a return flight for the next day.
Ferrell went to his six-year-old daughter's father and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
From what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next almost three years, a documentary film called 'Whose Streets' has been produced.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, as well as strength and perseverance from the point of view of the local people who took to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with his daughter dressed in a flower chamber and compatible with it, they had a discussion again about 'what it is like to live in black skin and under what conditions?' They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers that he said to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't help but have a daughter with me," Ferrell said later.
"Today's events are the culmination of events in the past.
My daughter has the right to know and to grow up in it.
He must acquire the capacity for activism and organisation, but he must also know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of black-skinned living, and he must know what we need to do to be freed, to be free of ourselves.
Although, fortunately, I have been able to protect her from blatant racism, she is still the same as other black girls.
I feel I would hurt him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop at Ferguson was the South Florissant Road, situated opposite the police station, which became a campsite for activists waiting to find out about the case and finally found out that there would be no prosecution against the police.
From there Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunch in bags and distributed it to the demonstrators.
Ferrell began to take a new approach to activism.
"The Aktivismini changed completely after 9 August," he explains. When studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was chairman of the Association of Minority Teachers. At that time, he focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience of organization.
Somehow it just happened."
A week later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the documentary assistant director, at the evening address.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar 'wanted to simply tell you what was happening'.
Ferrell was reminded of a doubt. He asked: "Do you really want to tell us what is happening, or do you want a story that you can exploit?"
The suspicion was caused by the countless instances of people appearing in the local community, usually white, who wanted only to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and bred in Ferguson had no common voice," said Folayan in an interview recently. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted the deputy director, Damon Davis, known for his activism with prisoners on death row.
The presence of Davis led Ferrell to join the project together with six other locals. The team followed events during the years following the shooting of Brown.
"This is not a document that someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we're talking about," says Davis.
"The most important thing for me was how the local people were shown in the film, because I'm presented in the same way."
According to Mr Folayan, the intention was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell, who wanted to show that the popular movement 'is not a charismatic leader, but a community', but Ferrell proved to be the most open.
That's why the documentary sees surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughed when she told me how it felt to see the film for the first time.
"But I understood that this work and the human depiction of black people require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story time and again places the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement at the centre.
The movement was created on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police shot a black teenager at Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with the queer identity.
"The leadership of the Black queer women has kept the whole movement going," says Ferrell. "This is because we are constantly having to fight on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure it all."
Folayan agrees: 'It is true that black women, among whom are many queer women, maintain mobility.'
However, he points out that Ferrell was not chosen for documentation as an "end in itself" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," says Folayan.
"It's no coincidence, however, that she was in the front line. Black queer women live at the cutting point of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy will be delivered from the screen."
Newspapers photographers have been submitting Mr Ferguson for a long time, but relations between the Community and the police are still tense.
Mr Ferrell still has two and a half years to stand and was sentenced for blocking the motorway during a demonstration.
His description of the socio-political atmosphere of his comrades-in-law is brief and to the point: 'Confusion'.
Yet he still relies on the slogan which he learnt from the exterior of Ferguson's streets three years ago:
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains."
Suitable integration: the artist creates portraits of DNA of Chelsea Manning
The Fridman gallery in New York has hung faces in the middle of the exhibition space - white, black and brown faces, where, if you look more closely, you can see unity.
These 30 works are portraits made by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on the Chelsea Manning pose and DNA samples of hair.
Manning sent samples of Fort Leavenworth's prison, where he served his 35-year sentence, for leaking classified diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks.
The exhibition Dewey-Hagborg A Becoming Resemblance was opened on 2 August 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in its work. Manning is a transient and pioneering dissident, sentenced to prison by Barack Obama on the third day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analysed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his gene data. They are a sharp, albeit somewhat theoretical, statement of the editorial completeness, ambiguity and interpretation of the underlying cause-effect relationships and identity.
Chelsea Manning, whose birth is Bradley Edward, has openly stated that he has identified himself with women since the time of puberty, and in 2013 he was found guilty of 20 crimes, including espionage offences, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one image of Manning, sentenced in prison: a lucid, black and white selves, in which Manning, having taken the trouble, is sitting on the driver's seat, and he has a platinhaler on his head, which became his distinguishing mark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had behind him the Stranger Visions project, which he carried out in 2012.
He created portraits on the basis of forensic data, for example on cigarette blacks and chewing numbers, and created images of how the people concerned could have looked.
The artist then received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their story," Dewey-Hagborg told a new exhibition at a press conference.
Manning could not be visited and could not be photographed in prison. So the magazine contacted Chelsea and asked if he was interested in making Manning a DNA portrait.
The artist and the rest of his incarceration suddenly became correspondents, who wrote to each other for a couple of years.
Together they even produced a Suppressed Images cartoon characterized by Shoili Kanungo, which described the future in which the President would have commuted the Chelsea judgment and would have been able to see the exhibition.
In reality, just a few days after the publication of the comics book, Obama shortened the Manning sentence, a fortunate coincidence after seven hard years in a Commonwealth Military Prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened at the very moment when Donald Trump is waging his own war against information-spinners and transgender soldiers and is coming up with new ways on Twitter of consolidating the powerful divisions that he actually had to mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that 'everything has meaning'.
On the wall of the gallery there is an artist's statement and under it Manning's great signature, where the point of the last name is the heart. In his opinion, the artist calls for an end to the 'automatic division on which sex, race, sexuality and culture are based'.
There is a parallel wall with the Manning DNA section: a long queue of C, G and A letters with a pencil.
By this combination of 200 letters - or nucleotides, as the scientific definition used by the artist is - Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are all, at least from our biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people to understand that we are equal in our genetic heritage and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretation," says Dewey-Hagborg. His Spurious Memories video from 2007 will also be displayed.
"DNA tells countless stories. 30 of them are displayed here."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: page from the Manning and Dewey-Hagborg comic strip.
In it, the Manning character climbs out of prison like King Kong, with a megafoni in his hand.
"If they can silence you, they will have won," says the picture.
"Never remain silent."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold colors."
Contrary to what the comic strip depicted, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning comes, he was greeted by his own genetic knowledge-based face as a group of demonstrators in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is purposeful, like everything else in this exhibition: For example, the manning DNA section is written in pencil to the height equal to his length (157.5 cm).
"The faces were on the wall before, but I wanted to bring a multitude of people to feel like that," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to describe the mass movement that Chelsea gave birth to, which was also behind his release."
Search for professor at Northwestern University and Oxford University in suspected murder
The police report that they have launched national searches to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University, suspected of stabbing a man to death in a chica luxury station.
The Cook District Court documents reveal that arrest warrants were issued on Monday for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, orders for first-instance murder without the possibility of bail being released.
According to the papers Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to local figures published by the Chicago Police Service, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
Police officers who were alerted to the Grand Plaza building found a victim who had several cut injuries in his body.
The police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has been an assistant professor of microbial and immunology at the University of Nortwestern since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-Chancellor of the University for Social Relations, said in an e-mail opinion that Lathem is now in administrative freedom and is denied access to the Northwestern University campus.
"This is a criminal case that the authorities are investigating, and the Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
The opinion sent by the University and Somerville College's spokesperson, by e-mail, states that "we have been in contact with the police in Great Britain and are ready to help the authorities investigating the case in the United States in any way possible."
In addition, the statement said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief of Information at the Chicago Police Service, said he would seriously urge suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and we are constantly clarifying our searches," Mr Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects.
He reported that the police had received a call from the host of the Grand Plaza building, who had received an indefinite hint that something had happened in the apartment in 1008.
The police described the scene as terrible.
According to Mr Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim had been murdered on the same day or in the past.
He reported that the security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," says Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza management team released the following information to the residents: 'The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence.'
Man threatened to blow up the Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic," convicted the police said.
Moffatt must perform a hundred hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced for his threats to blow up the Islamic bookstore in London and 'kill all Muslims'.
According to Independent, David Moffatt was convicted, among other things, of gross harassment.
According to the police, they were alerted by the book trade staff on 23 May.
According to the staff, the man had threatened to "blow up the bookshop and kill the Muslims."
The suspect left after the threats.
The Moffatt was caught when he called the police for intimidation.
Threats were not connected with the book trade.
The authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same outfit as a bookshop suspect, the police spokesman said.
I am not an anti-Muslim, I am a Catholic, Moffatt said to the police during interrogations.
The punishment for this man is to carry out a hundred hours of unpaid social service and to pay the legal costs of £620, or approximately £690, and £85, or about £95, to the victims.
Scotland Yard's spokesman says that a number of hate crimes are not reported.
"We are completing WADA's road map in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russia's Deputy Prime Minister, Vitaly Mutko, has said that Russia will soon complete its efforts in accordance with the World Anti-Doping Agency's WADA road map to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission (RU).
"Some of the measures in the roadmap have already been taken and the RUSADA was given the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Commission (UKAD).
WADA's road map has been updated to this extent," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for the restoration of powers to the RU. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to the poll, it contains nothing that is worrying for Russia.
"Everything has been announced and it's all being implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future."
One of the points in the road map, however, requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly approve the findings of a study by Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer, ordered by WADA, who is investigating the alleged role played by the state in doping Russian sport.
To that, Mr Mutko said: 'The inquiry is under way because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes, and we cannot grant what did not exist."
Mr Mutko's words echoed the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of Russia's independent public anti-doping commission.
"We have said several times that there are controversial positions and provisions in the report.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered the RU to end its doping control in Russia in November 2015, when the extent of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, it was authorised last June to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, WADA's Director-General, Olivier Niggli, visited the headquarters of the RU in Moscow. After the visit, he stated that the organisation was "on the right path" towards the restoration of its powers.
British organisation sceptical about the innovation cherished by Finns: Health benefits of maternity packaging "not proven"
The British organisation questions the benefits of maternity benefits for Finnish women.
BBC and Guardian, among others, tell us that the Lullaby Trust, which fights cot deaths, prohibits the use of its own brochures on maternity packaging distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will start this month in Scotland.
In England too, packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trusti, there is no evidence that maternity packaging reduces the risk of cot death.
Sudden death is the unexplained sudden death of the baby.
The Lullaby Trust is an expert on the child's safe sleep.
We no longer allow our official brochures to be packed into them, because that would suggest that we recommend this product, the organization informed.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, only two deaths per 1 000 births.
According to Lullaby Trusti, the good reading in Finland is the result of many different reasons, such as the small number of teenage pregnancies.
The fact that every family is given a box there may be one factor.
But that cannot be said with any certainty," said Francine Bates, Chief Executive Officer of Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packages are being marketed as products that reduce child mortality and cot deaths.
Maternity packaging is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers free of charge in Finland for 80 years.
The package includes various items such as children's clothing.
This year, 53 products are on the package.
The package itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all the safety standards.
On the other hand, Lullaby Trust says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a place of sleep.
According to Lullaby Trustin, a packaging can be the best option for a place of bed if there is no body or cot available.
The organisation recommends that you only use the package for daytime sleep and stop using it when the child is able to turn.
The organisation also recommends to keep pets away from the packaging and to ensure that it is not irrigated or filled with dirt.
The Japanese zoo was once again ruined by a vicious villain.
The Japanese zoo staff are looking for a carnation turtle.
The giant slave driver has surprised the staff at his speed and has already slipped into two weeks for the second time.
The competition ran from Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, in western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
The security barracks revealed that the villain left the zoo via the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, says Yoshimi Yamane, who works in the zoo.
The cultivated 35-year-old villa is half the female, 55-kilogram and about one metre long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as silent and gentle.
In the opening hours, the villain is allowed to move freely in the safest area.
The zoo has not received eye arrests from the turtle.
The previous fugitives took place the week before.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 metres from the zoo.
I saw that on my way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your company to avoid Uber's errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure workers' satisfaction with the e-commerce startup, but the questionnaires did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured us that the enquiries were anonymous, some workers were sceptical.
"The polls were simply not consistent or objective," says Errett, whose hair care company Madison Reed focuses on the online shop. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to rely on outside help.
New kinds of human resource management start-ups have come onto the market to help other companies find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement; companies can conduct enquiries and target them at specific teams and population groups, as well as provide their employees with anonymous notification services and, in some cases, direct contact over top management to the government.
"You can monitor your own health with applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is the Fitbit of companies?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of the Glint-startup in Redwood City, to provide analytic software for companies to measure their employees" commitment.
Errett has been using the Glinti software for three years. He says he has got a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program can carry out quick enquiries and votes for certain teams, and it can create a map showing at a glance which sections of the employees are most dissatisfied with and which of the directors have received the weakest assessments, which have enabled Mr Errett to get to the heart of the problems.
Businesses have realised that they need to follow a workplace culture so that they do not become the next Uberia. Since a former employee wrote in his blog about a culture in which employees are harassed and those who speak about problems are punished, there has been a stir around the transport company.
For startups like Glinti, such neglect is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry whose value, according to the Let's Talk Payments website, could reach more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent in Denver, Colorado State, is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent improper use. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation was damaged.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently concluded an agreement with Uber.
Convercent, like Glint, allows companies to make customised enquiries, collect answers confidentially in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, workers can anonymously report inappropriate behaviour by SMS.
And if there is reason to suspect the director of an irregularity, complaints go directly to the company's board of directors.
"Public opinion has overtaken the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
She points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene; consumers can start boycotting a company, and it can also lose employees and be taken to court.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant has more than 25 000 employees at 500 locations and has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the operating principles and procedures and can easily reach the headquarters.
In the past, the practice was that if a worker wanted to report a problem, he first had to find out the telephone number or e-mail address that was able to make a notification to the headquarters, then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, lawyer at Ruby Tuesday. According to her, it was difficult to follow the complaints made by employees.
In the past, the problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more complete and comprehensive picture of the reality of the employee," says Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from litigation related to employment relations."
According to Quinlan, following the collapse of the audit firm Arthur Andersen following unethical behaviour during the Enron scandal, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously.
It was only with social media that companies realised that they could no longer stop their dirty linen from being processed publicly.
"Hope was used as a strategy before the technology came under the control of ethics," says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for its use.
It is a business model and an opportunity accepted by private equity investors and supported by both Glinti and Convercent.
In February, Convercent collected $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised capital to a total of $47 million.
In November, Glint received EUR 10 million from the Bessemer Venture Partners and has collected funding totalling $60 million.
Investment is no surprise, given the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
A number of studies have shown that workers expect more from their jobs.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good wages and interesting projects are only the beginning.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and to give their time to a genuinely useful company.
"Employees are more committed to the success of the company if they feel comfortable with the company and listened to and rewarding their work," says Nina McQueen, Director of Linkedin, responsible for the remuneration and well-being of employees.
Investors get a return when companies thrive; companies thrive when employees commit.
Third-party analytic tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is no wonder that they are of interest to investors.
Experts in the workplace culture say that it is important to know about the commitment of employees.
but it is pointless if no action is taken on it.
If a company asks its employees for feedback, it can be regarded as a sign of change.
And if change does not come quickly enough or if nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the commitment of workers.
"If you are asking for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand debates," says Russell Raath, the chief executive consultant at Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on simply collecting information.
"If the company does not take action, employees will start to think about whether they have been consulted.
and whether their opinions matter at all.
If a company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed currently carries out staff inquiries on a monthly basis and is able to address the problem on the same day as it is reported in Glinti.
After collecting feedback from frustrated employees about the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communications, Errett was able to make changes to teams and to arrange communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it to improve the long-term sustainability of its personnel in an industry known for its high turnover.
"If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it loses employees," says Vitrano.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers there are no companies."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of concealing his naked female neighbour, says the news agency TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come home from the shower when she had noticed outside her window hanging a string away.
According to the woman, the mobile camera described the apartment.
A woman frightened by the incident had been drunk to wear in another room.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone was pulled up first, but counted shortly after the window was re-opened.
A 20-year-old man suspected of stealing has admitted that he has described a woman.
However, he claimed to have portrayed only a woman's face.
The video photographed on the mobile phone had been removed and the police had not been able to restore it as evidence.
In the interviews, the man has admitted the act, but has denied that he was guilty of the crime.
The man had justified his description by saying that he loved his neighbor 'absolutely mad'.
According to the news agency TT, a man is being prosecuted.
Teachers push for more dirty autumn negotiations
Wage trends cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the gap should be narrowed, said Olli Luukkainen, Chairman of the OAJ, on Thursday.
The temporary reduction in public sector holiday payments highlights the difference, he points out.
We are not in a position to enter into agreements which do not include in any way the holiday payments which have been made.
In the municipal sector, contracts should only be concluded once private sector papers have been signed and interest rates are clear.
Autumn predict that, for example, the working conditions of the OAJ have been agreed in January.
The percentage targets Luukkainen has not yet revealed.
He is also Chairman of the Association of educated public figures, Juko.
Lunch: Lomarahaleikkaus increases differences in earnings
According to the OAJ, the statistics and forecasts show a decline in the purchasing power of public sector employees, while at the same time the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to the licence, temporary holiday surgery will exacerbate the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it should be specified how many pupils can be per teacher
The OAJ also points out that the equivalence of primary education must be ensured, as the differences between those who do best and those who do least are increasing all the time.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are falling, and the gap between pupils and regions is widening all the time.
The Bruinsi players" day was extended as the NCAA reduced the number of daily exercises from two to one.
It will soon be eleven o'clock in the evening. A number of UCLA American football players have stayed to chat at the other end of the new training fields.
Some have stripped their jersey, and their backs shine over the sand after the first day of the training camp.
Time for many of them this few minutes chat class is a midday break.
After three hours of training, the players studying at the university's summer courses will return to their apartment to read the final examinations, and next morning they will gather at half of the seven Wasserman football centres.
"The next three days will be tough for these guys," says Bruinsi coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday's change to Tuesday.
The umbrella organisation for university sport reduced the number of training sessions on a daily basis from two to one. The amendment was aimed at lightening the workload of the players, but it has extended their days - at least until Friday, when the final final final tests will be held.
That is why UCLA's first three exercises started a quarter of an hour in the evening.
Limiting the number of traineeships to one day means that there are more days of exercise than before. The camp started this year almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in the six Westwood training period that has continued through Moran, while the exercises are taking place at the same time as the summer courses.
The intention is to hold the traineeships 18 times before 20 August, when the actual preparation for the opening ceremony of the season begins: UCLA will meet at the Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says that he supported the change in the rules of the NCAA, even though it made their timetables even tighter.
"We charge them a lot for three or four days, and that's very challenging," says Mora.
"But players are ready to work. They are great friends.
I think it will be easier when we get to Saturday, and then we will have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises after the outside camp, which is not easy given the direct view of the internship parking area and the Luskiskis Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombed on footballs flying over the protective net behind the finish line.
Bruinsi players are supposed to move to their hotel this coming weekend, but Mora admits that problems may arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," says Mora.
"The worry is that people can book a room and describe the exercises from there on the video. It's not an exaggerated concern.
A great deal of money is paid for the video that depicts the exercises.
But we have guards there and in the parking area.
We will do our best.
I am not going to get too worked up about it.
We have a plan."
Freedom for Rwanda
On Friday, a mediaeval Rwanda holds presidential elections, the winner of which is already being seen.
Paul Kagame is officially aiming for his third term, but in practice he has influenced the running of the country since 1994.
The RPF then ended the genocide organised by the extremists.
Kagame was the RPF commander.
Kagame has been criticised for, among other things, crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of speech.
He has also been accused, for example, of falsifying poverty statistics.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to reach its destination because of the change in the constitution, which restricted the presidency to two terms.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely held leader.
During his time, Rwanda has undergone social reforms and international investment has flowed.
In addition, Kagamel has played a major role in the reunification of a country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African countries.
However, Kagas, too, has promised its people more freedom after the country has been put on its feet.
It might be a good moment to start.
Facebook fights false news by stepping up factual verification
Facebook intends to send possible fake news to more and more independent fact inspectors and present the results below the original article. The world's largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website stating that it will start using an updated computer thesis to identify false news. Possible fake news will be sent to fact inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the biggest propagators of the false news. Many believe that the false news influenced the outcome of the American presidential election in 2016.
The subject has arisen in the political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed with lies before the presidential election in May and Germany, which is preparing for the September elections, is supporting the plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that the fact-finding is being tried out in the United States, France, Holland and Germany.
"People want to see which stories do not pass through the screen of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more enlightened what they read and share," says Sara Su, the product manager of Facebook's news article in the company blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the related articles and will also make other changes to its news in order to reduce fake news.
The birth of the comic strip: The story of a castle
The small Scotney Castle in County Kent is known today as the music video of Squeeze and the hidden place of Margaret Thatcher from the 1970s and 1980s.
It has, however, 700 years of turbulent history behind it, and now this lovely place in the Bewl valley is the subject of a comics book written by Jamie Rhodes, a moped particle writer attached to old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to study a text written by a person who died over 300 years ago," Rhodes says blindly.
"I feel personal fellowship as I hold the letter in my hand."
The book of Rhodesi, A Castle in England, tells stories of Scotney-inhabited families from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian age. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes's first book based on archives. In 2014, Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by documents from the British National Library, came out of him.
"I was moved to tears when I noticed a thumb copy in the letter. The letter had been written by a dual agent for Jacobits in the 18th century," says Rhodes.
"It was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell of the smoke, because fire was then used as lighting.
Three centuries later the scent makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love the archives!"
He admits that he did not feel comfortable in the castle for a little longer than he would have wished, with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Arts Council of England.
He spent the days researching the "new" castle of Victorian, archives, treasures and rare things, such as the smile heads hung on the walls and centuries of bottles of whales.
She went round the ruins and the premises of the old castle and talked to the forest guards, to the gardeners and sometimes to the artists who illustrate the book.
In the evenings she "took whisky and started writing."
The closer history of Scotney is rather unknown, as it was only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, that the castle was fully transferred to the National Trust Foundation in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation's staff were only just starting to run through the repository. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: taking all the extra to the attic.
The archives had day books, letters from the days of the British Empire and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that land disputes are boring," says Rhodes. "Here, however, families are fighting for even one birch.
It occurred to me that I wouldn't be already."
Some of the stories in the book go from the castle to the history of England, like The Labour. It tells about a man who will join shortly after the completion of the castle to the peasant insurrection of England in 1381.
"The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," says Rhodes.
"The peasant insurrection in England began in the same area, and it came to mind that the insurrection could begin with a riot.
Maybe these events are interconnected?"
The book's other stories are closely related to the history of the castle - such as The Priest, the story of the priests that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the Reformation of England.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of the smuggler Arthur Darrell in the 1700s. He is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his tomb was opened).
The Darrels are the favourite family of Rhodesi in Scotney. "The men of the family seem to have been pretty crooks. They were constantly in debt and bought things they could not afford.
The men of the family of Darrell solved their debt problems by marrying old wealthy women, whom I see as handsome friends who were able to fly around the periphery."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book on Life, a healer from the beginning of the 20th century, of which only a eutrophic plot remains.
The castle of Scotney has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave," she says.

Between the worst in Russia since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think one can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped to be able to seek close cooperation with Russia.
But, especially since the illegal annexation of the Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability in the territory of eastern Ukraine caused by Russia, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO remains committed to ensuring that tensions do not peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to have a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid an escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Mr Stoltenberg made his comments, US President Donald Trump was able to say that relations between the USA and Russia had reached a dangerous low point.
Mr Trump called for a 'thank you' to Congress, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitshko concludes - Renewal match against Anthony Joshua does not materialise
Vladimir Klitshko, the world champion of a long-standing professional chain, will finish his career.
The Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
At the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, Klitshko, as a professional, was able to match 69 times, winning 64 matches.
He held various World Championships between 2000 and 02 and 2006-15.
The cluster lost his career in the last two matches.
Tyson Fury hit him in November 2015.
In April this year Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at the Stadium of Wembley and lost in the 11th instalment after a wild match.
Joshua and Klitshkon were expected to meet again in November at Las Vegas.
However, the clinic could not find any motivation for the match.
I deliberately took a few weeks to make a decision so that I had enough distance to go to the Wembley match, a Klitshko told me in a note.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sport.
I could never have imagined that I would have had such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitshko's explanatory statement for its decision on video.
The Klitshko manager Bernd Bönte reported in the bulletin that the decision to stop was difficult for Klitshko.
However, she has always stressed that she wants to stop if she no longer has enough motivation.
That is why, as Mrs Bönte said, this is absolutely the right decision.
The clique has been socialising with the American actor Hayden Panettieren since 2009.
The couple has one child, the daughter Kaya born in 2014.
Big brother Vitali is also a former world champion of heavy grades.
Between 2008 and 12 the brothers managed the World Championships of the various federations at the same time.
The Finnish meteorologist wipes the circumstances: "View the list"
The detailed jumper, Minna Nikkanen, has suffered from conditions during the summer's external iron period.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the circumstances.
Wind and cold have deprived a woman of a positive list.
The World Cup in London is also unstable.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
Circumstances have been a family jump against Minna Nikka.
I do not want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I could not even get the small walls to move properly, as Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck contest.
I have competed and practiced here for the umpteenth time and I have never experienced such a varied wind in this place, Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmi in Games.
During this period it has been very difficult to keep the jump on a permanent footing, as there have been such unstable winds in exercises, Nikkanen said during the Kaleva Games.
Weather also spoke in London on Thursday.
The challenge of the time has been to get the technology together - whether it is a cold box or what.
It has been cold and windy, and it has taken from the list.
There is no point in consuming energy in poor conditions.
He got to the World Cup thanks to his hall jump of 455.
Outdoor has gone 445.
The conditions in London are not the same for everyone.
You have to be calm and wait for better winds.
The goal is to exceed 4,460 on Friday.
Why not change your training abroad?
It is not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany for the first period.
I got a hypy pile and the technique standardized.
I think we should have done the same now.
Normally she has got into the hall to practice, now she has been caught.
What would be the ideal contest?
25 degrees warm.
Even a small wind will go, as long as it is constant.
Kokenut ex-official rubber-stamped politicians in the Yle: "We have no division now nor for many years"
In spite of the positive economic climate, the government of Juha Sipila must hold its breath and avoid inflating the state budget with debt, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets for decades in the Ministry of Finance.
He said that there is no margin.
In 2015, he was interviewed about Estonia, which was retired at the beginning of Wednesday morning.
Construction of next year's state budget is just starting.
Recently, the suggestion of politicians, for example, to increase the guarantee pension, lower car tax and support electric bikes, is considered by Estonia to be election speeches.
They are basically telling us that the elections are starting to be close, because when 10% of a country's budget is financed by additional debt, we have no margin for division now or for many years.
I think it is even a fraud to talk about a redistribution reserve when the debt is taken, Virtanen said to the United Nations.
Virtanen emphasized that all debt owes to children.
Estonia has a long history of preparing public budgets: in 1978, she started as budget secretary in the Ministry of Finance and then worked as deputy head and budget manager of the budget department.
Most recently before retiring, he served as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
Virtanen remarked in an interview with Yle that the economic growth now forecast of 3% is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is a thorn from which to go to a low level in the coming year, and Finland is expecting a 1% increase for decades.
Washington modifies the rules on permanent residence
According to media reports, President Donald Trump announced that the rules on permanent residence, or Green Card, would be changed by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and restrict family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to nationals of other countries.
It will also reduce chain migration and replace the current program.
The new application process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and who have skills that are beneficial to our economy."
The spouse of the Queen of Denmark does not want to be buried with the Queen in the same place
Prince Henrik does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margaret were photographed in April.
The Queen of Denmark, Margareeta, 77, and her husband Prince Henrik, 83, is not buried side by side, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, governors' couples in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The Queen has today announced that Prince Henrik does not wish to be buried in the Roskilde cathedral, she says in a press release on Thursday.
According to the BT magazine, this is due to the prince's dissatisfaction with its role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with its role and title in the Danish monarchy, and Lene Belleby, the head of communications at the Court, commented in the newspaper.
The decision by Prince not to be buried alongside the Queen is a natural consequence of the fact that he is not treated as an equal to his spouse.
According to Hovin, the Queen has long been aware of her spouse's desire for a place in the tomb and understands the decision.
Horse moment on the road: The car had to come on the highway
Tommi had an unmarried partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but they would not receive any money from insurance unless the other party was targeted.
Turma happened in the case of Keimolanport in Vantaa.
The archive image from the building site of Developing III.
Tommi from Vantaa tells us that his family survived a miracle in a car accident on Tuesday.
In the case of Keimolanport, Tommi, her unmarried partner, Rina, and two small children from the couple drove on the motorway to Hämeenlinna in Vantaa.
With the accession of the third to the Hämeenlinna, the white car, which was to drive the family's car to the side, was rushed along the high speed band, says Tommi.
Without a driving force, the car would have been on top of Tomm.
I was holding up and turning the car at the same time and it got out of hand," says Tommi.
A family car collided at a very fast rate with a gun.
The parents and the two small children who were in the back row were not injured.
One is a little under 3 years old, the other is under one year old.
There was obviously a pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No-one who passed by drove even towards us, even though there was busy traffic.
The accident took place at about 5.20 p.m.
According to Tomm, no one stopped at them and the family called the emergency centre.
They were able to get out of the car by their own efforts.
The staff of the Ambulance and the Rescue Agency came and the condition of the family was checked.
The car went to the redemption centre.
Tommi tells that he and his cohabiting partner had low incomes, and they received a grant from the family to buy a car a couple of years ago.
According to Tomm, without the information of another car, the family will not receive any money from insurance.
That is why the family wants eye-witnesses to find out about the car that drove the family to the ditch.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take children on a stick and go and work without it," says Tommi.
Tommi saw that the car was white, old-fashioned.
It was probably the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 21st century.
In his opinion, the start of the car registration number was SIG.
If someone is not caught, I do not know how we are doing financially, we will still have to count every penny today.
Tommi hopes that those who have seen or know something about what has happened will have contact with the police.
The Police Service in Eastern Uusimaa and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Agency confirm that they had a mission on Tuesday evening at the scene of the accident.
The title and the case were corrected at 9.15 p.m.: Contrary to what was originally reported in the case, the other car, according to Tomm, did not come on the corresponding band, but had to be driven from an accelerator to the village of the family car.
Lotta Jäppinen's controlled show deals with human relationships by humour - The self-handler is seen in What? - Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings her first experience to the Which theatre.
Self-proofing is a musical performance about past relationships and inadequacies.
According to the director, Lotta Jäppinen, it still leaves a good mind.
The subject is dealt with by means of humour.
He says, there will be no rest in unpleasant feelings.
According to Jäppinen, the moving summer theatre performance has been executed with a small budget and a large, young heart.
The title of the motion challenges us to reflect on what a person reveals about himself when he comes to a new person.
Is he perhaps appealing for a role, or is he approaching another coat open?
Draft by Juoneton mixes fact with fiction
The Member has both directed and dramatised the performance.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The motion is made up of texts from the working group and there is no plot.
The director believes that although the performance draws from the thoughts of young people, it addresses people of all ages.
The honourable member points out that the self-help officer does not directly report on his or her own human relations or that of the working group.
Fact and fiction are confused.
My own world of values will certainly be conveyed.
I do not think that relationships are bad, but neither do I think that relationships, especially relationships, are a precondition for happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
The gentleman believes that the self-help teacher draws up a current picture of the young adults living in Finland at the age of one hundred.
According to him, many have learned a lot about the relationships between people and their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
There is no need to remain in a bad relationship.
The exhibition will be held by Minea Lång, Niklas Rauté and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes the dresser Ella Snellman.
The music matching is between Jäppinen and Roka.
Love for theatre started in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, from school, 26, is studying as a director of theatre expression at the Academy of Arts of the University of Turku.
Here is two years and in front of the second mokoma.
The enthusiasm of the member for the theatre has begun in the years of Kouvolan.
The breed of the music classes has been an assistant in the theatre of Kouvola and has played, among other things, at the Student Assessment in Helsinki and most recently in Linnateatter in Turku.
Control has become more and more interesting.
Last week in Helsinki, on the stage of Narri, the self-handler got his first night.
A performance lasting about 45 minutes should also be seen in the future, at least in the studying town of Jäppinen in Turku.
Self-editor Kouvolan Which?" at 7.8 p.m. and 5.8 p.m. at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.
The Finnish Olympic winner recovered from a gruesome motocrosson accident for a year - the oak was broken
Few athletes in Finland have the same kind of unstoppable force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
The city of Kumparela toured the world hundreds of days a year for a couple of years and chased its dream of an Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the movement of Lahtela continued.
He was not only an indefatigable trainee, but also a pilot of new species.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on Earth that a chemist would not have tried at least once.
It has been an inspiration to practice.
There is always something new," Lahtela says.
Eventually one hobby was to stop Lahtela altogether.
In 2014, Lahtela was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I was not at any work.
I was asleep at home for a year," Lahtela says.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that old people could play their part in peat.
Pre-driving may sound wild.
But it was looking for borders.
It is just a species so hard, that on issues like the 40s should not be too amateur!
After the accident Lahtela found herself in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
Gone was a long time ago as the chief coach of the Japanese pavilion.
Lahtela started to wash immediately after his own career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be in my seat.
I didn't really do much," says Lahtela.
Even during the coaching period, Lahtela often challenged his protective brain and physicists.
Surprisingly, it was a good experience to stop.
I was so tired physically and mentally that my own ideas did not make sense either.
Not even with the species.
Teki good to be in place.
I really enjoyed it, because for once I could really just be.
The compulsory break inspired Lahtela as the Finnish chief coach.
Without stopping, he fears he would have burned out.
It is easier to find places in crown that have gone through than swamped!
Without an accident, I would not have realised that I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started off as coach of the Finnish pavilion about a year ago.
At the same time he found a safer hobby in place of the detonators.
I switched motocrossit to frisbeegolf!
It just went out of the building right away.
At worst, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Even though Lahtela himself has always been a super-eager trainer, he does not require his coaching to be the same as he did.
I will not force everybody into the same mould.
There is space in our species culture to be their own and to be ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle has a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with it," Lahtela says.
Sex irobots come and we need to be concerned
It is here: a report on technological developments in the sex industry - just when it had begun to feel that 2017 can no longer be a strange year.
Yes, yes.
Sex irobots are a big thing now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex objects over the next five to ten years.
"We need to start taking the growth of sex objects seriously," says the founder member of the foundation and Professor Noel Sharkey Sheffield of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the colour of the robot's eyes, the shape of the stars and the type of fingerprints.
"Sex irobots are being hanged, but they are already being sold quite a lot, and we will see more of them," said Sharkey at the launch of the report.
The cheques have evolved from being blown dolls to robots with a warm-felt silicone skin and artificial intelligence features that are reminiscent of human behavior.
The user can also adjust robot to their own preferences, from the color of the eyes to the shape of the stars and the type and color of the fingerprints.
It is all the more worrying that robots have a 'personality' which makes Stepford's women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex support has developed into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, for example to be shy.
The 'True Companion' Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
"The personality of Roxxxxy Gold conforms as fully as possible to the personality of the user," the company's website is advertised.
In other words, the robot keeps the same things as the user.
It also has different opinions:
It can be tired, say, with a story or "that's the mood."
There are many worrying features of the proliferation of sex irobots, which are a substitute for genuine human relations, but what is even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies, as the user approaches a programmed robot, for example, which is shy and resistant.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot to vibrator on its website:
"Women have a vibrator. Why should men not have sex objects?"
Sex irobots, however, are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex makeup.
Their generalisation and development is indicative of something darker and deeper in our culture: the recession from gender equality to sexual intercourse, in which repression is one of the alternatives.
The majority of men, of course, do not acquire sex objects, and their popularity remains marginal, although the FRR report indicated their growing popularity.
However, sexual phenomena speak volumes about the spirit of the times.
And many will only start behaving strangely or offensively when the market gives permission.
It is no coincidence that sexy wars have begun to spread at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world and there is a President in the White House who has boasted of harassing women.
In the television series The Handmaid's Tale (Orjattaresi) is not the most worrying of its powerful image, for example, pictures of hanged bodies and out-of-mouths eyes. What is most disturbing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
There is an attempt to do as much as is technically possible about sexual irobots as real women.
Robot developers want their skin to feel authentic and movements to mimic human movements as best they can.
Their 'personalities' are, however, far from reality.
Robot cannot leave the relationship or situation.
They have no will of their own, no history - no independence, no fantasy of total subservience.
They are pleasant servants.
Orthodox.
Police suspects: two terrorist attacks were planned in Australia, led by Mr Isis's Chief of Staff
The head of an extremist organisation, Mr Isis, led a group of Australian men who are suspected of planning to take a bomb to an aeroplane belonging to the company Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a leading figure in the father had also sent a bomb to Sydney.
The suspicion was that the bomb was to be carried on board the aircraft on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police do not explain in detail why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a toxic colourless gas breakdown device and take the equipment to a crowded public location, for example a public transport facility.
Michael Phelan, Deputy Supreme Allied Commissioner, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were seized in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation is also continuing.
The pros and cons of the Trump?
Make Mitt Romney look like the beacon of common sense
It has been repeated ad nauseam in the Trump era that families have also been broken up by the large, everyday dichotomy of the electorate.
Towards Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers were advised on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
We are all supposed to burst our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to reunite families.
I say this because my cousin was swimming around me this week in New York, a poet from the Left who live in Chicago and who has long been in direct opposition to our relations with the Republicans.
He recalled that a common enemy can have a strong unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all my cousins - including the Republican sister, with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades - are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
On a dinner table that is a good thing, but on a broader level it entails significant risks.
Mr Trump has given the left a new impetus, but the distortive effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and 'normalisation', we are talking about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to terrify his tricks.
In the long term, there is an even more horrific possibility that Trump will normalize the republicans of the right extreme, who, compared to Trump, suddenly appear to be quite reasonable.
I recall with a hint the moderate version of Mitt Romney's madness: a dog on the car roof, a 14% income tax (and his tax return we have seen at least) which, compared to a credit card, seems to be a very minor offence.
When the Trump period is over, the Republicans" next presidential candidate only needs to be clear-sighted, and it immediately feels like a considerable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the Central Park carousel. It is the biggest carousel in the New York Park department and the best thing you can get on three dollars without caffeine in New York.
The horses of the carousel are huge, the characters in the middle - the grotesque clowns and the animals behind the horror - are sinister, and the underlying thrilling music is curiously fascinating.
Many of the attributes of New York are becoming disappointing over time: the prospects of high buildings are getting tired, the city bridge is becoming too familiar and the reality of the city does not match the dreams.
And I still, after 35 years, have not completely got over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large traffic circuit in northern London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage may be a Swiss-inspired pub, but it is not counted.
The central banquet, on the other hand, is still a strange magic experience - so much so that two women are two years old, one year old and two four-pen women enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my estimate, but fortunately no one came and asked.
Instead, I was asked this week in a department store to assess my 'payment experience' on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card on a reading device.
It's the same in a cafe at my doorstep, but there I'm also given the opportunity to combine a 15% service allowance with an estimate when I go to see the coffee counter for myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer servant to put his person in the game when he or she is not needed.
The salesman of the mortgage smiles with a sorry feeling when I gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inter - "There was no management trust"
Today, FC Inter has released Shefki Kuq from the position of coach of the club.
Mr Fabrizio Piccareta, a former assistant coach, is responsible for the coaching.
The rest of the training team will continue in its current tasks.
Piccareta, an Italian, has been a deputy coach in the past, for example, in British Sunderland.
In January, the 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined the Inter training group, carried out a UEFA Pro licence last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of FC Inter's Board of Directors, regrets that this has happened.
Exchanging coaches is never an easy or pleasant task.
Shefki Kuq, however, no longer had the trust of the leadership of the Society, so that there was no other option now, Håkans commented in a bulletin of the Society.
The Piccareta Agreement is valid until the end of the period.
Together with the rest of the coaching team, he is already responsible for tomorrow's home match against the HIFK.
According to evening-Sanomat data, the team has been buzzing along Thursday.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the club's assistant coaches from Piccareta and John Allen have been displaced.
Last Saturday, Kuqi and Piccareta clashed strongly in the Inter match against PS Kem.
Linda Lampenius published a youthful picture in the 80s - would you recognise a serious violin student?
On Instagram, a hotline, Linda Lampenius, published a youth photo.
Several hashish has been added to the photo, on the basis of which it can be deduced that the musician is a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Mr Lampenius himself wonders very seriously about a young woman watching a camera.
Long ago, serious, he signalled.
If the photo is not shown, you can view it here.
Mr Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
Over a year ago, he published a picture of himself in Instagram.
In one picture he was seen 20 years ago, in the other he is posing now, as a mother of two children.
In his picture text, Lampenius considers his own growth as a human being and refers to eating disorders he suffered at a younger age.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look very much the same as that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learned to like myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added hashtags life, eating disorder, uncertainty, self-confidence, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Mr Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating cages in previous years.
She was already 14 years old in hospital because of anorexia and orthoorexia.
A little later he also became ill with bulimia, which eventually was not revealed until 2006.
Improvement started slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampeniusta helped a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to hospital for chest pains
This is the second time that Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year he was hospitalized for shoes on his shores which, according to the prison authorities, he was allowed to crash in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of the murder after the prosecution of the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of St. Petersburg's Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have told us that they intend to appeal again because they consider the six-year sentence of Pistorius to be too lenient.
The Prosecutor General intends to appeal to the Supreme Court in South Africa and the appeal may be heard as early as this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the Pistorius judgment may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not used in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for unlawful camping in Greece
Two illegally-camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs according to the BTV channel.
A number of people camped without permission were arrested by the police in Sithon on the morning of 1 August, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to the television channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules on free campsites and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone camping in areas other than those for which provision is made.
Inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry declared that the right may impose a fine.
The stock of the liquid sinks - already sunk -7,7%
The oil refiner Neste's share has fallen by 7.7% at around 11 a.m.
The result before taxes fell, but exceeded the projection compiled by Inquiry Financial.
The stock exchange trade has started today on the frost side, both in Finland and in the rest of Europe.
Shortly after the opening of stock exchanges, the large European Stoxx 600 index had fallen by 0.2%.
The general index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange, OMXH, had fallen by 0.3% to 9509.48 points after half an hour trading and 0.3% by OMXH25 of the most fluent companies.
The total stock exchange was EUR 41 million, nine million of which was morning's result publisher Nety.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate may help alleviate the syndrome of irritated bowels
Red meat and chocolate may sound like the nightmares of the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet with high levels of meat protein and dairy products may facilitate syndrome of irritated bowels.
The syndrome of infected bowels is an incurable disease affecting approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in Great Britain. It causes abdominal muscle, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers of the University of Washington, however, found that the necessary amino acid tryptophane contained in the protein helps the body to develop immune defects that strengthen the bowel's tolerance.
According to research director Marco Colonta, immune capital guards and ensures that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Inflammatory cells balance cells that strengthen tolerance. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance drops too close to inflammation, the result may be irritated bowel syndrome.
Tests found that the immune cells that confirm tolerance are present in mice with a specific bacteria in the intestine.
The bacterium in question needs tryptophan in order to be able to develop immune accumulators, which is one of the ingredients used to build proteins.
"We identified a link between the development of the Lactobacillus reuteri bacterium and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of a normal microbiotic intestine," says Professor Colonna.
"The more tryptophane there was in the mouse's diet, the more immune colourings of this kind."
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophane can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammatory resistance.
Studying the immune solutions confirming tolerance, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan observed that although one group of mice had such cells, they did not have the same mouse, which was kept apart from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the gastrointestinal micro-biometrics, i.e. to the normal gastrointestinal system of bacteria, fungi and viruses in the community.
When the intestinal DNA of the mice was examined, six bacteria were found which were present in the mice with immune fats but not in other mice.
When the Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were administered to mice grown in sterile environments without intestinal microbiotics and for which no immune accumulators developed, they began to show immune particles.
Researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system; they bred Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the fluid and transferred small amounts of fluid - without bacteria - from the mouse to isolated, immature immune particles.
Immune cells evolved into cells confirming tolerance.
When the active ingredient was purified of liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptofaan metabolism, known as indoli-3 lactic acid.
When scientists doubled the amount of tryptofaan in the diet of mice, the number of cells confirming tolerance increased by around 50%. When the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, man has the same endurance cells as a mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptofaan by-products from Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria will allow cells to develop in humans in the same way as if they were mice. However, people who have contracted the syndrome of the affected salt have discovered genetic defects related to tryptophan.
"We certainly want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inland surfaces of the veins," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"High levels of tryptophates combined with Lactobacillus reuteri may contribute to their spread."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got the "nerve" into its ranks after concluding a contract with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got into its ranks as a "genius" following an agreement with Nemanja Matic. The average resident debytoi in the ranks of Manchester United in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea with £40 million, started a 2-1 win match in Dublin, in a pre-United match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday, impressing as a defensive midfield player against stars such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
Matic, however, was not yet in the best condition because he was not on the Blue Competition Asian tour before the start of the season. He was on the ground for only 45 minutes - a change that, according to Mourinho, must be made before the Premier League began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and ways of thinking make him a genius - he has a natural ability to think in football," says Mourinho.
"We help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matici, the newcomers Victor Lindelof and Ronoise Lukaku were starting a game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to slip into the starting code for the start of the season.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a "great job" by acquiring three of his four preferred players.
"Three out of four - thanks to the club," he added.
"I'm happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Flight women annoyed Germany for two instalments
The Finnish Women's Aeroplane team lost its 4th World Cup qualifying tournament to Germany directly respectively 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany has a high level of routine playing.
From the level of their game was in every sector, Tapio Kangasniemi, the main Finnish coach, reported in a note.
In the first two periods Finland kept its opponents in check, but in the third period Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we were played patiently and in certain places with enough aggression, so it was possible to bounce along," Kangasniemi said.
The most powerful country in Finland was the 14 points collected by Piia Korhonen.
On Sunday, Finland, which has lost four matches, will meet Slovenia again.
Reuters: Major jury has already sent challenges to the Russia meeting of Trump Jr
In the United States, the great jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaja.
A large jury, convened by the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, has already sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer known for the Kremlin.
Reuters, the news agency, also confirms the information previously revealed by the Wall Street Journal on Thursday about the convening of a large jury.
According to Reuters, challenges have been raised by a large jury in connection with the meeting between Trump Jr and Veselnitskaya, known as the Kremlin, which took place in the middle of the US presidential election in June 2016.
Paul Manafort, then campaigner chief at Donald Trump Sr, and his peers, Jared Kushner, current advisor to the White House, were also present.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, has convened a large jury in Washington means that the pace of the Russian investigation has been stepped up.
The sources add that Mueller wanted to assist the great jury in his inquiry into Russia's interference in the American presidential elections and whether the Trump campaign or his entourage cooperated with Russia on this issue.
The large jury extends Mueller's rights to gather evidence, to transmit challenges, and to force people to testify with authority.
The great jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
A large jury will weigh up the evidence in the prosecutor's investigation and decide whether prosecutions should be brought.
A British inventor microchips himself to get to his home and his car with a hand-waving arm
The British inventor is the first person in the whole country to micro-circuit himself, so that he can open the door to his home, get into his office and start his car with a wave of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and index finger of Steven Northam, a 33-year-old, and now offers a service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of Northam BioTeq.
Northam is working with the sleeping doctor Geoff Watson, consulting the consultant at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hantsi, to ensure that the installation of the microchip meets medical requirements.
The microchip uses a technique similar to that of cats and dogs in microchips, and it takes only 30 seconds to install it.
Northam's attempt also makes the locks of houses and cars compatible with the microchip. Dealing with one lock costs £300.
Northam is married and has one child. He has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibition cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
Last month's decision by the White House to fly a naval helicopter to the southern grass of the White House for an event presenting American production cost the taxpayer $24,000.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is referred to as Marine One when the President is at his fingertips; it was a laundry at a ceremony in the White House on 17 July 2017 at which American construction programmes were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and a number of White House officials looked at the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the Connecticut helicopter, there was also a sailboat from Maine, a fire car from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississip.
The White House Military Office had requested, by order of the helicopter, only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn for an 'extraordinary' event, as can be seen from the documents of the HMX-1 naval helicopter flotilla.
"I just wanted to make sure that you are aware of this, because it is an exceptional event that will get a lot of visibility," the head of HMX-1 wrote the day before the event in an e-mail to his superior, who is an auxiliary command of naval air traffic.
The message was that the helicopter would arrive on the southern lawn at 17:7 o'clock in the morning and the event would begin in three o'clock in the afternoon. The helicopter would only leave after the lawn was emptied in the evening between 6 and 9.
In addition, the message indicated that if there were a delay in the departure of the helicopter from the White House, a second crew would be needed due to the restrictions on service times.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the incident and the unit's security staff were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by TIME whether a second crew was ultimately needed.
The Hatch Act of the United States prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 inquired whether the incident was in breach of the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a breach of the Hatch Act. We were told there was no violation," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," replied the assistant commandant.
Made in America was an official event in the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the time, the President spoke out in favour of health reform and less state regulation in the Senate.
The political use of the Marine One helicopter and Air Force One is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them for their travels,
but their use only for photos is unusual.
The Trump action attracted attention in February, when Air Force One rolled the presidential campaign to the background in Melbourne, Florida State, and Mr Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor's presidential plane on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the 'Made in America' event, which showcased products made by American workers from all 50 states, said Lindsay Walters, White House Press Officer.
The HMX-1 crews regularly carry out training flights in Washington and practice in the southern lawn, bringing the President to the White House with the accuracy of centimetres.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training visits to the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of the crew' s monthly training quota.
On that day, helicopters from the unit were also flying for 11 hours in 'non-presidential support missions'.
According to the White House, the incident did not incur any additional costs to the taxpayer.
Sikorsky's spokesman said that the company was not involved in organising the demonstration of a helicopter on the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 has no accounts for flights connected with the presidential duties, and it is difficult to estimate the costs of the incident accurately.
According to the Ministry of Defence's 2017 compensation, the VH-3D helicopter will have a level of compensation of USD 24 380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 documents, flights from the Quantico base in Virginia to the White House and the total duration of the refund period was one hour.
According to the White House, the cost of using the helicopter is significantly lower.
"Calculating the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," says Walters.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called "sunk expenses" that will be taken into account in the annual envelope."
According to a survey conducted by RAND in 2015, the levels of compensation do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, the former White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, defended the use of a helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to showcase American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and will probably employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think that, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans have worked so hard on.
It is entirely appropriate to point this out."
It is not certain whether he went to Trump helicopter at the time of the incident, but at least he sat down at the fire-car driver's seat.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said. "I have three of them."
Vaasa track was hit by snow - trains have to be replaced by buses
The passenger train traffic between the wall and Vaasa is interrupted due to a technical fault, announces the Rail Traffic Centre.

The fault in traffic control was caused by the thunderstorm.
In the morning there was no estimate of the duration of the repair.
Public Prosecutor in Venezuela calls for the right to prevent the appointment of a new parliamentary assembly
The Public Prosecutor of Venezuela has applied for a court ruling that would prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
The President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that a delegation elected at the vote last Sunday is to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, the country was elected to a representative assembly which, among other things, may change its constitution.
According to the chief prosecutor, Luisa Ortega, a denial decision has been requested because of suspected electoral fraud.
Mr Ortega has also opened an inquiry into electoral fraud.
He appointed two judges to the post, after the British company that organised the parliamentary vote said that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of real voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated, and the elected 545 members include the son and wife of Maduro.
In addition to changing the constitution, the assembly can dissolve the congress of the opposition and change the laws.
Maduroa described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the constitution as a means for Maduro to assert itself.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro, calling it a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have declared that they will not recognise the new representation.
Maduro claims that the new representation is the solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, the unrest has been going on for months.
Numerous people have been injured and more than a hundred have died.
Venezuela entered an economic crisis after the fall in oil prices.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicines.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when the new assembly is due to begin.
A Russian man handed over by Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, the court in Minneapolis in the United States sentenced the 41-year-old Masim Senah to nearly four years in prison for being involved in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a request by the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
She was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when she was returning home.
In February 2016, Senah was handed over to the US judicial authorities in spite of Russian protests, according to the news agency AFP.
In March this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud which had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah received 46 months' imprisonment.
According to the US Department of Justice, Senah is expelled from the country after serving a prison sentence.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reproached Finland harshly after the arrest and said that the man should not be extradited to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were reproached for the fact that the arrest was carried out in Finland without Russia knowing about it beforehand.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a Ebury computer virus, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
Users and passwords were caught using the virus.
The fraudsters subsequently used the data by continuing to control internet traffic, which was used to make clicks and distribute spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, acting Director of the Criminal Department of the Ministry of Justice, the case shows that the United States is also capable of pursuing other active cyber criminals.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, as Mr Blanco said in the communiqué.
Modified at 8.58 p.m. Renovation of the name of the convicted person.
Trailer for Narcos' third production period: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so the Cali cartel will take centre stage in Netflix's welter series
Although the killer of Pablo Escobar was exposed during the second Narcos production period, the Netflix series is far from over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth periods of production will be seen in the series. The third period trailer has been released and the new toads in the series are presented.
In the third production period, the US drugs police DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the richest drug-trafficking organisation in the world.
An organisation led by four godfathers will operate 'like Fortune 500', except that there is a little more corruption and violence among the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) deals with connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In the recent trailer Pedro Pascal is returning to Javier Peñana, who recruits US and Colombian police officers for the war against drugs.
The new faces are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third production period begins on 1 September.
Kari Kola performs an exceptional work of light art in Paris
The Joensury Light Artist Kari Kola (kuavssa) is carrying out an exceptional work of photography to commemorate the first Valo Day set by the UN in Paris on 16 May next year.
Three make a work of light in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work sheds light on the building of Unesco's headquarters, Fontenoy, and the Globe monument in front of it.
In my work I want to highlight not only light but also darkness.
Today, light pollution in millions of cities is a major problem affecting the well-being of us all.
With the help of my art, I can give concrete visibility to what I think is important," says Kari Kola, a photographer, about her work.
I am very impressed by the invitation to attend the first International Light Day and to bring the art of light into the theme day," says Kola.
Kari Kola attended the inauguration of the Valo Year in 2015, when she enlightened the UNESCO headquarters to mark the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to be able to restore my art to UNESCO headquarters, says Kari Kola.
The work may still be expanding considerably.
We will inform you about this later this autumn, says Kola.
The aim of International Valley Day is to highlight the importance of light for mankind and to raise people's awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first of these days will be celebrated at the headquarters of UNESCO in the centre of Paris on 16 May.
Two men fighting in the shopping park of Espoo
Two men were disputed in Espoo in the Parking Hall of the Centre of Commerce in Omena, Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute arose when the other party inadvertently pursued the banned traffic direction.
There was an oral dispute between drivers.
A driver who drives in a banned direction would be flying around the driver of another car, as a result of which this car started off in a colliding bull's car.
After this he found the car still in the bonnet.
In his introductory speech, the man has admitted that he had caused the damage and that he had done the wrong thing.
The title of Timo Soini's question marks: "After that came the flood"
Mr Timo Soini (uv), Minister for Foreign Affairs, published a blog post on Thursday, which is entitled 'Questions Label'.
The writing is short, just two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to thirty deputies of the governing party.
After that came the flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
There are references in Mr Soin's text to France in the eighteenth century.
King Ludvig XV or this mistress madame de Pompadouri is known to have used a deluge metaphor.
Depending on the interpretation, the history books have left the pronouncements "the flood after us" or "the flood after me."
UN tells us that democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
The elections will only be representative if they allow all members of society to vote, including women, said the head of the UN mission to Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the provisional head of the UN mission, said that there were hundreds of women standing for election to the provincial councils, that three women sought to be vice-president and that more than 30% of newly registered voters were women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," said Haysom in his statement on Wednesday.
The elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all aspects of the electoral process.
The Afghan provincial and presidential elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban have issued electoral threats at the same time as the international force is moving towards an advisory role.
This year's elections are the first time that power has been transferred from one democratically elected government to another.
Mr Haysom said that women's contribution will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

Flood of certain tourists threatening the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The fury of the locals is directed in particular at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister for Culture calls it 'eat and flee' tourism: there are only a few hours at the site and people are rushing through the sights in the masses.
Venice is stifled by the rapid daily trips to the city by tourists.
It is difficult to move around the streets in the streets in the streets, and the great squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice are no longer able to join us.
They have been forced to move further away from the historic centre, while the homes have been replaced by hotels.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
The authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, time is given for two or three hours.
Follow the ticket-keeping guide to the Piazzale Roma Rialto Bridge and the St. Markuksen market, and turn back, describes the prevailing and troublesome tourist situation of the Italian Minister for Culture, Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of places, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the city's identity.
The square of St. Markuksen is also one of the most popular tourist destinations of the historic center of Venice.
On the edge of the tower is the Church of St. Mark.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
The historic center of Venice no longer has 50,000 localities.
In 1951 the population was about 175,000.
In July, an estimated 2 000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroying the environment and driving the inhabitants away.
Approximately 2 000 inhabitants leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years time Venice will be like tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who organised the demonstration.
This is a difficult equation, as the boats bring to Venice the revenue it so desperately needs and create the need for a large number of jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution envisaged is for cruises to move away from the historical centre.
In the opinion of Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the Veneto administrative district, in which Venice is also situated, were to acquire more power over its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Every year, some 20-30 million tourists visit Venice.
Are you drifting towards Kuopio?
Heavy congestion per kilometre on the motorway
On the motorway between Kuopio and Lake Siilinjärvi, in the north of the north, there have been kilometres of congestion from work on Thursday afternoon during the time of return traffic.
The area is involved in the coating of a motorway, which slows down traffic," says Savon Sanomat.
For data, there is a speed limit of 50 km/h instead of the normal speed of 120 km/h.
Even in the 50-kilometre limit, however, traffic had, in practice, progressed at a pedestrian pace on a Thursday afternoon.
On Thursday afternoon, the roads progressed to the Lake Siilinjärvi in the case of the statue of Ilmestys, or the golden neck.
I can do well without such attention
A 23-year-old runner has had to see the curses of the public.
Amalie Iuel has published fantastic pictures of himself in the landscape of Grand Canyon, among others.
The Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in her current home country of Norway, not least because in March she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record at a stretch of 400 metres by touring the track at the time of 51.81.
One month later he improved the 400-metre fence line at the Norwegian record at 55.38.
Iuel, who is a frequent user of social media, was able to see, shortly after his record, that there is a downside to celebrity and publicity.
Men from all over the world began to send pictures of their sexual life to Iuell, apparently in the hope that the young runner would take an interest in them.
Iuel was forced to close off his Snapchat account.
I got lots of "crash images" from unknown people, so I was forced to turn my account into a private one, Iuel told VG.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to specify exactly what kind of photos he received.
You can probably guess Iuel is laughing.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I can manage well without that kind of other attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is a Dane, the father is a Dane-Norwegian.
The Iuel family moved to Norway when Amalien was 2 years old.
When Amalien was 12 years old, the family moved to Namibia, then to Pakistan, because of their father's work.
It was followed by Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he exchanged Danish citizenship for Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with three trainers, Leif Olaw Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Sltum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches do not ask questions but only issue orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal personally with the athlete, Iuel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records of 400 metres and 400 metres in the brain drain.
Janne Korven's entire career was jeopardised by foot-and-mouth - now it is in the World Cup: 'It's nice not to hurt'.
It has been nice to count now that nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, one of the most successful snowballers in Finland, 31, has once again been able to enjoy his lovely species during this period.
Only last summer, the continuation of a career was at stake.
The strain on the leg table had forced Cork to the surgery table in January, and the foot did not want to heal at all.
He had taken a hand in the raid.
In the summer, I did not know what to do, whether the ferry continued or not.
The Sponsrakis were on the street and a lot of things were open," Korpi says.
But that is how it is said that it is customary to organise things.
The leg improved, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and the blood started to pull back on the chest again.
The decision to proceed was then easy.
I knew that at the latest when I was snowing.
I was that hemmetti, yes this is so fun again, will be pulled through a couple more.
The Korpi did not come down properly until September or October, but after a long downturn it has been a big thing to exercise without pain.
Only a few have been circulating.
It does not matter.
The competitions have never been the most important aspect of the ferry.
I have never fallen because of one race.
But she thinks it is frustrating to aim for four years for one of the games, and then you are in the fever for the week.
I can't think that way,' says Korpi.
Today, the Korpi is holding a race in the halfway yard of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though the individual races do not like him or her on a ferry, in a tough company he is always lit.
According to Korven, the prestige of the International Ski Association Games has increased in recent years, even though some of the ferry operators chose to host the Norwegian X-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important games, visibility is big.
However, in the opinion of the egg, appreciation always depends on the conditions and level of the Games.
Korpi is the oldest athlete of the Finnish 12-strong team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's itching, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korea.
It's nice to follow the young guys.
I remember when I was at the stage where everything was new and was so sick excited about everything.
It brings a new stream for yourself, the Korpi thinks.
I still have some way to go along, but by the way I don't, that's how much is flowing in the guys!
In the background of Lautailu's career, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of Pekka Korven is addicted to a dietary sports: the ferry operator has its own nutrient horses for which he carries out training programmes.
When I am in a hole all the time, there is no more time to be in a mess.
But every day I watch at least the nutrients and usually something slots," says Korpi.
According to Korven, nutrition control and dietary coaching are a potential career plan when the ferry career comes to an end.
I will not go as far as that, but it is at least a probable alternative.
I feel as if I am studying it in addition to snowboarding.
I try to stay on the nerves of the time and develop, in the summer you may be driving something to the slots too.
If it's the future profession of the egg, then it's not difficult to start when you already have inside the species.
The groundwork also includes the Livtloppet restaurant with the host Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship, which will be directed to Stockholm for the Elitloppet competition at the end of May.
The Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
Criminalisation has gone well, and people have been excited.
We have now reached the point that there will be no bankruptcy.
A few months to go, let's hope we can get the ship up and running," says Korpi enthusiastically.
Attendo Hospitality Hospitality Project for Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new nursing home for 41-seated elderly people.
The building of a more than 1 700 deck square metre is expected to be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre's neighbour.
The general question at pain is what the new unit will be like for customers, because now during the war, many private nursing homes are suffering from a lack of customers.
Anne Flink Attendo, regional manager of care services, commented that in the future Kitee will have increased demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better too," says Flink.
Attendo bought a private nursing home for Kanervikkola and Eerika from Kitee last year.
The deal concerned the business, but the real estate is reportedly a five-year lease.
Flink says that Attendo has no acute need to move functions away from these premises.
I'll be back with more on this later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's Scottish factory
The trade union is seeking confirmation from McVitie's inventor's directors of a long-term commitment to production at Glasgow.
According to the Scottish section of GMB, the British General Trade Union, the company has not communicated its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The Hobnobs, Rich Tea and other products manufacturing plant has more than 500 employees.
Pladis, which owns a McVitie's brand, said that it invested over £5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives would "be the first to be told" if changes were to be made.
In a letter to the President, GMB calls on the company "to respond to concerns about the lack of funding for the modernisation of production lines."
The GMB trade union Drew Duffy is deeply concerned that the factory director does not have clear information about the business needs of Tollcross and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and the metropolitan area of Glasgow. The factory is a significant source of employment in a region with high unemployment and low incomes.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, and Brexit, the constantly increasing cost of living and the constant shrinking of production, Glasgow in the East is in dire need of successful McVitie's production."
According to Pladis's spokesman, the factory director had received the trade union letter only the previous day and the company replies directly to the letter because it appreciates the continuous interaction with workers and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with workers and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed a number of issues.
Among other things, we discussed with workers the fact that, like other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain market, we constantly assess all our businesses and offices in order to remain competitive."
According to the reporter, the company has invested over £5 million in the Tollcross factory in recent years, especially in its production lines and in the improvement of its operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a manufacturing plant and we are sure to be the first to inform employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the plant's operations."
Was PSG warning of the transfer of PSG to Barcelona to Neymar three years ago?
LaLiga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up the quest for Neymar after paying a transfer of £189 million to terminate the agreement, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
Censorship is the most talked-about case of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record for transfer amounts. The previous record was less than half as high: it was created when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer of £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's best-paid professional athlete, with PSG providing him with a salary of over GBP 500 000 per week after the tax.
Barcelona is known to be furious about PSG's activities and the way in which Neymar has left the club. A source near Barcelona tells us that Neymar has been very well looked after by the club since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
Did the President of PSG warn the world of football about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned the best players in PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they want our players, we'll become their opponent and we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaif said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they aspire to our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to be guilty of just that: it expressed its interest in Marco Verratt, the middle-airport member of the PSG, earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italians to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar as a result.

NYT: The phones that were sprayed by the Trump were invented - a white house spokesman: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that two of the calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, according to the New York Times.
The telephone calls mounted by Mr Trump with both the President of Mexico and the head of the scout organisation have proved to be invented.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, spokesperson for the White House, confirmed that no calls had been made.
However, he said that Trump did not lie.
According to Sanders, many of the leaders of the scouts spoke to Trump personally, and the Mexican President, Enrique Pena Nieto, had been discussed by Trump at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I would not say that it was a lie, it is a pretty tough accusation.
Those conversations took place, not just in the phone but face to face, Sanders justified.
Speaking to scouts aroused disapproval
On Monday, Mr Trump told us that the President of Mexico phoned him and praised Mr Trump for successfully stamping out illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few will cross the southern border of Mexico any more, because they know that they will in any case be crossing the border with the United States.
On Wednesday, the Mexican Government published an information note in which it said that this call had not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico published a complete version of the Trump interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Mr Trump made his speech at a major meeting of the national scout organisation in Western Virginia.
I got a call from the leader of the scouts, he said it was the finest speech ever given to them.
They were very grateful, Trump told.
On Wednesday, the scout organisation announced that it was unaware of any call from its executive to Trump.
It is reported that the earlier statement by Michael Surbaugh, the head of the organisation, in which he had apologised to Mr Trump for his speech from the scouts, speaks for himself.
Mr Trump's speech at the meeting of the scouting organisation caused a great deal of astonishment, as it was exceptionally political in the nature of the event.
Amongst other things, he glossed over the results of last autumn's presidential elections.
