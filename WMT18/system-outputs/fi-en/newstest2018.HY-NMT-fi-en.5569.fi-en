Camille Auer wanted to fix her gender, was diagnosed as mentally ill and now she is doing art on the subject - "A person should have a right to their own body"
Dozens of patient reports hang from the roof of the Project Room of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts.
Each of them reads Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a multi-year story of how outside people have written up their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell the person about my history of care in order to make the violence of the process visible," Auer says.
In the process he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a period of years of research involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process will begin with the "gender identity disorder" diagnosis studies being conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen he had ordered over the Internet and was well advanced in his own repair process.
She felt she was a woman, but under Finnish law a person has to go through a repair process so that the gender can also be corrected legally.
Translaw, the law on the strengthening of the gender of the transsek veal (563/2002) obliges transgender people to undergo forced sterilisation, so that the right gender is placed in a population register centre and passport.
At the moment, every gender corrector is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of reproductive disability.
It is up to the person to decide on their own body.
"This situation is unacceptable and violates human rights," says Auer.
There has been a long talk in Finland about the reform of translaw.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight comments on the law, and the European Court of Justice is a preliminary ruling which obliges the parties to the ECHR to exercise sovereignty.
Under the guidance of the then Minister for Health and Social Affairs, Susanne Huovinen, the Finnish Government prepared a change to the law.
There were elections and the PerusFinnish people went up to the government.
Now the law change is stuck again.
These are domestic political disputes that are not even related to this law.
"The government does not want to put it on the table because there are differences within the government about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, executive director of Amnesty's Finnish department.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installments.
One of them is the packaging and instructions for the drugs used by Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the psychologist of the University University Hospital of Tampere, Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a report to define Auer's right to care and help.
The sense of the reality to be explored appears to be vulnerable to destabilisation.
The perception of oneself, which is examined, appears to be fragmented at a border level and the unstable features of personality are highlighted.
Auer did not identify himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as a mental illness," Auer said.
The shock was even greater when Auer was not granted gender reassignment treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his identity.
Then, on 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the Transpoli waiting room television apart.
Later, on that television, a work of art was created called Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflexes his experience of power and its use.
"It is crazy that any person who is born to be defined as a woman can aggravate their breast, but you need a diagnosis for breast removal," Auer says.
Your body is not your own if you feel that you are nothing more than a gender defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one.
The gender correction process is more difficult for many mental reasons than purely medical operations.
They go through it and meet dozens of people who have to justify their own existence and right to their own sexual experience.
"It is crazy that people who are in need of support and assistance are denied treatment, citing their lack of resources," Auer said.
Many of those seeking the process have psychological symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
On these grounds, medical staff can determine that treatment cannot be started.
"Preventing treatment and assistance can put people in an even worse situation than it was before the process started," Auer said.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that is something that people usually find difficult to digest."
Depression has been treated with medications and when Auer started using hormones, she was relieved.
She had finally been able to say the feelings that had existed in childhood and in her teens.
Why the broad jaw did not seem to fit into your body and why the breast muscles had to be round instead of flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people near him who see him.
Seeing is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressed, using voice and movements," she says.
Today, Auer already feels like he is coming to see, he is a woman.
However, the random comments by those close to the beginning of the process could hurt a lot.
It hurt the most when the close abusers.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they are not willing or able to digest it," he continues.
But not all trans people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from cardiac dysphoria, or bodycortisol, where the body or its parts can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, there can be no official confirmation of their gender.
"There is no medical justification for these studies," Auer said.
And that is true.
In Denmark, for example, Parliament approved a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex in June 2014.
The new legislation is based on sovereignty over the legal sex.
The adult applicant makes a written application for the new identity card, explaining that he feels he is a different sex.
After six months of reflection, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new personal identification.
This sovereignty is also required for Finland, and this demand also boils down to the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but is a political and artistic collection.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.
Camille Auer's exhibition at the Antiphallic Dick from 4 to 28 July 2017 in the Project Room of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts.
The NGO issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP, which advocates for African-Americans' civil rights, has issued a travel warning for Missouri due to discriminatory practices in the state and racist attacks there.
"The NAACP's travel release for Missouri will enter into force on 28 August 2017 and calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling in a state that has recently released."
The law that recently entered into force in Missouri makes it more difficult for discrimination cases to be brought to court. In addition, the enforcement of state laws is disproportionate to minorities. According to the NAACP, these factors led to a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are stopped on the basis of skin colour and are beaten or killed, "Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP, told the Kansas City Star.
"We have not heard of as many cases in the past in as short a time."
The travel release for Missouri is the organization's first warning to the US state.
The organization cited racist comments made against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of a 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year; he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel. He was arrested by Missouri police, although he was not charged with the crime.
The travel release also referred to a statement by the Missouri Attorney General that the police are 75 percent more likely to stop a black driver than a white driver.
"The purpose of the travel release is to urge people to be vigilant and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to prepare, for example, by taking money to pay for guarantees or telling relatives to go through the state."
According to the FBI, in 2015, one hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri, the sixteenth most in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it more difficult for companies to sue for discrimination in housing and employment relationships.
The ACLU recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after adopting immigration laws requiring police to arrest people for immigration offences. According to the organization, this increases racial profiling.
In general, travel warnings are issued by the State Department and concern other states. Recently, however, NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the executive's supplementary pension
Mika Lintilä, the Business Minister responsible for corporate governance, has asked Finnair for a report on the additional pension contribution received by the airline's chief executive Peter Vauramo, Yle says.
According to the minister, it contradicts the state's expression of desire.
The additional pension of €130,000 received by Vauramo emerged this week when the Helsinki News reported on the remuneration of the executives of listed companies.
Finland's Kulie reported on Vauramo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said he would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has agreed that additional pensions will not be used for rewards.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's corporate governance decision.
The sanctions made the speeches tougher immediately
Not long ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia are on the way from cold to warm.
During the G20 meeting in Hamburg, the US President Donald Trump and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, appeared to be working well with each other.
Since then the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions adopted by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were met with bitter reaction in Russia.
The most provocative response so far has been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who said that the sanctions law signed by Trump amounts to a "full-scale trade war."
Even if the Russian reactions are only signed as political rhetoric and excesses, the heightened tension between the United States and Russia is a fact after a brief honeymoon period after Trump's election.
In the United States, the passage of the sanctions law on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Although Congress approved the law with considerable unanimity, it was reported that it was much more difficult for the President to pass the law.
Trump also criticises his recent signing of the law as "significantly flawed."
President Trump's fist may have been the cause of Russia in particular, although it must have been disgusting to adopt a law restricting its own prerogatives.
As is well known, there is an investigation in the United States of possible Russian interference in the presidential election as well as the Trump campaign's links with Russia.
The tension between the United States and Russia is a fact of life after a short honeymoon period.
When the staff of the White House have changed to the strictest and the various scandal-plagued developments have been revealed almost to update, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States under the President, but in spite of the President.
This situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is a breakthrough in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core Baltic Sea is tightening relations.
The EU has visibly raised the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained at least on the face of its policy towards Russia, its interests are quite different.
For a member country that trades heavily with Russia like Finland, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The effects of the recent US sanctions law are still unclear.
There have been fears in the EU that sanctions will hamper the functioning of many European companies.
In Finland, the impacts may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennopower nuclear project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of liquid natural gas, which is important to the US economy, for example.
Trade sanctions are a way in world politics to show outrage.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought out and watchful.
Otherwise, they will easily do more harm than good.
Is nothing more sacred?
Trump's White House now has a Statue of Liberty in its sights
The absence of statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as everyone else: Iraqis, together with American soldiers, brought down the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologues in the Trump administration, knew well what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty came under attack by Miller in a worded statement about the president's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller did not really criticize the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge herds of cruise organisers and imitating characters from the Statue of Liberty.
His attack targeted the significance of the statue, in particular the fact that in 1903 Emma Lazarus's poem was added to the statue's leg - 17 years after the statue was completed.
That is how Miller lambasted Acosta: "I do not want to go into it more specifically in history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that is enlightening the whole world.
The poem was added later and does not belong to the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller himself was not wrong, but it is not just history, as he himself said.
The key is Lazarus's touching words, the only ones of which the state does not call only immigrants, but "the poorest of the poor ":" your tired, your poor,/your huddrefled masses over.
The poem is more topical than ever.
By no means did Miller pursue literary criticism. He made it clear that the "poorest" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The dispute over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural dispute over the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus's friends campaigned for the poem to be put on the statue's feet, knowing full well that it was a political act.
The purpose of the statue was to reflect the links between French and American republicanism with a classic metaphor, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female character is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the deported.
Linking the poem to the image was an ingenious feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationhood.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into original.
Rush Limbaugh - a plotter who can now be seen as some kind of prediction from Trump - claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone to go ahead: it is a neo-conservative
He takes the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not show the way to the United States. "
Unusually, Limbaugh was partly right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on perspective.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the ship's deck after a long and hard journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people seeking protection and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty is comforted by hope and welcome.
And that is absolutely not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torch does not show the way, but stirs the flames of anger, their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots entered the British national team
Neil Black, executive director of the British Athletics Federation, says that 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the world championships are a "significant confirmation."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
According to Black, there is "something special" happening in Scotland that British athletics must learn from.
"This is welcome and we will continue to study it for so long that we understand what is at stake," Black said.
"I talked to representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute and they thought it was related to the activities of the Institute.
The Scottish Athletics Association, on the other hand, believes that it is related to the activities of the league,
And the British Athletics Association believes it is behind their actions.
And the usual street builder thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it is something very powerful, whatever the reason. "
Many Scottish athletes are competing seriously in London for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who are competing with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000 metres race. Eilidh Doyle, meanwhile, was elected captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredible, "Black said.
"The athletes left the event proud of their achievements and were strongly motivated, regardless of where they happen to live and train.
Eilidh's words had a real sense of passion and passion for sport. "
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medallist at the Commonwealth Championships in the 400 metres hurdles, and these are his fifth World Championships. He thinks it is "incredible" that the national team has 16 Scots.
The previous record was seven in 1983 and 2015.
The average distance runner Laura Muir has run five British and two European records in the year.
He competes in London at 1500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare is running 1500 metres in London, and it is worth keeping an eye on him too: a man has an excellent season, including victories in the World Cup and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scot in the national team to join him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "immensely proud" of having so many Scots, some of whom are serious about competing for finals and medals.
"Being a captain is a great honour anyway, but even more so because the members of the national team voted for the captain," Doyle said.
"I am obviously very proud of all the Scots who came into the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes competing for prizes.
My captain's speech?
I think it went quite well.
I focused on how lucky we are to have home games.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and to be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere will be crazy. "
Preventing critics on Facebook: do not stand for public office if you cannot withstand criticism
The father of our country knew what bad publicity is.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began criticising him for all possible domestic politics, always for his political principles.
The criticism was certainly annoyed,
But he did not silence his critics.
"If the freedom of speech is removed, we may be led as stupid and silent as sheep being slaughtered," Washington said in 1783.
That brings us to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has deleted at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked them.
The American Civil Rights Union sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considers the challenge unfounded, and the attitude was dismissive on the web.
"What difference? That is just Facebook," many commented.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of a state controlled by Democrats.
He has received the second best estimates among the top 50 governors.
Hogan is not responsive to the hot.
He has steered the state firmly and held firm to the principles.
He has also been able to use Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents, and has published a picture of the person who has undergone chemotherapy.
Therefore, preventing users from accessing the Governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax money.
Hogan spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions in an interview with The Washington Post. He said it was just a matter of modernizing comments.
However, branding commentators as trolls, snubs or enemies is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their chosen leaders. They were not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They told us that their comments were respectful, considerate and factual.
The pastor quoted a Bible in his comments; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland Bowie was not hostile but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I commented politely to my disappointment that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in remarks reported by The Washington Post.
"I also find it unacceptable that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately regarded as an organised group and dismissed as a large group of worried citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments "a concerted attack." Someone else could call them important in order to promote what they consider important.
In the age of Facebook, it is easy to manage communication by blocking a critic or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to gather and burn newspapers with critical editorial papers, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But it is really the same thing, now it is just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision on the issue was made last week in Virginia.
According to Alexandria District Court Judge James C. Cacheris, the government of Loudouni County violated the U.S. Constitution's first addition by blocking the voter on Facebook.
And the American Civil Rights Union held talks with the Republican Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin, about using Twitter and Facebook.
This should not be difficult.
At Washington time, cheap mail charges had a similar effect to the Internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous authors hammered Washington.
Even then there were trolleys.
The names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters in the newspapers barking at Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticizing the Jay Agreement, the cooperation, trade and shipping agreement between the United States and Britain. This is reflected in documents collected by the Papers of George Washington online project.
But he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the foundation stones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
It is right to stop feeding birds in summer
Samples have come from about half a dozen locations, and also online notifications from a couple, three.
Some of them have come from South and Varsinais-Finland, but then also from the individual Haapavedelt and the River Seine, the special investigator, Berry Isomursu, says.
The green pews have died of a brilliance called trikomonosi.
It is caused by the early animal known as Trichomonas Gallinae.
It has been known to hit pigeons in the past, and in particular the problem.
In the 21st century, however, the disease began to be detected from peppolins.
In 2009, it got right.
Then the trikomonoosi caused a big meltdown in the green stock in Finland, after which the species' stocks have been recovering.
There have now been sick green peppers, but not on a big scale at least, Juha Honkala, director of the Natural History Museum at the University of Helsinki, says.
It is to be feared that the previous outbreak of green chips will be repeated again unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: stop the summer feeding of birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field advantage at Renaissance Club
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field advantage over the next three days, with the Renaissance Club in East Lothians holding 25. The Senior Open in Scotland.
The Northern Irishman Rafferty led last year's tournament at Archerfield Links next door before the final round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is fond of a new location and acts as an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of the club's founder and chief executive, Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club and this event will bring it to its full glory," Rafferty said.
"The players see the pitch at its best. It is in great shape.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He is an enthusiastic ambassador for the game and he is proud of his achievements here.
The tournament is a fantastic showroom for this field. "
The Englishman Eales is defending the championship for the first time, despite having won a 32-year career on both the European Tour and the European Challenger Tour.
"This really feels like a special occasion," the Southport player said.
"I was unable to defend my victory at Extremadura Open because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It is great to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to mind: the tournament victory was a wonderful thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember. "
Gary Orr returns to action on his own soil. He went on tour after completing 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing at home is always more relevant than usual," Orr, who lives in Helensburgh, says.
"You want to succeed but you also feel extra pressure.
I have enjoyed playing again and played pretty strongly.
I am happy with my game so far. "
The trio will be joined on the field by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior majors winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark James.
Six Scots will participate in the tournament: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Free entry to the tournament. Car parking costs £5 if there is only a driver in the car, and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
In the village of Sälä, a barracks was cleared of possible internal air problems
In the village of Pori, the media company of the Pori Brigade barracks has not yet found any indoor problems, the brigade was told on Thursday.
Indoor aerial surveys continue.
The reports began when a man who interrupted his garrison service for health reasons thought his health had deteriorated due to poor indoor conditions in the barracks.
According to Mika Holman, the Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, there have been no problems with the health of the other servicemen.
It turned out that it was an isolated incident, and no health problems have occurred for those who served in the unit.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to explain this in detail.
It is not currently known that we have any indoor air problems, Holma says.
The brigade's release says that due to the July arrival instalment, the barracks have had to be moved, which is why the dust may have increased temporarily.
It may have made the air stale, Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold country
Bardina Degei does not use loving cooking.
He uses the boiler only rarely.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in Indonesia's troubled province of Papua. When he prepares for dinner, he usually puts the bathat - locally "nota" - directly into his fireplace.
After half an hour, the sweet potato burnt to the cart is eaten with bare, unwashed hands.
There are no furniture in Deg's home. He sits on a muddy paint, where he usually also carries out his daily tasks, such as washing the laundry in the same-haired water from a nearby marsh.
The toilet office is supplied by a bucket in the roof room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives and has not been assigned to run the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot. The soldiers must also be taken into account.
"Nobody dares walk in the village after five nights," Degei says.
This is a rare strangulation in everyday life in the Papua Highlands, the former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. The annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 villages were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement opposed to Dutch rule quickly turned its anger on the Jakarta government, which keeps the region firmly in control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is aloof and knock. The journey begins with an hour and a half flight from the provincial capital, Jayapura Nabire, and continues with the stomach crawling for five hours on board the rental car.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 residents has wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, whose corrugated tin roofs have been dyed clockwise.
Only a few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papua Mee Pago tribes worship the Uga Tamee god.
There have been other changes.
"We did not have such clothes," Degei says. He means colourful, hand-woven with his boiling headgear, dark hats and bright colors.
"Before, we only had magazines covering our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold country.
Paniai is roughly the size of New Jersey, with 153,000 inhabitants. Only about 100 kilometres from Pania is Grasberg, the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, which is home to Phoenix in the United States.
In 2015, Freeport generated $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has estimated wood reserves of $78 billion.
But for the beans, these riches bring misery, because they mean the repressive presence of a strong Indonesian army.
The New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and the Army's local units between 1998 and 2004. Individual officers were paid up to $150,000.
Papua's demands for greater autonomy threaten this source of income and are ruthlessly silenced.
Human rights activists say that since 1969, the Indonesian military has killed more than 500,000 beans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacres in the Papua tribal highlands in the 1970s were genocide.
Last year, more than 3,900 people were arrested by Indonesian police in peaceful demonstrations.
In the Brisbane Archdiocese's report We Will Lose Everything from 2016 there are reports of atrocities in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly popular demonstrations - and relentless violent.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because there are cases every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been tightened as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants are Christian, but the demographics are changing as the populous Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi migrate to the region in search of better livelihood.
Java warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetables in a peanut sauce.
It is difficult for the local to compete.
"The migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market more cheaply than the local ones," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Pania and moved to the provincial capital to follow the work.
"Local women lost their customers."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo - nicknamed Jokowi - promised in his 2014 election campaign to tackle Papua's injustices and human rights abuses.
Papua is made up of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, during his trip to Jakarta's presidential palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were shattered because we voted for Jokow in 2014 and expected him to fulfil our hopes and restore justice," You said.
Paniai experienced something of a wave just two months after Jokow's October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs at a drawing in Enarotal on 7 December 2014 when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use the headlights.
One of the soldiers did not like the remark. According to Yavedt Tebain, a local pastor, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to reports from victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers captured the children and assaulted them with rifle beats.
Thus one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of the assault.
A couple of hours later, the building of the State Electoral Commission, located near the scene, was set alight, and the next day started to happen.
Around a thousand beans - young men and women, as well as children - gathered in the football field in front of a local police station and an army command centre to demand justice.
They had a string of trophies for festive spending, and they started performing the traditional Waita dance of the Papua Mee Pago tribe, dancing in rings and playing a bird song.
Some of the protesters started to stone police and army buildings.
When the atmosphere was heating up, the soldiers were told by the internal radio system: "if the crowds are resisting more than three times, shoot them dead." The information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine, which has not been made public to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, a Kego Koto resident, foresaw the situation spiralling out of control and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
Nobody wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist," she told Time magazine with a whisper of her bright coloured wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who shot him, but the bullet came from the military ranks.
"Several shots were fired at the crowd."
Alfius Youw was shot three times. His cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," Yohanes told Time magazine in a sorry state. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I screamed at him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that the police only "protected" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"Then it is about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The day after the killings were reported to Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered an emotional speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising that the Papua violence would be addressed.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that it never happens again."
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would launch investigations into human rights abuses outside the legal system.
But he immediately began to withdraw his speech.
"Most of the violations took place a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the infringements, but we need certain processes, "he said.
In an interview with Time magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he did not intend to start investigations in Papua.
"Everything will be sorted out in court," he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity." The crimes are related to the death of more than a thousand people during the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told Time magazine that there have already been 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including Paniai.
The families of the Paniai victims are in grim disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," Yohanes says.
"I am already tired of this."
He says he is still living in fear, even though the event has been around for years.
"Yes, I am afraid," he says.
"I am afraid the army will arrest me. I am afraid I will be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Paniaists do not dare discuss the event.
He says that the soldiers had abused him when he had helped bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me in their hands after the burial of the victims," he said.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighbouring region of Paniai in Deiyai.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between villagers and the head of a construction company that started when the leader refused to take the man who lost consciousness to hospital. The injured included children.
The man who needed hospital treatment was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been on the water while fishing in a nearby river. He died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site before the company's office.
According to police, villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
According to local reports, however, a mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, leaving one villager dead.
"We are terrified. We are afraid of retribution," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought into care.
"I have been hiding at home for two days."
Deiyai's parliament has called for shots to be fired at police officers and the withdrawal of a moving police unit from the area.
Paniai has always been a sticking point for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development is fuelling discontent among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes that live in the central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the beans through random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are Panic, like Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the insurgency by arresting and arbitrarily imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some of those arrested will never return.
Among the beans, Paniai is known as a "sad, forgotten place."
Poverty breeds discontent.
Only a little rice is sold in Enarotal, and that is too expensive for the local,
Like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly batates and some fruit and vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five bathroom fields.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the rest is sold in the square.
Ten batats cost only 10,000 rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the livelihoods of locals and migrants have increased and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened at Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs and they usually go to better educated and wealthier local migrants.
Only a few beans have enough capital and expertise to run their own company competitively.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village because there is neither work nor money," says John Gobai, president of the Paniai tribal council.
The remote region of Papua is being neglected in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news are still tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basil Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been granted a rare permit. The official cause was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
Human Rights Watch's deputy head of Asia, Phelim Kinen, said Jokowi has not kept his election promises. He has neither increased transparency nor promoted development by removing restrictions on coverage.
"Journalists from the troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua have new risks: denying visas and being blacklisted," Kine said in a statement.
The lack of press freedom means that the Indonesian government is only putting pressure on Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua's "numerous and widespread violations."
Traditionally, these states have also supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the accusations and told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to hide the evidence of human rights violations."
Local governments want foreign governments to intervene.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights envoy Kees Van Baarin, visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, telling an anonymous source.
Indonesia has a presidential election in 2019, but the Peppers say they are no longer likely to vote for Jokow.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who are implicated in the Paniai shooting scene," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Paniaians: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army and in poverty, virtually without access to health care and education.
According to Gobain, the Paniaists, like the rest of the beans, see their votes to Jokow as a "debt," which must be repaid.
"They do not want money. They just want justice," he said.
Despite threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Paniai shooting attack once again demonstrated their resistance in a symbolic fashion: they buried one of the victims in a police station and an army outpost on opposite ground.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says in the paintings.
"What else could we do?"
Dereck Chisora bemoans the cancellation of Robert Helenius's latest match: "even your own fans do not want to see"
The heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to play on 27 May at Hartwall Arena.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
Chisora, in a recent interview with IFL TV, blows the blame for the latest match being completely flopped on Helenius.
My match in Finland flopped, but it was not my fault.
I do not live in Finland, I do not want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans do not want to see him grip because he is miserable, Chisora blunts.
Helenius and Chisora first met at the full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial dot.
Ticket sales for the latest match went assiduously, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Evening News in May that the match had been postponed until the autumn.
There is nothing new about the match.
However, the cancellation no longer annoys Chisora.
The match would probably have had to be cancelled after Chisora's illness.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I was in severe pain.
My hernia was exploding.
The hospital said I had to be cut, Chisora says.
The Briton says he is currently in about 45 percent condition.
He is not, by all accounts, interested in the latest match with Helenius, but Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss to Whyte in December with a split.
Fire stormed another Torch skyscraper in Dubai
The flames stormed the world's highest residence building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee the 79-storey building 337 metres high.
This was the second fire in two years in a building called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied and no one is known to have been injured. The cause of the fire was unknown immediately after the incident.
"We were sleeping and woke up with the fire alarms and people's cries.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes, "George told Reuters.
According to Dubai rescue officials, the fire was extinguished at 4 a.m. local time and left to cool the building.
The government said it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case may raise questions again about the safety of materials used at high prices outside buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Board of Torch Building commissioned a study which found that the disk used for facade curtains and insulation suffered the most damage.
In Britain, police believe that the insulation and curtains of London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid progress of the flames in the fire which killed 80 people in June.
Moped was stolen overnight from a booby car park
The moped was stolen from a booby car park between 9 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Tuesday.
The moped disappeared from the Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
The moped was from his label Sky Team Monkey.
The colour is red, and the registration number is 27-REV.
The moped was found later Thursday.
The police ask for observations of the moped or its grab by email to address this email address is protected from spambots.
You need JavaScript support to see it. Or by phone to call police on 0295 415 320.
Edited at 12.40 p.m. on 3 August 2017, the police informed us that the moped was found.
In the US, more than 20% of air passengers take banned items on board, survey reveals
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unwittingly exported prohibited items to aircraft over US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints. At least 6% of passengers had knives or other items with steel that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent said they had only learned afterwards that they had mistakenly transported weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey involved more than 1,000 passengers and was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules.
19.7% of passengers who knowingly breached TSA rules were members of Generation Y and less than 15% belonged to the X generation.
Most commonly, the rules were broken by taking food and liquids onto the plane.
More than 3% admitted that they deliberately took items with steel on the plane. In addition, 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men said they knowingly took banned drugs on board the plane.
Passengers from all over the United States participated in the survey. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many people had taken the contraband by mistake over the security check and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that those who travel most are also most likely to carry out a security check - knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that conducted the survey says, the TSA guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids can be exported and how much.
So it is no surprise that most of the TSA seizures are liquids.
For some time there was also a thought that books should not be taken on board a plane.
Liquids may be exported for domestic flights but not for international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his decision to delay decisions made during Obama's term to reduce emissions
A day after 15 states sued Scott Pruitt, head of the EPA's Environmental Protection Agency, Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the Obama administration's executive decisions to reduce smog emissions.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he heads is taking more account of the needs of environmental policy makers in the State.
Pruitt did not mention a word about the action that had been brought against his previous decision by a federal appeals court.
The Länder should start to comply with the standards for ground-level ozone from 1 October 2015.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions by one year to allow his agency more time to study the plan because the agency "does not want to interfere in local decision-making or hinder economic growth."
Pruitt was a public prosecutor in Oklahoma State before he was appointed President Donald Trump's director of the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to block or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback for Pruitt's plan to ease regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA director exceeded his authority in trying to delay the Obama administration's decision on oil and gas companies. The decision obliged companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement on Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his U-turn on the ozone regulations would only strengthen EPA's cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements as scheduled.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to take it to court to reach an agreement on timetables," Pruitt said. In his previous action, he sued the Environmental Agency more than ten times.
"We do not believe in litigation and take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation of our operations and its powers to us. "
However, the EPA's statement said that Pruitt can continue to use "his powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader change in the ozone regulations.
The bill adopted last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, head of the New York State Public Prosecutor's Office, who sued the EPA this week, said that the group intends to keep up the pressure.
"The EPA's change of mind as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6.7 million newYorkers and over 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities."
In addition to New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Orica,
Ground-level ozone occurs when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The smog this way can cause severe breathing difficulties for vulnerable groups of people, which is also a factor in thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists welcomed Pruitt's surprising change of direction.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required to make sense of the guy who was responsible for our breathing," says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration, because its ideological aim is to act on the terms of polluters and other vested interests."
From the supercar manufacturer to the street - "takes place in Ferrari style"
It will also invest in hybrid sports cars, while also trying to maintain its exclusive position.
That is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said at a news briefing on the plans on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News reported.
All East Savo measles cases with the same type of virus
Rantasalme measles is the same type of virus as previous cases in East Savo, reports THL.
The Estonian laboratory at the Institute of Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in East Savo is the same strain of the virus with previous infections.
THL has ensured that the measles infection confirmed on Friday 28 July by a person with a placebo is the same type of virus as previous cases in East Savo.
On the basis of this information, all infections found in East Savo are linked to the first measles vaccine found in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not seen other types of measles.
However, it is possible that new infections from the fifth sufferer may occur until mid-August, and the outbreak is not over, says Soster's Primary Care Infectious Diseases doctor Mirkaleena Erkena.
No new measles infections or suspicions have emerged since the fifth confirmed case.
It is still important, however, that everyone takes care of the timeliness of their own vaccination, Erkkilä recalls.
More about: in Pirkanmaa, three new measles infections were confirmed - "additional infections or epidemics very unlikely"
Finland prepares for licensed operation
It was not even considered to be legalised.
The underlying argument is that the process, along with the spirits, produces methanol, which is toxic.
The manufacture of the spotted at home is legal next year, but the legalisation of the hooked soup is not even considered.
The spotted is made by fermentation, the pontiff distilled again.
The rationale behind the regulation of distillation is that, along with the spirits, the process produces methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to make a vigorous soup a right to roam, the government counsel, Ismo Thomas, commented on the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the alcohol law, the pontiff distillation was not considered legalised.
It was not brought to the political table either.
There was no discussion about the release of distillation, "Outi Mäkelä (Kok.) said.
He is in the negotiating crowd of the parliamentary groups of the governing parties who took a stand on the reform of the alcohol law.
You will not even be able to grant permission for a vigorous distillation at home.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain licensed.
Import says that the domestic production of alcoholic beverages becomes a simple rule: alcohol can be manufactured at home by fermentation.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, the home can be legally spotted.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements for flavourings and flavourings and makes it possible to manufacture a spoil, Mäkelä explains.
The manufacture must still take place in such a way that the raw materials, or the flavourings and flavourings created when they are used, are clearly visible.
Under the new law, drinks can be produced as much as they like, and alcohol can be given as a gift from homeowners.
It must still not be put on sale.
Being spotted in Finland is no longer a public health problem, Thomas believes.
A much bigger change occurred in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The alcohol law will come before Parliament as soon as the September period begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the parliament has already taken a stand, Mäkelä welcomes.
Oscar Pistorius chased to hospital by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered chest pain, was admitted to a South African hospital with heart attack injuries.
Pistorius has already got out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence in Atteridgeville prison.
According to the British Mirror newspaper, Pistorius was taken from prison this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered chest pains, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to a hospital for investigation.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family said that the former top athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced six times the Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Flat telephone conversations reveal Trump's pressure on Mexico to build border wall
Telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders have leaked to The Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on 27 January 2017, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop making his public remarks about not paying the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States called Nieto for having shot down the wall project in public. "You cannot say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at Mexico's expense.
The Washington Post also published a statement about Trump's first phone call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. There was a tense exchange during the call.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement to take US refugees on their way to Australia is "ridiculous," "pathetic" and "stupid." According to Trump, the agreement negotiated during Obama's term would make him look "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on resettling refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the call by saying to Turnbull, "This was the most unpleasant call of all day."
Georgia massacre: activists staged a racist lynching in the hope of justice
The Ford Mercury car overtakes the crowd in the small town of Monroe in the Georgia countryside and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
The car has four black passengers and a white driver. Four armed men are blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the group, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped dress, takes a deep breath of cigars and tires through the windscreen.
Passengers are afraid.
"Roger, n---u!" The man screams.
"Out of the car!"
The cries break in silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this tragic event is only a reshuffle, presented on 22 July 2017.
The sighs of the shock are genuine, however, when the noose is dragged into Roger's neck.
Since 2005, human rights groups have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to stave off the events of 1946. At the time, the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been prosecuted for murder.
"It is baffling that no one has been arrested over these years - even though the murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the restructuring.
"It is a blot of history, but above all it is a burden that weighs on our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia congressman.
For him, the reshuffle is a startling invitation to action. It also reminds the Monroe people that wrongdoing has never been corrected.
"We want the culprits to be brought to justice. We want things to finally come to an end, and we want to recover from the grief and reconcile, but above all we want justice," Brooks said.
"We cannot recover and reconcile until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of the victim who died in the Georgia massacre on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI documents obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men were suspected of lynching from Monroe and the surrounding district.
But no one was charged with murder.
Although the culprits have been free for decades, according to activists, the motives behind the lynching have always been known to local people: politics and sex.
In 1946, black people in the state of Georgia were allowed to vote for the first time in presidential elections by a Supreme Court decision. The Supreme Court issued its ruling in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident at the time of the election in which a black landlord, Roger Malcom, was stabbed by white landowner Barnett Hester in fights apparently involving Mr Malcoma.
According to Brooks, there were rumours that Hester had been in a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting a baby.
According to FBI records, the influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid $600 for Malcom's bail on 25 July 1946 against which he was released from prison.
On their way home, Malcom and Dorothy were their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and organised the murders," the FBI statement said.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities. The authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
"It was a murder of the right to vote," he said.
"They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to the black people that they would do the same if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been guiding the restaging of the massacre in Georgia for almost a decade.
The motion is extremely realistic and imprison. It is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from today's United States.
It is difficult to look at the motion, but it is even harder not to see what Greene says is the intention.
"We do not want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our dark sides as well," says the director.
"But I cannot have a relationship with you if you do not hear me or you do not want to hear what I have been through."
This year's performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors - a dozen black and twenty white - gathered to listen to Greene's stunned summary of the motion.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's deputy director.
He has been presenting the local Ku Klux Klan leader for years, but the role is always equally difficult and disgusting.
"Get dirty because I am not myself," Marbaugh says.
"It is important, however, that this side of history should be raised so that it never happens again."
On the other side of the room are Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The presentation begins with a scene where Malcom shouts and kicks Hester. He is furious that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothy.
"Did you not hear? I said go away from my bat, n---u!"
Rascona, or Hester, replies.
Then leave the handle.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) will burst into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!" Rascona asks.
He is confused.
"Did I accidentally get too firm?" He asks.
"No," Greene sneaks.
"I just do not think the whites used the word n---u at that time."
"So," another black actor confirms.
"It is jargon. You have to use a longer version."
The subject of the motion is uncomfortable, but the room is dominated by a guy.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the sake of the motion. They want to respect the memory of those killed.
The scene starts from the beginning.
Now Rascona's words swine.
Nobody laughs.
The reshuffle stops quickly and violently.
Scream, shots - and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress stands beside the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice is shattered by every other word.
A few dozen or so viewers sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost half of the audience is black and half white.
There are couples who have come to see Ithaca from New York State, but most are local.
They have visited the graves of the victims, under pressure from Georgia, under the guidance of Brooks.
The murders have turned the story into reality. The atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song, Greene calls the crowd to inspect the bodies.
The children are tearing up to watch the artificial blood and immobile corpses and whispering to each other.
"They are not really dead," the little boy mutters as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes Greene thanks the audience.
The cast members of the lynchmen strip of their sign and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then burst into tears after a tough performance.
"Do not worry," the woman involved in the motion takes comfort.
"We know you are not him.
You did this for good reason. "
Later, the audience and actors will meet for a joint dinner.
The white couple who have arrived from Altanta are discussing the proposal with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinsk finds it hard to find words when she describes the feelings that the motion arouses.
"It is hard to listen to horrible words and watch terrible deeds that are said and done by people who look the same as you - just because they look the same as you," he says.
"It made me realize that lynchings are still happening," he added. "They are just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recounts the development of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning next year's proposal.
"Re-staging is a powerful experience, because it describes the horrors we experience, but it is also a learning experience," Brooks said.
"The message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it. "
Hanging vegetables in the shops is an emotion: removing this amount of 'extra parts' actually saves you
Is it permissible to remove cauliflower leaves in the shop before weighing in?
What about taking a big hat out of the pineapple - that is how much?
The answers are strongly divided: for one, it is a sign of extreme nunity, while others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that are not used and which go home in rubbish.
The phenomenon is recognised in shops.
For example, cardboard boxes can be found in the vegetable department of Ruoholahu K-Citymarket in Helsinki, because many are ripped off, for example, by the kale press.
From the box, newspapers are exported to trade in bio-waste.
According to a news release from the message, sniping at the vegetable counter surprises traders.
But how much does removing extra parts of vegetables before weighing up really save money?
How important is it really?
We women test how the price changes when the pineapple, latva artichoke, mushroom, broccoli and cauliflower take leaves or heels away.
Cauliflower: the price of a cauliflower costing €2.10 came to €1.80, with all the leaves shell out of it.
Pineapple: the price of an entire pineapple costing €2.30 fell to €1.95 when the stock wrestled away.
Latva artichoke: the price of EUR 2.60 came to EUR 2.40, while the short stock was turned off.
Mushroom: two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price came to 60 cents.
Broccoli: the average broccoli cost 1 euro and the stock is 80 cents.
The end result: if you jump out of newspapers and stocks, save a few dozen cents for one of the vegetables at best.
In percentage terms, the price of vegetables dropped by up to 20%.
It would have saved a total of €1.20!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - Brassitstar entered into a five-year contract with PSG
The Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, the AFP news agency reports.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid the exiting price of EUR 222 million for FC Barcelona playing in the Spanish league.
The dramatic transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the biggest in football history.
Earlier, the record was set by Manchester United, who paid €105 million last summer for the Frenchman Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league slowed the move earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neymar's representatives' first payment attempt.
Under league rules, a buying club cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his contract, which is done by recycling money through the league.
In practice, PSG have paid a sum to Neymar and his representatives who provided the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will potentially be presented to a new home audience at the opening of PSG's season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa examines the details
In addition, Barcelona said in its release that it would provide information on the payment to Uefa, the European Football Association, so that the league can determine any disciplinary action that may arise from the incident.
Spanish Premier Javier Tebas, among others, has suspected PSG of violating the rules of Uefa's financial fair play by spending their money.
UEFA can punish the club, which makes over 30 million euros in losses over three years.
Uefa says Neymar's transfer does not automatically violate its financial article.
Neymar's transfer to PSG will affect the club's finances for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed beforehand.
PSG may, for example, sell a number of players in large quantities, Uefa was informed.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatar company Qatar Sports Investment.

Austin, 21, had severe burns from lightning attack - flaring on the airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing ordinary work on a plane at the international airport in Lounas-Florida with a couple of colleagues when a plane was struck by lightning from the wet sky.
The lightning power threw the plane close to Dunn's ground.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and said his brother got an electric shock and he is in the hospital.
But I asked if he was alive, Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks sick.
In addition to burns, he had muscle damage and bleeding in the brain.
The experience was tough for the whole family.
No such thing can wait.
It is traumatising for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport spokesman, the lightning risk warning system was in place at the time of the incident and the transport business itself decides whether to comply.
Pearson to cut 3,000 jobs and revive business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British education group Pearson announced that it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut its dividend by 72%, starting with a new restructuring programme in response to pressure on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job cuts will mainly be made at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, which already cut 4,000 jobs in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that he would cut costs again by £300 million in May as part of his third savings programme, which aims to revive a weakened business as a result of the rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell his share of the Penguin Random House publishing house to his partner, Bertelsmann. The company said it would maintain its outlook for the current year. Its turnover increased by 1% in the first half of the year and was £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
The suicide bomber struck a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul. According to the authorities, a NATO soldier was killed and several others were wounded.
According to a NATO statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in Kabul's Qarabagh region.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month. On Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bomber attack on the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to a NATO statement, the Thursday evening explosion occurred when a joint NATO and Afghan army patrol was attacked by a "person carrying a self-contained explosive device."
The statement said that all the injured were in stable condition and were being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say that the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are major concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, a region predominantly populated by Shi'ite Muslims.
The Taliban declared themselves behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in the centre of Kabul, the country's deadliest militant faction attack since US-led forces toppled the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the volatile situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether to send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies and in particular President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay implementation of smog regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, reversed its decision to delay the implementation of decisions made during the Obama administration to reduce smog emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision late Wednesday on the implementation of the so-called "ozone control" for 2015. The agency says the decision is a sign of its commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states," Scott Pruitt, the agency's director, said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone control for one year to October 2018. According to the definitions, smog pollution is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 predominantly Democratic states, including District of Columbia. They said it was illegal to delay the implementation.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to ease environmental regulations during Barack Obama's time. According to Trump, the measures are part of a broader economic growth agenda.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who worry about the health effects of the increase in emissions.
According to the EPA's website, inhaling ozone without breathing "can weaken lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a leading figure in ISIS had also sent bomb building parts to Sydney.
There were suspicions that the bomb was to be taken to a plane on 15 July, but the attempt was interrupted before the security check.
The police would not specify why the company was interrupted.
Another of the suspected terrorists' plans was to build a toxic fuel-efficient accelerator and take the device to a crowded public place, for example a public transport facility.
Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans Australia has ever made.
Because of suspected terrorist plans, four men were captured in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continuing.
Liquid CEO: renewable fuels were doing well
Oil refiner Neste's profit before tax fell, but beat forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company achieved a good result in petroleum products, sales volumes of renewable products rose to record highs and Marketing & Services' profit trend was in the right direction.
Last year's comparable profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax break.
According to Lievonen, profits from renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax break ended.
Our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and our growth projects and will complete our previously announced strategic investments in 2017, Lievonen said in a press release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatchenko discuss possible match at first meeting
Vasyl Lomatchenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of the series under 66.7 kilos, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel's offices in Los Angeles until WBC's invincible lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked along the corridor to greet Lomensshenta.
Garcia won at Showtime on Saturday with the unanimous decision of former world weight class champion Adrien Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomatchenko have been in the top five on a comparative list of different weight boxers.
Garcia stretched his right hand and asked, "How is it, Master?
Good luck with the match! "
Lomatchenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN Channel Seven on Saturday.
When the couple spotted the photographer, Egis Klimas, the manager of Lomatshenko, pointed out that the match between the men would be "perfect in terms of size."
"I am a former feather singer," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up to the top [63.5 kilograms] for Broner, but I am not that big.
I am a small size 63.5-kilogram.
I want back to the lightweight.
He has to step up to the light series [61.2 kilograms]. Then we can play.
That is what our fans are hoping for.
Meet their wishes. "
Lomatchenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this match."
Klimas asked if the match should be arranged on a payment channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomatchenko that Lomatchenko debuted in a lightweight later this year and matches Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout victories) next summer. Garcia would also be interested to face the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will play in the lightweight series at Forum on 23 September.
"The match could be on the payment channel because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later announcing he was ready to match the channel offering the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
Nobody else gets as much attention.
As soon as agreement is reached... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomatshenko as an "incredible outcast" and he may be going to watch Saturday's match.
Lomatshenko interrupted his praise for Garcia's year and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "really slow. Sori, Mike... but you needed the knockout."
Garcia said he focused first on showing the power of attack and then boxing.
The men said they felt that the match between them was to take place more and more.
"This is the match that is expected.
No other match generates as much attention and interest.
I am definitely involved in this case, "Garcia said.
Lomatchenko said he expected to be able to match the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It will be a great match. "
Average salary of €5,300, training what happens - investment advice was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot recently.
Most recently, Helsingin Sanomaa told Ritva, 68, to whom the banker's investment advice spoke utter nonsense when selling investment products.
The rules on investment advisers and various sales of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The tightening is based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
The current assessment of the skills of investment advisers and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not specify the requirements for excellence.
The Financial Sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service carry out their own APV1 or APV2 studies.
The financial sector has authorized the organisation of qualifications for firms called APV Investment Oy, whose examination team sits with experts from both the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry.
The qualifications are between 12 and 15 studies, and their exams are prepared by wave EE, a wave of business management development services provided by University Executive Education Oy.
Its Web site reports that, overall, both exams are "quite extensive in terms of requirements."
The learning materials for qualifications include 10 to 15 books, as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Exploration Oy, says that roughly 70 exams have passed through.
Of the big banks' staff, roughly all those offering investment services have completed either APV1 or APV2, because they are mandatory according to the companies' own rules.
Then there are the smaller bankers, without mentioning the names of the staff who appear to have mapped out their qualifications, Clay says.
He says there are "a few" bankers.
According to Savikon, the APV1 graduate has reached between 13,000 and 14,000 people since 2000 and the APV2 studies recommended to investment advisers are more demanding.
Some bankers think graduating is an advantage.
More other industries have significantly stricter skills requirements.
Clay says that the Financial Industry Recommendation requires APV qualifications to be completed, because that is where the investment expertise is guaranteed.
According to the Central Statistics Office, financial and investment advisers earn on average several thousand euros a month, including kickbacks, benefits and performance bonuses.
The average monthly regular working hours is about €5,300.
On average, men who work in positions earn just over €5,900 a month and women earn more than €4,500.
A tenth of those earning the most on average earns about €8 100.
A tenth of the men earning the highest earns more than €9,000 a month or more, a tenth of the women earning the most are earning €6,400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
Until now, the level of employee and job has relied on self-regulation.
According to Fivan, the audit received individual cases where the adviser's professionalism and competence were not sufficient on the basis of the adviser's activities.
You can also, in principle, be a salesman of investment products, even if you have a level of professionalism and competence.
Basically, the situation has been wild and free.
More other industries have significantly stricter skills requirements, "says Savikko.
Since the beginning of next year, according to Savikon, this will be tightened with the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II).
It requires each company to be responsible for ensuring that the staff providing the investment services are sufficiently skilled.
Financial supervision, for its part, is empowered to determine what to know.
Marko Court, Fivan's market supervisor, says that one of the clear changes to the current law is a regulation on the skills and experience of investment advisers and investment managers.
According to the court, the new requirements apply to both the investment firms' own staff and the untied agents who sell the products on behalf of a company.
The court says that according to a government statement issued by the Treasury, Fiva has the power to determine knowledge and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided by these perspectives in the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, monitoring and further training.
All this needs to be documented, and the company has an obligation to show that this has also been done.
The court specifies that, in practice, the company must, for example, identify the individual person's actions.
This will certainly be subject to different standards, depending on whether it is investment advice or product sales.
According to the court, it is also a new requirement to work on a deadline with someone more experienced if knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
In other words, if a company pays a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain time.
According to the court, the change will make the rules tougher and more concrete.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
Photo: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane 'drawn' a giant plane over the United States
The plane's flying route was etched over the United States by Flightradar24.
The flight was carried out on Thursday by the 787 Dreamliner, with Boeing testing the sustainability of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane, which left Seattle for 18 hours and 1 minute, flew a distance of 15,700 km, longer than any permanent commercial flight in the world.
The flight remained within the borders of the United States all the way.
It flew through 17 states.
Imatra's tenacious beach schoolchildren are not unimpressed by the rain or the roaster of the sun - with the help of the bathtub of Iines Everenen Polski
Iines Everenen went well, followed by Taina Itkonen.
Imatra's beach schools run on Lietta and Lempuka this week and next.
Although it rains and then shines again, the young swimmers are not, too, boasts Taina Itkonen, the head of the swimming school.
This week's swimming schools will have a total of 13 children, up from a dozen next week.
Itkonen's assessment of the number of children in the coming week was influenced by the fact that the school and the escalator are already starting.
The Imatra Beach School is organised in cooperation with the Sikunta Unite project and the city of Imatra.
On Thursday, Lietta was in a nice mood.
The sun was shining and the young swimming school children were working on the surface to stay with the swimming sticks, someone even without them.
Smaller siblings were also comfortable in the water.
Iines Everything, 5, first thought about going deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged her to trample towards the beach.
Well done!
Iines told me he had been swimming a lot this summer.
The beach is good for him.
Like Iines Everything, the swimming buttons were strenuous with Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too can be satisfied with today's achievements, the Swimsuit praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, wanted a water war between them.
Her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, who followed her swimming from the beach, Ilona Villberg considers the beach school a good start for swimming lessons.
Even though the weather has been hurting, Anna has walked out here every day.
Sometimes you had to be warm.
The swimming school children packed the quay.
The boys had enough business with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg rolled over the pier towel, grabbing the fruit and basking in the day.
In the water, the teaching continued, but there was no hurry on the quay.
One when it is not summer.
An unidentified soldier sells a toilet - "This is a unifying story"
You see it all kind of.
A couple of days ago, Sinituote, which produces cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product series.
So the damp and laundry kits - and the "toilet toothbrush with the lining crest."
The unknown soldier refers to the film premiere this autumn and the marketing of the leffa.
Yet there is something special in the mix, and the products have been ironed out on social media: when will the health ties with Tuntemato come?
You have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määtä, deputy CEO of Sinitute say?
We are a partner in the film.
We are supporting this film, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, Määtä says.
According to him, the products come with special performances, and the film will be visible.
Is there not something funny about this - often when you think that products and stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, there is such a unifying story that we are a Finnish player and these are Finnish products, Määtä says.
He says that the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are supported by those who have seen the old unknown soldier.
And cleaning up is not alien to army culture, Määtä points out.
Other business partners in the unknown military film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall Vichy has been placed on the market with names like Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Tuntemato's products have already been cancelled by Kalle Kinnunen, the Finnish blogger for Kuvallee
Coffee and clocks are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the film premiere, so there is still a way to go.
Unknown partners have not yet revealed their war products, for example, Valio, Noble, Neste and German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
Results of new age tests for Swedish asylum seekers announced
The latest results of medical age tests for Swedish asylum seekers have been announced. The results of tests carried out under the new evaluation method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were identified as over 18 years old. However, not everyone thinks the tests are reliable.
The Swedish National Medicine Agency began testing earlier this year.
The tests can assess the age of an asylum seeker more closely than before, and the new test was introduced after the Swedish immigration agency was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of applicants claiming to be minors.
So far, the Agency has carried out 6,880 tests, and the forensic science agency has now published 2,481 results. The tests were conducted between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
80% of those tested, or 2002, were determined to be over 18 years old. In addition, the forensic agency determined in 25 cases that the test was "possibly 18 years old or older."
In 432 cases it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under 18 years old."
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to doubt the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson from the forensic science agency says that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are quite uniform. There is no noticeable difference in the statistics of previous months," he told The Local.
Although a large number of applicants were identified as being over 18 years old, this does not necessarily mean that the applicants have lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and declared that in 442 cases there were "indications that the investigation is 18 years old or older."
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it emerged that in 243 cases the applicant had openly told her that he would be 18 years old this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of knees. Then dentists and radiologists analyse the images. The method has also been criticised.
One of the doubters is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity. The assessment can determine whether the person has become puberty earlier than usual or later.
"I have had reason to think about it and I do not think the method used is the right one.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot determine the age, we should not pretend that we can do it, "he told the Metro newspaper.
However, the forensic science agency Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests: "in general it can be said that the risk of determining a child as an adult is low.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test will soon take 18 years. Then the risk will be about 10 percent. "
Ilonen collapsed to 30 seats in Scotland
Five over-par results in the third round spent 30 articles on Mikko Ilose in a profit slip down in the European Tour golf competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left No. 11 on Saturday, but was found to share 41 at the end of the round.
Ilose accumulated one double bogey in a difficult angel.
It was also difficult.
Ian Poulter, an Englishman, rose to share the top spot in one of the under-par rounds, even though he said that there was enough work in the umbrella.
Angel was brutal, but I was hanging on and in the end the day was good, Poulter was full.
She shares the lead with her compatriot Callum Shinkwin and Andrew Dodd, an Australian.
West Virginia governor to change party
Democratic Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia announced at a Trump campaign event on Thursday night that he would change the party.
"The Democrats simply rejected me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and in-depth reflection... Today I tell the people of West Virginia that I can no longer help you as a Democrat governor."
The audience broke out to loud applause.
"The Republican Party registered tomorrow," the Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say to you, it is time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that a major announcement would be made at a campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Mr Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Mr Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited from his father a mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement saying, "Governor Justice's party change is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is building barriers rather than better America."
"Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership and is unable to find a positive message," RNC spokesman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Lightning caused damage - Thursday becoming even summer's very thunderstorm day
There will also be more thunderstorms in southern Finland at the end of the week.
During the past week there has been a thunderstorm, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Finnish.
On the night of Wednesday and Thursday, several fires were set by lightning strikes.
According to meteorologists, Thursday may be a very thunderous day for the summer so far.
The thunderstorm has finally found Finland too.
During the past week, there has been lightning, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Finnish.
The lightning struck the terraced house at the electrical centre, causing a small fire.
The emergency services received notification about the fire about a quarter to midnight on Wednesday.
The electricity centre was located in the sauna at the end of the terraced house.
The rescue service dismantled the roof and wall to find the fire spots and put out the fire in a nutshell.
Eleven homes were left without electricity in total, but personal damage was avoided.
While in Loima, lightning set the external building ablaze on Harjulant Road before midnight.
When the rescue service arrived, the building was already in full fire and the rescue service could only prevent the fire from spreading.
An external building of about fifty square metres burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio, the lightning struck the house.
The residents were outside the building and witnessed a flaring lightning strike.
The rescue agency was there to review the case, but this time the lightning did not come out of the fire - only a few melts were hit.
In traffic, the thunderstorm caused problems on the train line between the River Seine and Vaasa, when the lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
On Thursday morning, between eight and nine of the affected trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was only rectified shortly before five in the afternoon.
Since then, train traffic has been able to continue normally on the thunderstorm runway.
Lightning has wreaked havoc across Finland.
However, the level of secrecy has been relatively low this summer.
This summer's thunderstorm cases have been absolutely crumbling!
Wednesday and Thursday's thunderstorms have been mainly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low lightning season in the summer, it feels even more intense.
This might seem like a really tough thunderstorm, but that is what it has been compared to this summer's thunderstorm, "Tuovinen said.
On Wednesday, there were 1,700 fixtures, and Thursday had the potential for even the hardest thunderstorm of the summer: by about 16 o'clock, there were 1,790 terrain in Plakkaro.
If the lightning continues into the early evening, more than two thousand lightning could be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record low thunderstorm year was experienced in 2015, when the lightning number for the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning had reached 18 386 lightning stations.
So there is still catching up to ensure that this year does not break the "record" of two years ago.
But Ukkskirin can expect to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will also remain warm and wet during the rest of the week, which is a suitable native environment for thunder.
The main focus of the thunderstorms will be on Saturday from the northern parts of the country to the south, where some 2,000 lightning days can be reached on Saturday and Sunday.
In the central part of the country there will be a more uniform level of rain.
According to Tuovinen, such a thunderstorm can only depart.
Coe praises Russia's' open-minded 'apology for doping scandal
World Athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised the apology he described as unapologetic, which Russia issued following the doping scandal on Thursday. However, Coe added that it was not yet time to end Russia's ban on participation.
Russian athletics director Dmitry Shljahtin said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday, on the eve of the World Cup, that the Russian ban was appropriate and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry "for all the athletes who were taken to the competition for a gold or silver medal."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to extend the ban. Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015 after evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia was presented in the WADA report.
"I think his response today was very direct. It was a very open statement," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Federation admitted that the country was going through difficult times and said that it would do everything possible to reorganise its activities."
Coe said he was "also pleased" that Russia accepted the terms of the lifting of the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendation that this is not the time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
"In the coming months we must do everything we can to normalise the situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes are competing with neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday, which have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
The head of the IAAF working group, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet many requirements before its status could be restored.
"The testing is still inadequate and the coaches who have been banned continue to operate freely," he told reporters on Friday after a presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
Production company disappointed by poor success of Tom Of Finland film
Tom of Finland did not have the kind of success that the authors had hoped, says Yle.
Let's be honest, I am disappointed to admit that the film was produced by Annika Sucksdorff Yle, CEO of Helsinki Film.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it looks like it is.
The film premiere in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached just over 100,000 viewers, which is a little compared to the film's budget of about EUR 5 million.
Nothing came out of this lottery, but now it is important that investors get their own back.
If the film had been better at home, they would have already had their money.
Now you have to wait for small streams of foreign distribution, Sucksdorff said.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoske.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The restrictive rules governing the use of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's transfer from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germaini in France. This is the most expensive transfer of all football players.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Gerreputation (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
UEFA introduced fair play rules in 2011, according to which PSG must be able to prove that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid €222 million to terminate the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's annual salary in the new company moves in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France has many economic aspects.
PSG will have no trouble paying Neymar's transfer amount and linking him to his star guard, as it will be followed by financing the Qatar oil enriched government.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums on buying players, but they need to be balanced with real sources of income, so that the football business is not loss-making.
The Financial Rules of Fair Play were drawn up at the initiative of Michel Platini, the French elected president of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini took the view that the pursuit of success through debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of Fair Play's financial rules shifted from clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in Chelsea in 2003 was severely hampered. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player purchases and created a global brand.
The current three-year review period for financial rules for fair play lasts until 2018. During that period, clubs will be allowed to make a loss of up to 30 million euros.
Although Platini was forced to leave the role of UEFA president in a scandal in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Cefer, also wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
"The rules of fair play are still in place and we will continue to apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, responsible for financial rules at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a lump sum, it can manage the amount in the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual sum of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
The first sanctions were imposed in 2014 on the basis of financial rules of fair play. The biggest sanctions were imposed on Manchester City, financed by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million. In addition, the club was ordered to restrict its Champions League group to 21 players for the season instead of the usual 25 players for the season.
Uefa is monitoring clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their revenue through companies linked to club owners.
If, for example, a Qatar company supports PSG, but the value of the support is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, UEFA will not count as the actual income.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the Qatari Tourism Authority's support for PSG was overmatched.
It has also emerged that some of Neymar's earnings at PSG could be funded by payments from the organising committee for the 2022 football World Cup in Qatar.
However, PSG and the organising committee have denied that Neymar would be the ambassador for the World Championships. Uefa would find it very easy to disclose such an arrangement.
Because of previous PSG sanctions, UEFA will follow the companies around the rules more closely.
Sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG the transfer of Neymar.
The sources gave the interview to the Associated Press news agency on condition that their identity is not disclosed because they are not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
According to the most recent financial statements, the turnover of PSG for the 2015-2016 period was €542.4 million and a profit of more than €10 million.
Last season's financial statements have not yet been made public.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of club products and game shirts.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with Neymar's contract.
Clearly vexed by the departure of the best player in the world, the Spanish league tried to hamper Neymar's transfer, which was alleged to be in breach of the financial rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state," Spanish Premier Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS. In the state he referred to PSG's Qatar ownership.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state funding the football club. Arsenal is owned by an American sports magnate.
"This case is the result of ownership, which has changed the football environment completely over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the financial rules of fair play. There are so many interests connected with the fact that the famous player represents the state. "
Hurry now: Finland's World Cup athletes' coach stranded in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahden and triple jumper Christina Mäkelä's coach Suren Ghazaryan is stranded in Helsinki, although she should prepare for the World Athletics Championships in London.
Christina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in the shortlist for the long jump and Mäkelä on Saturday in the triple jump shortlist.
However, the coach of the couple, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to handle the matter unsuccessfully in the British broadcast.
The coach has an invitation from the World Cup organisers as a documentary, but that is not good enough to get a visa.
I wonder whether the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, Jorma Kemppainen, the training director, said.
He has always managed the visa business himself successfully in the past, but now has some problems.
He does everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Federation Sulu for years.
It is not so important.
As long as someone looks at the stadium for steps to be taken, Arttu Pajulahti said about the possible departure of his coach.
World Cup medal from Finland to London requires a miracle
The World Athletics Championships start in London on Friday and last just over a week, ending on Sunday 13 August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and hockey are the species that Finnish bench athletes manage to be passionate about year after year, be it success or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course there are other indicators.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one set of games to another, where the experience of acquiring an athlete matures to a level that is genuinely possible for an adult World Cup medal.
Now there are no young athletes in Finland's small World Cup team, and there are no chores.
The World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the attractiveness and surprise of the sport is that it can happen.
It will draw bench athletes to the television screen and the glue to watch the games, even though the London medals will only be resolved by late afternoon due to the time difference.
During the previous World Cup of Athletics 2015, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by the spear shooter Tero Pitkämäki.
The dads are expecting a medal from Long Hill even now, even though the recent results of his and other cast members and the loss of Long Hill in last summer's qualifying games.
Whatever happens in these games, Long Hill will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes, entering the final or making their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt for Finnish athletics in the years to come will give a good success in the youth international qualifying games this summer.
Training young talent and financial support for its work is more important than maintaining a small elite of representative athletes.
Success does not come overnight, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience, both in training and on the bench.
The Finns also appreciate the international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully, the London Games will go down in history as the games of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not for example because of the deterrence of terrorism or cowardly attacks.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But I regret"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has been located in the second big air race in Colorado, the United States.
Copper Mountain's second place is Rukajärvi's best big air at the World Cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the contest.
He tried his last jump caballerial 1080 for the first time in the games, and it was very close to succeeding.
It feels good and it is a good filibuster now, but I do regret that the last jump did not quite go.
Yes, I am going to try it again from now on in the games, Rye Lake.
In Big Aair, a snowboarding competitor jumps on a jump for the species.
Viking Line's new fast ship stuck in the port in Helsinki
The shipping company Viking's new FSTR is long overdue.
The fast ship had to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 18: 00.
The ship was loaded in eight countries.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
At least an hour and a half I have been waiting to get on the ship.
Now the car queue is moving slightly, Johannes Rebane, an Estonian who is waiting at the port of Helsinki, said at 7.30.
Rebane thought it had become a technical fault.
Rebane said that the shipping company had brought water bottles to the ship for those waiting in their cars.
Christa Grönlund, the head of communications for Viking, tells IS that there was a technical fault.
It was repaired in Helsinki port.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Greenland says that the ship will also be delayed by a few hours from Tallinn's return trip.
The ship had to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 20.15.

A small circle of nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story harks back to the days of the characters' 80s glory and the '90s grunge (at that time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great deal of The State sketch sister MTV) and their time
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant remembrance we have stuck with in the Facebook age.
As a commercial product, it seems to have been a while.
The First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humour (among other things, it told the story of a vegetable cans speaking in H. Jon Benjamin's voice).
At the heart of the joke is that middle-aged actors play coveted teenagers approaching full age, and highlighting it makes the impossibility of reaching the past a joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it is parodied, for example, by '90s stalker cliffs, like a horror movie.
At one point, one of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skaters and "The other stuff of 1991."
Many of the stories are the same as in the past.
The Good Heart Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has still not got over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And there is a mad plot involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Michael Showalter) as his accomplice George H. W. Bush (played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best are the side paths.
It is especially fun to see the ancient Paul Rudd, who has a bearded razor under his lower lips, Matt Dillon's "soul patch" film Singles. Andy, the kingi of the camp, played by Rudd, is starting to be old.
The moments of random madness may put this series on the air as a kind of repulsive Seven Up! Until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer - Twenty Years in its final scene, a group of friends goes to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series again calls for another kind of nostalgia: the Americans' Cold War spirit, the Atomic Blonde movie, and even the GLOW wrestling picture.
The comedy series was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and is directed by Rhys Thomas. It has been made a Romanian police drama of the 1980s, in which a Bucharest cop fights for truth, atheism and Marksism-Leninism.
Gregorina and Iosefina, who are hardwired in the main parts, are seen as Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their speeches have been dubanded in English by Channing Tatum (the series's main producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It is a great idea,
But that is not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (the police spend time watching chess on television in the same way that the Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous audio actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny. Their bonding gets a fun game.
Comrade Detective, however, is caught up too much in the imitation of a clumsy socialist drama - involving, for example, the killer hiding behind the Reagan mask. That is why the series often starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
The six long episodes are too long, and the comedy of the series is not fast enough and not plentiful.
To sum up, the series might be better served as an agitproof satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men at the entrance.
The message to the imagined communist public is that Western culture can make everything consumer and fast food.
The fictitious Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: our greed as a refuge of our own recent history and their history.
Toni Tauru, a Koula native, will be in the ring in Macau on Saturday - facing former UFC hosts
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match going.
Toni Tauru will be up against a tough bone in Macau, as the Brazilian Leandro Issa was still in the UFC last year.
Brazil also has a black belt and a world championship.
For once, I match myself against the older one.
It is a funny thing, 32-year-old Tauru says.
He had to get up in the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three fixtures were reached in the Chinese autonomous region of Macau.
Tauru has not faced such a thing before.
This was the first time that my match was cancelled.
It was annoyed, because preparation and training took a lot of time.
However, the mother-of-two is pleased that a new date was set for the struggle.
The wait of the week has little impact on the preparation.
The move will not make a difference because it will not improve in a week.
The condition can get worse if you are training too much now.
In a few previous battles, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths lie in erecting.
This time the situation is different.
Issaa Kouvola describes as a typical Brazilian.
He is quite aggressive.
I bet he will be hard on the first one and try to take the carpet.
He has won the World Championship, so he can wrestle.
The previous match at the school did not go as planned.
Filipino Kevin Belingon hit Tauru badly in the eye, and the victory left the Philippines.
I have never done so well, especially standing up: he did not get any hits.
When I went down, he hit my eye.
It was annoying for a very long time.
New motivation
Some of the vacationers grip once a year, some rise in frequency.
For example, the next opponent, Issa, last played in September.
Tauru, meanwhile, had three matches last year.
Now there is another battle this year.
Sometimes the pace has become heavy.
In recent years I have been working and been in good shape all the time.
But I have only been through the match.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoo and got back to work.
We got some really good stuff from one guy in Sweden.
The training was a great help, because on Saturday the schoolteacher will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I have had to work against opponents of the same size and practice match fixing.
Standing still is the 32-year-old's main tactic.
You have to be sensible.
If there is an opportunity, I am going to take the land myself.
You must not give them for free, because they consume the most.
Macau attracts the Tauru, who has been in China before.
It is said to be China's Las Vegas.
I think there is a big and great evening ahead.
Bank of England keeps rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged, while economic growth has been weak and the relaxation of inflation has put an end to speculation about interest rate hikes.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to slow. The bank postponed interest rate hikes because the income level of families is under increasing pressure.
The central bank's monetary policy committee decided by 6 votes to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%. This month the rate hike won even less support because economic growth has been weak.
In its quarterly inflation review, the Bank lowered its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and its 2018 forecast to 1.6%. It also warned that household incomes are under increasing pressure because inflation is expected to continue to accelerate to close to 3% in the autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rate hikes will be needed in the next few years to curb Brexit's rate hike. In addition, the Bank announced that borrowing costs could have to be increased more than expected in financial markets.
In addition, the members of the Commission decided to withdraw part of the massive financial package that began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The bank will close the Term Funding Scheme programme in February 2018, although it is expected to provide £15 million more in favourable funding to banks through the current programme, totalling £115 million.
The Bank's interest rate decision protocol states: "according to the Monetary Policy Commission's forecast, the slow trend in gross domestic product will continue over the next few years as the fall in real household income reduces consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated that in order to curb inflation, a "degree of tightening" of monetary policy is needed to "slightly increase market expectations."
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be "gradual" and "limited."
In May, the Bank forecast 1.9% growth for this year and 1.7% growth for next year.
It now maintains its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Against the dollar, the pound weakened by 0.5% and was at $1.31. Against the euro, it weakened by 0.4% and was at €1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was taken after weaker than expected growth rates dampened expectations of increased interest rate hikes. GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter and by 0.2% in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its most recent inflation survey gave little hope to households suffering from spiralling inflation and meagre wage increases. According to the Bank, the situation will get worse before it gets better.
The bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" a fall in revenue in the next few years. However, it expects wage growth to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be boosted by strong growth in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound. It repeals part of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was made a year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25% following a shock vote in the EU referendum which plunged the pound into a fall.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to begin to appear on prices and the economy only after four years.
Before the central bank's latest decision, interest rate hikes had started to be called for more and more loudly, as inflation increased pressure on households. In July, three policymakers called for a 0.5% hike.
Inflation retreated last month to 2.6% from 2.9% in June. However, according to the Bank, it was expected and inflation will increase again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the excess over its 2% target was due to a "completely weak pound."
"Given the recent fall in swaps interest rates, competition in the mortgage market would appear to be increasing as lenders are frenetic about seeking customers and want to end the year strongly," says Coreco Mortgage
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. The latest contracts are becoming more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also unaffordable alternatives."
NHS prescribes 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
From September, patients can be prescribed an "inverse" anti-HIV drug. The High Court brought to an end a dispute over the funding of the medicine in the NHS in England.
The NHS said that pre-exposure prevention treatment (PrEP) was prescribed to about 10,000 people during the first three-year experiment. Prior to intercourse, the drug has been found to reduce the risk of infection by about 86 percent among high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld last year's ruling. It says the NHS is able to pay for the PREP drug, even though it claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, leader of the NHS in England, called the decision announced on Thursday a "major new intervention," and described it as a "crucial moment."
Sex health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to receive registrations for an experiment that will expand in October to other clinics. The experiment will reach its full extent in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention therapy (PrEP) is an HIV-positive drug that reduces the risk of infection before intercourse.
Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV infections in at-risk groups.
A drug to be taken prior to intercourse means that the body has enough drugs during intercourse to prevent HIV infection.
You can take the medicine every day or two hours before sex.
Gay men, bisexual men, transgender people and people with HIV-positive partners who do not receive effective treatment are the target group for treatment.
Clinics select applicants who meet the conditions for the experiment from men, women and transgender people and those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for his illness.
People living in England and registered for general medical treatment can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs £10 million and the NHS in England signed a contract for medicines this week following an international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of the PREP drug by gathering extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and implementing treatment.
"This major new intervention should complement and enhance the diverse and increasingly effective ways of preventing HIV that already exist," says Stevens.
"It is yet another significant achievement in the battle that has been going on for more than 30 years to solve one of humanity's biggest health challenges."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Organization.
"If the PrEP medication is correctly targeted at those who need it and at risk groups, it can have a transformative effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, those at risk receive a medicine funded by the NHS which they can decide independently without having to negotiate with a partner, which will have a powerful effect on improving the lives of very many people.
This was welcome news. "
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and no one at risk is excluded," says Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP drug used in the experiment has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of at-risk people from HIV infection."
"The launch of the PREP experiment is a welcome event that dragged on needlessly for several months because of the government's slowness," says shadow health minister Sharon Hodgson.
"We have evidence that the medicine can have a transformative effect on our work to prevent HIV and to stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible throughout the country. In this way, we can protect those who are exposed to HIV and get another step closer to the situation where HIV has been halted in society. "
Quality of living: the intermediate floor and smart furniture solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker keen on renovating the property, moved to a smaller flat in Earl's Court in Knightsbridge in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of the Queen Anna era style house. The success of the renovation shows that Joanne has not yet packed her campuses and changed her.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in a much larger apartment in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something similar in my price category.
I went to the apartment here and found that the rooms were as high as in my apartment at the time.
I loved it straight away and made an offer on the same day. "
Since then, about 90 square homes have undergone a complete transformation.
It was a two-bedroom with only a kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space as well as an intermediate floor to make use of the apartment height.
"I wanted space, large windows and lots of light.
They were my demands, "he said.
He hired Erfan Azadin from the Duck & Shed planning office in Notting Hill. Erfan was instructed to take advantage of the space of nearly four metres high rooms and create an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sale but a home.
The height of the room was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor with standing room.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"The steel structures are quite complex.
The facilities had to be arranged in overlap so that they do not have to be teared.
The structures had to be shaped so that the height is suitable both on and below. "
Erfan was able to relocate the space with two full tall rooms, with fascinating details.
In the middle floor, a copper circus window of Retrouvius opens into an elegant residence.
The Peilikultainen furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage lighting create a distinctive style.
Using mirrors brings theatricality, space feel and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor will make the corridor appear longer than real.
The mirror in the kitchen is like a window that opens into the other room.
The mirrored furniture at the entrance has a storage room for Joanne's attire and glasses.
More elegance is the fact that the kitchen gets hidden when it is not used.
Kitchens with Taitto are not a new solution,
But it is unique in Joanne's kitchen that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of planning," Erfan says of the steel reinforced nagging MDF door.
"It is balanced, that is, it slides very easily into place."
With sensible farm use and storage space planning, Joanne got 16 extra square feet, another bedroom and a better bottom.
"When selling a home, the area counts - or the property valuation," Erfan said.
"In the basic case, the estate agent walks in and out of the apartment and drops the price on the ground."
In Joanne's flat, the surface area was increased using quality materials that bring luxury to the state.
"The resident comes into contact with the materials in the apartment, and the emotional bond in the apartment is created partly on that basis," Erfan said.
"No one draws on the power lines on the walls.
They are important, but not in the same way. "
Joanne's flat is an example of the fact that good planning and additional creatures can make the basic housing exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.

He breeds us with a fresh chilli
In the summer of 1996, a stalls appeared in Lahti Square selling Thai food.
They did not dare to taste, but walked past.
In the stalls, the food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among the familiar Panja.
He did not know much about Finnish, and the Finns did not know the Thai at that time.
Because the people did not dare to eat, Panja offered free tasting.
In this way, he taught the lawns to eat Thai food, spring wrapping at a time.
From countries, he said.
I stayed on the lake hook.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997 Panja opened his Thai hall in Lahti.
There were two small tables, I think there were less than 20.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a ventilator.
If you are hungry and have limited seats, you cannot leave the seat between yourself and the guest.
Slowly we got to know better and became friends.
In the end, I sat down with the dictionary to learn thaikiel.
Two years went by the side of the shopping hall, but then the restaurant had to change, because the spices themselves made would reportedly smell too much in the hall.
A new location was released from the end of the trading hall.
There is room.
Now we jurors will be able to sit again at our tables, only in the most congested times will we be shy to ask strangers if there is room next door.
Panja knows his client.
He is told about belonging, where he has been going and who he has seen.
He knows what food each eat.
He has seen how the customer's life stages vary and the food club changes.
He remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring snakes.
She remembers me as lean and obese, and remembers what I was young.
It is nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit next to the kitchen door of my own place and change your belonging to Panja who is on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with fresh chili sauce.
He has opened our sense of taste and our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many people talk to him about thai - thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he has been difficult, he is always friendly.
He is hard-working.
On top of the restaurant work, he goes in mushrooms and black.
Last week, the restaurant was quietly celebrating two decades.
We customers got a strawberry cake for dessert.
Without any fuss or attention, it took a great day to work.
The discovery of an underground base revealed 173 ISIS terrorists who were ready to strike in Europe
At the beginning of the year, the security authorities had a major agenda for counter-terrorism work.
The list includes more than 170 ISIS fighters ready to attack Europe.
According to Die Welt, a German magazine, there are 173 people and the document includes not only their personal data but also pictures of each.
More than 130 of those mentioned in the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Ilta-Sanomaa reported on the list and a few weeks back.
Now the list's place of discovery and the information it contains are more precise.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi Army Special Forces found the terrorist's personal details and images in a list of their investigations at the terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
The US intelligence officials assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The underlying fear was that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists following the defeat of ISIS in the East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and images of all individuals, but also their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the country of origin of the person.
The list also specifies terrorist specialities.
For example, Sami J., a German 27-year-old on the list, reads Abu Assid al-Almani, a German.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012, travelling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later via Turkey to join the ranks of ISIS.
A suicide bomber has been written beside his image as a specialist.
There is no more details about the man's fate.
Some 6,000 fighters have left the ranks of ISIS in Europe, whose fate is not certain.
Man plunged below the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
According to interviews with the rescue agency, the man had wanted to show that he was able to swim.
A bucket can save a drowning life.
In Tokoinranta, Helsinki, a person was rescued under water on Thursday.
According to Dennis Estlander, the fire fighter in Helsinki's rescue service, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found under water about 15 minutes after the announcement.
A rescue diver found him under the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue service received a notification after half past four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered into the hands of emergency care.
Estlander says it was about 50 years old.
According to the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Mrs Estlander commended the authorities' cooperation with the border guards and the police.
It was a mission led by the border guards.
The divers also provided excellent guidance to the divers.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water along with the border guard and the police.
Two cars collided in Eura - nine people in cars, three seriously injured
A total of nine people were in the car, the rest of whom had less severe injuries, says the fire master.
The injured include both men and women.
The accident happened at the intersection of three roads at four days.
The crash happened when one car turned from behind a warning triangle to another car, says the fire master.
According to the rescue agency, there is an 80 km/h limit at the intersection.
Brothers fight over $500 million in property assets
Two brothers argue over Victoria's largest property empire, worth more than $500 million. The dispute relates to a family business founded 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Former Carlton Football Club president and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Toorak Value area just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the dispute to the Supreme Court over the division of property and business property between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the difference.
The brothers and their mother Anna jointly owned 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family started to accumulate property when they bought the shop on Collingwood's Smith Street in 1973.
The family set up a Westco Jeans shop there, which expanded into a chain of 160 shops.
The chain sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrenton and homes in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and suburban shopping centres.
According to the agreement reached with the family's late father, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul about one-third of the company's assets. Paul describes his father as a "family power and central figure."
According to court documents, the distribution ratio means that Colin owns properties worth about $316 million and Paul about $176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best real estate for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first affidavit to Justice in 2015.
The case was dealt with last Friday for the first time by the Supreme Court after several mediation attempts.
The brothers are now also arguing over who governs the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has ruled him out of business.
Colin says the claim is not true. He blames Paul for mismanagement of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first sworn testimonies that he would like to find a solution.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, the family is the most important to me," Colin said in a statement.
The costs of the case are constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of sounding statements, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consultants such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who set up milk bars and gourmet shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswich.
They were used as collateral to buy a property from Collingwood, where Colin founded the family's first denim shop.
Colin says he founded the shop "in the last years of high school, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to move the property to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often said that he does not want the brothers to end up in court," she writes in her statement.
The family's two other sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in De Lutis Group's business. According to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "bitter about the economic conditions of their departure."
Colin has kept a low profile, despite being a former board member of the Australian Football League club and the television star Eddie McGuire's best friend, according to his 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutisi and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied. He said in his text message that he could not comment properly because it is being dealt with in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take me to court and drag our family to a legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way," Colin continued, saying he still hoped that a solution would be found.
On Friday, hope seemed to be exhausted.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to Poltico, the new White House chief of staff intends to restrict President Trump's media use and news monitoring so that the boss does not get into trouble so often.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reports:
"When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, was meeting with management staff on his first day in office, he addressed a key problem he is going to solve: he is going to limit President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told the White House employees that all information - both printed and in briefings - must go through him because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information. "
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has a relationship with television for decades - and as President he still watches a lot of television.
"If the presidential candidate was nervous about unfair coverage, it was worth showing him that sympathetic media dealt with things more fairly," Sam Nunberg, a Trump campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri, a Politico journalist, wrote at the time that "according to the six former campaign workers, it is essential that Trump's use of Twitter is controlled by a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
But it is ridiculous to say that Trump's use of Twitter has never been controlled.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something the rest of us do not know - maybe Trump's tweets would have been even more furious without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump did not send.
If even a few times his staff have been able to prevent him from causing problems, their work has not been in vain.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing a stir.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are rival groups in the White House who are trying to push their case by giving Trump information that supports their view. That information can be reliable - or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers deliberately give the president questionable information.
The journalist, Shane Goldmacher, reported one incident:
"Trump's current and former employees say that he can be hugely infuriated by newspaper clips that criticise him - especially if they report harmful leaks. Then he will be forced to know where the data came from.
It happened at the end of February when someone jokingly gave the president a copy of the news on the GotNews.com website, which was set up by online provocateur Charles C. Johnson.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment and had previously spread false allegations and subsequently withdrawn them, and he did not provide specific evidence.
Nevertheless, after reading the story, Trump had started asking staff about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and the White House staff secretary, Rob Porter, had "tried to introduce a system of managing documents for Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly tries the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive himself and his aides are still pursuing their own affairs.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's task very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG
The Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, the AFP news agency reports.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid the exiting price of EUR 222 million for FC Barcelona playing in the Spanish league.
Neymar's agreement with Barcelona had therefore been terminated and he was free to move to the Paris club PSG.
The dramatic transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the biggest in football history.
Earlier, the record was set by Manchester United, who paid €105 million last summer for the Frenchman Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatar company Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former tennis professional, Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
The successful writer Raija Orane tackled alcoholism and fear of flight with hypnosis: "I am in my life"
On the TV series, Rose's time and the famous white lakanas of the successful writer Raija Oranen just celebrated his 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren keep their mums in their grip, along with writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their houses, but now the spring also left the rented house.
In light and in the sun, away from the old circles, Raijan took a time of depression and alcoholism from which he survived.
The external character is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were mood drugs.
For alcoholism, I got help from hypnosis at the time, which did the trick for fear of flying, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes people, the crushing author says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Orane have been on the same journey for more than 45 years.
I can do better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who worked in the tourism industry, have been together for more than 40 years.
I did, and it was married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That is the kind of drama the Queen has always been, has stopped her life from that, Jyrki laughs at her wife.
Oranen, a great writer, remembers only a good 44-part series of white flag-draped TV series, which touched and moved during the depressed Finland.
I finally decided to work for Raikka's family of firms in the clothing industry when I read the 50-year interview with Alice Seppälä on the plane.
I was the daughter of a seizure, my mother also had a clothing business and I sometimes acted as a mannequin, Orane remembered.
The plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns to entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and thesis revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives an active time as an author, she has many manuscripts to work on - hundreds of ideas.
Travellers returned to ditch over 'millionaires' alley
The wealthiest house owners in the West Midlands are once again blocking out with persistent evaders who managed to cross the much-needed ditch and return to the adjacent fields of their houses.
Around 20 caravans parked near the street called Millionaires Alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to overrun the moat fence needed for the municipality's marches. They brought with them children, horses and the army of vans.
The travellers managed to cross the barrier at the point which had not been protected due to the path.
Infuriated residents have accused Solihull's municipality of "total inability to solve the problem."
A resident who remained anonymous says that on Monday evening, the travellers came from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown stones at passers-by.
"It is hard for the municipality to act because it seems completely incapable of solving the problem.
The travellers were here in May, then they went away and returned again.
There were more of them in the evening and probably even more today. "
The resident said that Birmingham municipality had solved the problem by denying access to parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road and it is frustrating to pay local tax when the municipality is unable to do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the travellers returned so soon after they were driven out.
"There are more of them than before and they have even dropped the horse to graze the park."
According to a spokesman for Solihulli municipality, the municipality is aware of the illegal campsite near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with Solihull police to evict the campsite as soon as possible.
In order to gather evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible notify the police of disturbing or criminal activity.
It helps to create an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings. "
Outraged people surrounded the plane crash in Portugal
In Portugal, men who have been forced to exile on a beach full of people have been questioned in court today.
Two people died as a result of the forced landing yesterday.
Two men flying the plane may be charged with manslaughter.
In Portugal, the longest prison sentence is 16 years.
A small plane flying by men was forced to make an exhaust landing on Sao Joao da Caparica beach yesterday due to a technical fault.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the incident, some of whom ran away from the landing machine.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit the man who was on the back of the plane.
Immediately after that, the plane got up and when it landed again, it hit the child in the head, Filipe Janeira told Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not injured.
At the beach, the officers surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started beating the rear, said Celia Rocha in the Correio da Manha newspaper.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It is a miracle that no more people died.
The two men on the plane were not injured in the forced landing.
The Finnish star who tragically lost his leg won gold again: "without accident I would not be a world champion"
In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Matti Greater Hamari celebrated Finland's time in the World Cup gold banked slaloms at the Big White competition in Canada.
In the past, Greater Hamari also won the Cross World Cup gold.
In all, three world titles have now been accumulated.
Pretty incredible World Cup!
Twice the gold was treated, a pretty good heart rate was pulled, Greater Hamari was welcomed by telephone.
The 30-year-old officer thanked his coach and his very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Greater Hamari, the number of contenders in the sport is increasing all the time.
The whole of Paraluminium has grown and developed a lot recently.
The differences are decreasing and there are many new officers involved.
You always think that there will be a black horse.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Greater Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had fallen enthusiastically from the young to his friends, and the accident did not want to get to the slopes.
It comes to mind from time to time that what my life would be like without an accident.
But my attitude has always been that there is no need to dislodge.
Those cards are played, which is shared, Greater Hamari stresses.
It would be cruel to juggle a serious accident and the loss of a limb as a stroke, and neither would Greater Hamari.
But he turned the terrible difficulty to his advantage.
Yes, I would say it turned into a victory.
I would not be a triple world champion without accident.
Before the accident, Greater Hamari, aged 23, was already fading.
It was not until after the accident that the Duuni headed to the summit.
As a kid, I worked with guys, and we were always excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams, which dimmed somewhat over time.
After the accident I found myself some way from where X-Games started.
I could not have imagined beforehand.
I was 23 years old and I wonder if this is going to be a really long life if I stay here to get bitter and grief.
I decided to pull the scratches and start work.
I would say I have been quite successful.
The officers were very pleased with the selection of wheelchair player Leo-Pekka Star as athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic champion won his prize at a sports gala in January.
According to Greater Hamari, Star's victory is an important signal to the paramilitary.
It was a big deal, and it was definitely deserved.
This will certainly also open the eyes to the world of Para Sports.
Because is it time to launch a double World Champion Matti Greater Hamari Athlete of the Year campaign?
You'll see it in time.
I try to do my best to be successful.
Yet Greater Hamari has not conquered all the coveted peaks.
Next year's big goal.
After a year, Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
Yes, you start to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugee youth do not believe they will return to their country permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees investigation examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees shine bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youth do not believe they will return to their country permanently.
They say that the end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seen as bringing change to the Syrian conflict.
The communications office chain Burson-Marsteller explained the opinions and attitudes of the young Syrian refugees in international research.
BURSON-MARSTELLER has been studying the opinions and attitudes of Arab youths for nine years.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees investigation revealed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February and March 2017, a total of 400 Syrians aged 18 to 24, half of whom are women and half are men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their country permanently in the future.
42% of respondents thought they would return to their country and 4% could not say.
According to the study, the decision of young people to return home is most influenced by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most influential factor in a permanent return to the country, while a quarter think the most important thing would be to leave the country.
Only less than a tenth of the major factors contributing to the decision are the improvement in the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict
The Syrian youth was asked what the main factor is for ending the conflict.
The majority believes that the end of the war is more essential than the departure of President Bashar al-Assad.
Just over a quarter consider al-Assad's president an obstacle to a peace agreement.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the current Syrian conflict.
To resolve the conflict by means of military action alone does not count for just over a quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugee youth see Isis's power weakened over the past year, while a fifth feels its power has strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and in general against terrorism, is that the media should inform people that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many gave priority to military action and education reform.
Just over a tenth think that the most important thing would be to create better paid jobs for young people.
Asked about the impact of the Trump administration on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Almost one in four believe the Syrian conflict will worsen during Trump's term.
Opinions are divided as to whether Russia and Iran have improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding to keep the web in order - for example, Wikipedia and Google use the database he developed
The Espoo company, MariaDB, is developing the "open-source" database that is the world's fastest growing.
The main product of MariaDB, set up by Koodar entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, does not cost users anything at all and can be developed through the internet by any eminent programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
Through databases, huge amounts of information remain in order and quickly available.
If you use LinkedIn, Twitter or Booking.com, for example, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All the information, which is not in the form of a picture, comes from the database and the images have been linked to it," explains Widenius.
Widenius, who is the technology director at MariaDB, spends about half his time coding.
For his part, the man who works remotely from the beautiful hands takes care that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open-source database with MySQL, along with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later, the software giant Oracle would grab Sun's 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle trade took place, a large number of MySQL developers said they would leave.
"They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not give a definite promise about MySQL's future," Widenius recounts.
He had already set up a company at this stage to develop MariaDB.
He did not want his life work to die.
I hired 20 of the best developers from the Sun, thus ensuring continuity of the code with the help of the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open-source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
The name just had to be changed.
A foundation was created to oversee the development of the MariaDB code.
"During MySQL these assurances were not made," Widenius laments.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL's billions, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"Over the last few years, our growth rate has been about 50% a year," says Kenneth Paqvalé, president of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which is focused on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is skimpy on the company's trappings.
He reveals that in the current fiscal year, MariaDB estimates that it will receive 20 million euros in orders.
Since the database is free, the company has developed around it services that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps with the exchange of databases, which can be a task for more than a year if the customer has used a closed database.
The exchange from MySQL to MariaDB is successful overnight because they are versions of each other.
Telefónica, the Spanish operator, and DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia, are among the paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaba Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in Linux operating systems delivery packages, which have largely replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small business, we have links to the biggest gamblers.
"Our clients include some of the world's biggest telecoms operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central banks," Paqvalé added.
The database market is still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP in their closed databases.
Oraclellek MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although the research firm Gartner says that the biggest database companies have lost market share in recent years, gamblers like MariaDB are still invalid, albeit fast growing, accounts.
With about $50 billion in the database market, open-source databases do not even reach one billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in money, because most users pay nothing for these software.
Research firm Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications over open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been replaced with open databases at the time, or at least the transition would have begun.
Big companies do not get new customers, because most choose the open source code next.
This has led to a jump in licensing fees for commercial databases.
Companies want to make as much money as in the past with a smaller number of customers, "Widenius says.
Because the switching of the closed database is difficult, most of the customer companies have listened to the price increases.
"There are a lot of customers who find it really difficult to move because their old applications and others are caught in a closed database," Widenius said.
He still believes that the customer's measure is coming full.
When licence fees rise every year, the customer moves to the open-source database sooner or later.
The price is between 10% and 20% above the previous price, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if they so wish.
Moreover, many companies are facing major systemic changes as they transfer their operations to cloud computing.
At the same time, many people change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a €25 million loan from the EIB.
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has about 115 employees worldwide and is now planning to hire more.
One reason for the EIB's funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT contracts.
The company has public sector customers in Britain and Germany, for example.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros annually from databases.
"Many countries want to move to open-source solutions and thus use tax money more efficiently," Paqvalén said.
Widenius deplores how in Finland, for example, money is wasted on closed healthcare systems, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some people say that open source code is an ideology, but I think it is a better way to code.
The community helps and does something that is not invented or able to do.
The 55-year-old Widenius is one of the best known open-source promoters, Linux developer Linus Torvalds.
Widenius is helping other companies to develop functional business models on top of the open source code.
I still talk 4-5 every year around the world about this topic.
Italy intensifies its attitude towards civil society rescue vessels
Italy has warned NGOs rescuing refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue their activities unless they commit themselves to new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they could continue to operate," the interior minister, Marco Minniti, said in an interview with the Tori newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitt's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized the German Jugend Rettet aid ship. Its crew is suspected of collaborating with human smugglers to promote illegal immigration.
The aid agency, which has been operating for only a year, declined to comment on the detailed charges against Ambrogio Cartosion.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area," the organisation said in a statement posted on social media.
"We will only be able to assess the allegations when we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa Rettet organisation since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken direct refugees from human smugglers who reused the boats.
One such incident is alleged to have occurred just a couple of miles from the Libyan coast. The information appears in the prosecutor's document, which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have defied the Italian coastguard, which is monitoring rescue operations in the area. The motive is considered to be the enthusiasm for helping.
According to the code of conduct, vessels such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer to monitor the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the Code: save the Children and Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
Who announced on Thursday that he considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they do not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the organization's rescue.
Among those who refused to comply with the code of conduct are the Nobel laureate Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti, for his part, said that the number of migrants who have arrived in Italy in recent weeks has fallen sharply, which he sees as evidence that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperate with local mayors are beginning to produce results.
"In recent days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that plans to continue discussions this month with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of killing his unmarried partner Enontek, suspect found in terrain - a case for prosecutor
The alleged crime took place in Kuttase last December.
According to police, a 36-year-old man from Czech Republic is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish unmarried partner.
It has been reported in the past that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also said that the suspect had fled with two dogs after his actions.
The man was found in cold terrain and did not resist taking hold.
The charge in the case must be brought within less than a week.
The case may still be dropped in Lapland District Court in August.
Robert Hardy, who is known for Harry Potter and the series "My Almighty Friends," has died
British actor Robert Hardy has died aged 91.
The actor's death was announced Thursday by his family.
Hardy, born in 1925, started his actor career at the theatre at the age of 24.
During his long career he also played in films and television.
Hardy will be remembered in particular for the role played by Magic Minister Cornelius Toffe in the Harry Potter films and for his vets role in the "Everything My Friends" series based on James Herriot.
The popular BBC series was filmed all seven months.
Michelle Carter sentenced to prison for text messages that provoked suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for texting and phone calls deemed to have provoked the suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted of manslaughter in June. His boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said during Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter applied for a change in judgment and was expected to pursue the application in freedom.
He was threatened with a sentence of 20 years, but his lawyers say both Carter and Roy are suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a creamy blouse, listened to his sentence in the hands of a wailing gaze created on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"He decided to improve Conrad's life.
He has not taken responsibility, "the prosecutor continued.
"He has not shown remorse."
Carter's attorney said the case was due to "tragic circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that Carter's "age or maturity and even mental health problems did not have a significant impact on his actions."
The prosecutor read a statement from Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, in which the mother said, "It does not take a day for me not to mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I can cope with all this. I try my best to comfort her sister in the pain we will always carry. "
Conrad's sister Camdy Roy told the court that she "haunts" the idea that she will never see her brother's wedding or be an aunt to her children.
"It is painful to lose a person who has been in my life every day since I was born; it is a pain that never loves," Camdy said.
The case appears to set a precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that incitement to suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car with carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it emerged that Carter had instigated her boyfriend in his text messages to commit suicide.
"Hang yourself, jump from the ceiling, stab yourself. I do not know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages he had sent to Roy in the two weeks leading up to his death. Roy was on holiday with his family at the time.
Just shortly before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start a generator, and you are free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention in Roy's death. The judge ruled that Carter should not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided experts' opinions.
Only a few have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering her British colleague in Italy in 2007, who was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published a Knox opinion piece saying, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary-General: relations with Russia worst since Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated markedly, commented NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work towards close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukrainian region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO remains committed to acting to ensure that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid further escalation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump had said that relations between the US and Russia had reached even dangerously bad levels.
Trump called on Congress, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia, to praise the bad relations between the two countries.
Audi makes changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to setback suffered by car manufacturers
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to update more than 350,000 car software.
The head of BMW said he believed that "there are more reasonable options than driving restrictions." He referred to European cities, including BMW's home city of Munich, which are considering limiting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it would make changes to more than 3 million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke about the invitation.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to meet CO2 targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
Installation costs for equipment that neutralise emissions are rising, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely watched, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of being behind the big car companies and ignoring the problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed scam devices in cars that reduced emissions in line with regulations in tests. In ordinary driving, the emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of Audi's motor development department, who was responsible for the thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
ZACCHEO Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for possible trial.
Earlier this year Audi was withdrawn from the Volkswagen criminal investigation. The authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system to circumvent European emission requirements. The accusation was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The Audi investigation may significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the manufacturer's share of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionately high.
Venezuela vote started with rigging, big demonstrations there
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the actual number of voters.
This is an unheard of opinion from firms that have no role in the election result, Tibisay Lucenan, chairman of the National Electoral Commission, told reporters.
Maduro assures us that crisis will end
In a controversial vote in Venezuela on Sunday, an assembly was elected to amend the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against its change.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they can take place at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais, on Wednesday evening the national security forces began taking control of the country's parliament building.
The troops are supposed to ensure the security of the appointment ceremony.
Climate change threatens Laventel in Provence
The lavender has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender had fallen due to drought and disease insects, and scientists and farmers are frantically trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is downright endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years. They have led to a marked reduction in the rainfall in the spring and especially in the autumn," says Eric Chaisse, an agricultural expert at the CRIEPPAM Research Institute in Provence.
"This shortens the life time of lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought a lot of small piles of microbacteria to the region. "
The stakes are tough.
Lavender oil attracts tourists and is also a highly sought-after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of long stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or missing completely," Chaisse said.
"In other words, there are fewer parts containing essential oil."
The solution is sought by intensifying irrigation, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture and injecting plants with a protective mixture of clay and water. In addition, more sustainable varieties will be developed for drought.
Journalist's murder reflects growing threat in Mexico
The editorial of the Riodoce newspaper, which appears once a week, usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in Sinaloa state.
Today, however, security is being discussed because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: to leave the children at home or to bring them into the delivery where a grenade attack took place in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the front of the room's blackboard: opponents, neutral, allies.
They ask journalists for names in each group. No proof is needed, the observations and feelings are sufficient.
The names of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on the payroll of government or drug cartels are on the chart, criminals who make Mexico's chaos a life-threatening news coverage.
Violence is unrelenting, and journalists are increasingly targeted by attacks. According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 victims of attacks and threats under federal protection. At least seven journalists in seven states have been murdered in the past year.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, the founder, journalist and inspiration of Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is much needed, even though he is present everywhere. The façade of the Riodoce building is covered with a huge picture of Valdez showing the middle finger. The photo reads, "Justice." Third-person journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are wearing T-shirts adorned with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a trademark panama hat.
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez's death. Journalists discuss their common fears of trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was set up specifically for the handling of journalists' cases, but according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two charges have been brought so far.
The murderers of journalists are rarely prosecuted, as are the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, few who end up in court.
Riodoce's editors plan to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are grievous and the situation is even more dangerous.
Ibarra says the security meeting is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope for justice.
"This meeting is frankly a waste of time," he said.
"We cannot trust anyone as long as we do not know the cause of the event."
Valdez had left Riodoce in the state capital, Culiacan, on 15 May 2017.
He had driven his red Toyota just a couple of blocks away when he was stopped and forced out of his car and fired twelve shots. The number is supposedly related to the magazine's name: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some way away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left grieving by his wife and two adult children.
The rumours are moving fast and the water is running freely in Culiacan.
The death of Valdez is, however, a mouse.
Sinaloa has been Mexico's bloodiest battlefield since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January. Rival factions want to fill the void.
Some or several people are shot dead on the streets of Sinaloa every day, and the cemetery has decorative two-storey burial buildings of drug barons larger than many homes.
The coastal state is "peaceful" when only one cartel dominates ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his job, the founder and director of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez, feels guilty for failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez. He leads a rival faction that is waging war against the sons of Guzman.
The story could upset Guzman's sons: customers who suspected of being gang members bought each edition of the magazine as soon as the magazine entered the outlets.
Another error was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published the same story came under attack.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had a long career at Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up a meeting with five colleagues in Riodoce. The magazine's shares were then sold for $50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to feel bold and honest, and its sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing highly investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by the articles in the magazine that no one else dared publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for his coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Committee Award for his courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade relentlessly.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said when he received the prize from the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Drug trafficking is a "way of life" in Sinaloa, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"The journalist has to take on the task that falls on him - or play stupid.
I do not want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was sown here - why not tell me what was going on? "
The staff of Riodoce longs for Valdez - a joke who cursed like a dock worker. They miss a friend who always had a hug and advice. They need a teacher who knew how to cope.
They relied on his routine.
He always used a panama hat.
He went to an editorial bar in El Guayabo and always sat at the same table.
Now they are asking whether the routines will be his fate.
The death of a colleague has also made them think about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"Criminals do not like it if we deal with their women and children and their clean business, their secret drug-trafficking runways.
They were excluded, "Bojorquez says.
In the best case, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection,
Trust in your own instincts.
If you feel that everything is not right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to the journalist Andres Villarreal, is that "the impression can be deceiving and that is what happened in Javier's case."
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulias, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought to the room where Riodoce's security training was held. A few days earlier, it emerged that only spy programs sold to governments had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two policemen had taken refuge in a tree overshadowed by 40 degree heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce's premises, located in a four-storey building in the middle-class Culiacan district.
Some journalists thought it was half joking whether the two policemen were among the 50% who the governor of the state did not think were reliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited the mountainous countryside controlled by drug gangs.
In this week's edition, Riodoce planned three main cases.
The Boxing Chavez brother of Julio Cesar had been killed in Sinaloa.
The magazine also intended to reveal that the government's spending had focused on the governor's home town.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a quarter from the prosecutor's office, had kidnapped a group of people.
There was no official information on who was abducted and how, so we had to proceed cautiously: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out in public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). the PRI has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about previous cases in the same place. In one of them, "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they received reliable information about the kidnapping from Valdez's column.
"In the past, we would have known what had happened," says the 46-year-old Villarreal, who has had a slim body structure nicknamed "El Flaco," Ohukainen.
"Now all contact with our sources of information is off."
Valdez's office has been turned into a warehouse, maintaining signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists. The magazine's employees have had a new, unexpected task: they have become press freedom activists.
The journalist, Miriam Ramirez, took a few signs after leaving the local prosecutor's office the following morning to protest against the murder of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez's assassination.
After the disappearance, a burned body was discovered, which is based on DNA tests carried out by the authorities on Adame.
Journalists have started to protest louder across the country. In demonstrations on pavements and buildings, "SOS Press" texts appear.
Today, Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to gain international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
On the day after Valdez's assassination, Ramirez met the Sinaloa governor and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they tell the truth.
He has since asked that he be removed from the government because he is worried that he will not be able to be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexico was surrounded by organised crime, criminal authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narkojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed on the orders of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Articulo 19 monitoring group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by police and authorities.
"In Mexico people are silenced by killing," Ramirez said.
The murders have a crippling effect.
Nobody will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipasi six years ago.
His body was accompanied by a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I am here for my writing."
Next to his amputated head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to close, such as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua, following the March murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach.
Some continue to operate, like Nuevo Laredo's El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message on his front page to the drug cartels: "what do you want from us?"
Some of the journalists have fled their state or country.
It is a difficult decision.
It is hard to find a job in exile, and you have to be careful all the time.
Sometimes, criminals look for a journalist's hand, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a Mexico City apartment in 2015, three months after he fled Veraca.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra - who had to become a poet at the time - admits that writing about drugs is scared.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Not long ago, the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the editorial at midnight on the pavement with a beer, after the latest edition had been completed. Suddenly, their phones started to sign a colour message.
The shooting between rival gangs and security forces at the Mazatlan beach resort killed 19 people.
The war intensified, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Reporters put the news on Riodoce's website from the pavement on their smartphones.
The front page had to be redesigned the next day.
The siren went out nearby - yet another shooting scene.
Bojorquez looked at the policemen guarding the delivery:
If they were afraid, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's editorial continued the tradition of the magazine's murdered founder under this massive portrait of a man showing the middle finger to the whole sino.
Bojorquez says he cannot even consider stopping the operation. "How could I close the newspaper when our trainee asked to get on the street to do the same thing on the day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge setback - "hard place"
In April, the Hannu Manninen festival, which was 39 years old, fell short because the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period started with a catastrophic effect when Manninen contracted the flu.
It started with a long period of ill health, which lasted nearly five weeks.
In practice, May went completely ill.
First there was the flu and finally the kind of teething like an ear infection I had to eat with antibiotics.
I was able to do only 10% of the planned exercises.
I cannot remember when I last had some sore time.
It was a tough place not to take advantage of the traineeship, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanomat.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 world champion only received a traineeship permit in the second week of June, which was reflected in the roller carpet test carried out on 12 June by the Kilpa and Top Sports Research Centre.
During the test, the athlete skies in roller skates on the carpet, which is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes the athlete's finger with a needle for a milk acid sample.
Last autumn I spent 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I stayed for only 28 minutes.
Came on the wall, Manninen says.
For the better
After the initial difficulties, Manninen says he remained healthy.
I have been doing a variety of calm aerobic exercises to try to normalise the body's metabolism.
It is a really good five week period.
The celebration was also a week and a half away from the flight home.
I also have time to visit the cottage with my family.
Last season, Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening race, when Manninen reached the top 18 in skiing.
Guidelines withdrawn
Manninen and national team head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan that runs until next February.
We are now looking for a different kind of rhythm compared to last season.
After the first snow games, Rukka would have three World Cup games a weekend.
In December it would be at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January the plans would have to be included in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, the name will be on the Olympic team list, Manninen said.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be Manninen's sixth Winter Olympics career.
The most important thing now is to stay healthy, the Nummelian who celebrated gold in the 2002 team competition in Salt Lake City.
Dinosaur protected from its enemies by disguising
At first it looks like a scary statue.
Now scientists have revealed the first findings of a Canadian miner's discovery of a rhino size that was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that researchers could even determine that its Finnish skin was red brown and had a "problematic past."
According to Current Biology, it is the best ever panned dinosaur and the best of its kind in the world.
The fossil found recently is a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period 110-112 million years ago.
Scientists see this remarkably well preserved fossil as a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic, the armoured vegetarian is the best preserved fossil of all its kind.
It was found at the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was found by a miner called Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock and decided to study its discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum in Tyrrell.
There, for six years, the beast was dug out of the 1,100 kilogram block.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
"If you clean your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says Caleb Brown, a science writer who works as a researcher at Tyrrell's Royal Museum.
"It will go down in the history of science with the dinosaurs Mona Lisana, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
The leather studies found that dinosaurs eating the meat were probably a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had an armored and resembled a walking tank.
Its red and white pantry was disguised by its predators, and it was also protected from a darker and blond colouring that still exists in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to blend in with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million year old nodosaurus made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Paleontological Museum in Tyrrell.
According to Mark Mitchell, a museum technician from Borealope Markmitchelli, the researchers have named it. Mitchell was part of a team that took more than 7,000 hours to pick up the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly that Mitchell and the international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body's flesh and armored.
They found that it was still protected by a general colouring in the animal world, where the body is darker and blond.
The finding was a surprise, however, because Borealopa is significantly larger than the current animals with a similar colouring.
It suggests that dinosaurs who eat meat prey to such an extent that evolution favoured survival as a means of hiding instead of fighting.
The current animals, for example, have a similar colouring of deer, zebra and armadillos, which are significantly smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that the nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
"The predation of a large, heavily armoured dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period were," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in Nodosaurus reveals that its skins were red brown.
Scientists will continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, and they will study, among other things, its bowel content to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Investigators believe it fell dead in the river and into the sea, where it sank wide of the seabed.
Alberta was as hot as it is today in Florida, and the rivers and seas were likely to extend much further than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is really significant because its Finnish leather has been preserved and it has also remained three-dimensional in its original form," Brown says.
"That is why it looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period
To grasp it does not require much imagination: if you squeeze a little eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping. "
The breeding season was the era of impropofoes, huge two-legged dinosaurs eating meat.
Even though their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived for millions of years in Borealopelta before, its mighty predecessors may have caught this armoured dinosaur.
Tyrannosaurus rex's predecessors included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, a monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in the journal Current Biology. They believe that Borealopa washed into the sea after his death and mutated into the mud.
It was found at the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was found by a miner called Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armoured dinosaur with its skins and armored hills.
The Nodosaurus averaged five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
The two semi-detached spikes were raised.
The researchers believe that this armoured vegetarian went through the current western Canada until the river flooded its open sea.
Its armored remains, including small details, in an undersea grave.
Its fossilised remains have been preserved so well that its skins are still left in its bumpy armored discs along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such survival is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The more you look at it, the more astonishing it feels.
Its bumpy skull chart still has fossilised leather.
Its right front foot is on its side, five stoves up.
I will also be able to count the Finds on its football base. "
How did one activist learn to answer the question: who are the streets?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
He had arrived a day earlier in New York from his home in St. Louis and sat on his Airbnb flat bed to browse Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high school mate:
"The police killed a young 18-year-old and his body is still in the street."
He was embarrassed to note that no one else had posted the same information on his feed. That is why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous rendezvous wires from user @ TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to a rapper in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about the death of Michael Brown.
That user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body in the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for him and his community.
He put his phone away. When he returned to Twitter later that evening, people gathered in Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police officers screaming and shouting at people and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, carrying a sign saying: "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell watched a real-time video of the police standing in front of the protesters barking with the dog.
He says he has also seen a video of another policeman hurling his rifle and shouting, "I will kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers saying.
"It was not the kind of murder we are already used to and could be described as typical.
Then I felt cold colours.
I was angry and wept. "
He booked the return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed on an eleventh night. Ferrell went to search for his six-year-old daughter's father and decided they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next almost three years has been made into the documentary "Whose Streets?." It premiere in cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, and strength and perseverance from the perspective of local people who took to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with his daughter, dressed in flower dresses and a crown compatible with it, they reopened the conversation about "what it is to live in black and under what conditions." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We are going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that is not right."
"I could not take my daughter with me," Ferrell said later.
"Today's events are... the culmination of past events.
My daughter has the right to know and grow up.
He needs to be prepared for activism and organisation, but he also needs to feel the different layers and conditions of the experience of living in black. And he must know what we have to do to liberate ourselves.
Although I have fortunately been able to protect her from blatant racism, she is still similar to other black girls.
I feel that I would harm him if I protected him from reality. "
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, located opposite the police station. It became a camp for activists, waiting for information on the handling of the case and eventually knowing that the police would not be prosecuted.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," she says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was the president of the Minority Nursing Students' Organization.
"I had no experience of organising.
Somehow it just happened. "
Weeks later, in an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the documentary's deputy director.
Folayan said he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "simply wanted to tell" what was happening.
Ferrell's mind was creeping into doubt. He asked, "Do you really want to tell what is happening, or do you want a story you can use for good?"
The reason for the suspicion was the countless times when people appeared in the local community, usually white, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice," Folayan said recently in an interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism with the prisoners on death row.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project, along with six other locals. The crew followed the events in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This is not a documentary where someone talks to us or speaks for us, but we talk," Davis said.
"The most important thing for me was how local people are presented in the film, because I am presented in the same way."
Folayan said that the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience, because he wanted to show that the popular movement "is not about charismatic leader but about community." But Ferrell proved to be the most transparent.
That is why the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs, explaining what it was like to see the film for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human description of blacks require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story times and brings back to the heart the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (# BlackLivesMatter) after police fired black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement alive," Ferrell says. "It is because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black QUEER-NAISET has had to endure everything. "
Folayan agrees: "black women, among whom are a lot of queer women, do maintain the movement."
However, he points out that Ferrell was not selected for the documentary because of his queer identity.
"He got energy moving," Folayan said.
"It is no accident that he was on the front line. Black QUEER-NAIs live at the cutting edge of many things and have a lot at stake.
His energy is conveyed on the screen. "
The news photography groups left Ferguson a long time ago, but relations between the community and the police remain strained.
Ferrell still has two and a half years' parole, and he was sentenced for blocking the motorway at the demonstration.
His description of the social political climate in his home is short and concise: "a mess."
Yet he continues to rely on the slogan he learned from outside the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our shackles. "
Suitable consistency: the artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York has hung in the middle of the exhibition room with faces - white, black and brown, between which one can see more closely the similarities.
These 30 works are portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where he served his sentence of 35 years. Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
The Dewey-Hagborg A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on 2 August 2017.
It is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transwoman and a pioneering dissident whose prison sentence Barack Obama eased on the third day of his term in office.
Dewey-Hagborg analysed Manning's DNA in an algorithm and created 30 portraits based on his genetic information. They are a sharp, though somewhat theoretical, statement on the editing of DNA data, ambiguity and the causal relationships underlying interpretations and identity.
Chelsea Manning, under her birth name Bradley Edward, has openly said that she identified with women from puberty. He was found guilty in 2013 of 20 offences, including spying law violations, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning sentenced to prison: a hail, black and white selfie in which the bother Manning sits in the car in the driver's seat. He has a platinum pink wig on his head which became his hallmark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was backed by the Stranger Visions project, which he implemented in 2012.
He created the portraits on the basis of forensic data, and he obtained DNA data on, for example, cigarette butts and gum and created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
The artist then received an email from Paper magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of his story," Dewey-Hagborg told the new exhibition briefing.
Manning was unable to visit him and could not be described in prison, so the newspaper contacted Chelsea and asked if he would be interested in making Manning a DNA portrait.
The artist and his captive mother suddenly became correspondents and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even collaborated on the Suppressed Images comic book, which was illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, describing a future in which the president would relax Chelsea's judgment and he would be able to watch the exhibition.
In reality, Obama reduced Manning's sentence to just a few days after the publication of the comic book. It was a fortunate coincidence after seven tough years spent in a national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened at a time when Donald Trump is waging his own war against leaks and transgender soldiers and is finding new ways on Twitter to strengthen the strong divisions he was supposed to have.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has its purpose."
There is an artist's statement on the wall of the gallery, and Manning's big name writing under it, where the surname is heart. In his statement, the artist calls for an end to "the automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based."
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA section: a long queue of letters C, G and A written on pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters - or nucleotides, as is the scientific definition used by the artist - Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are all, at least in terms of biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people to understand that we are equal to our genetic heritage and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretation," Dewey-Hagborg said. The exhibition also features his Spurious Memories video work from 2007.
"DNA tells countless stories. Here are 30 of them."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: the page from the comic book of Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
That is where Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, in his hand a megaphone.
"If they get you silenced, they've won," it says.
"Never be silent."
"The text is a letter I received from Manning," the artist from Philadelphia says.
"It is so impressive that I still get cold colours."
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he will be greeted by his own genetic information as a group of demonstrators in the middle of the exhibition room.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA period is written on a pencil to a height equal to his length (157.5 cm).
"The faces were on the wall in the past, but I wanted to bring a bunch of people into them," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to describe the mass movement generated by Chelsea, which was also behind his release."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee are being sought on suspicion of murder
Police say they have launched a nationwide search to find a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a luxury Chicago apartment.
Court documents show that warrants were issued on Monday for Wyndham Lathemi, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau. Warrants have been issued for first-degree murder without the possibility of being released on bail.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local press release issued by Chicago Police, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
Alerted police in the Grand Plaza apartment building found the victim, who had multiple slit wounds in his body.
According to authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and is being investigated for murder. The police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwester University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, deputy lecturer in social relations at the university, said in an email that Lathem is now administrative free and has been denied access to the campuses of Northwestern University.
"This is a criminal matter that the authorities are investigating and Northwestern University is helping in the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
In an e-mail sent by a university and Somerville College spokesman, it says, "We have been in contact with the police in Great Britain and are ready to assist the authorities investigating the case in the United States in all possible ways."
In addition, the statement said that Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope he will surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, information officer for the Chicago Police Department, said he was calling on the suspects to seriously surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and we are constantly checking our searches," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are helping in the search for suspects.
He told the police he received a call from the host of the Grand Plaza building, which had received a vague hint that something had happened in the apartment at 1008.
The police described the scene as horrific.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team issued the following statement to residents: "the police are currently investigating the course of events and the victim's background and possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
Man threatened to blow up Islamic bookshop and 'kill Muslims' in London
"I am not anti-Muslim, I am Catholic," the condemned told the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of his threats to blow up an Islamic bookshop in London and "kill all Muslims."
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of gross harassment, among other things.
According to police, the bookshop staff alerted them on May 23.
According to the staff, the man had "threatened to blow up the bookshop and kill Muslims."
The suspect left the shop after threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police about intimidation.
The intimidation was not related to the bookshop.
The authorities found that Moffatt was wearing the same dress as the suspect in the bookshop, a police spokesman said.
I am not anti-Muslim, I am Catholic, Moffatt told police during interrogations.
As punishment, a man must carry out 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay legal costs of around £620, or £690, and compensation of around £85, or 95 euros, to the victims.
According to a Scotland Yard spokesman, several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will close the WADA road map in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the World Anti-Doping Agency's WADA road map to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission, Rusada.
"Some of the measures under the roadmap have already been implemented and RUSADA was given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD.
The WADA road map has been updated in this respect, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map setting out the conditions for restoring Rusada's powers. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing worrying for Russia.
"Everything is announced, and everything is done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future, "Mutko added.
However, one of the points of the roadmap requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities publicly accept the findings of the investigation by Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer, ordered by WADA. McLaren is investigating the alleged role of the state in doping in Russian sport.
Mutko said: "the investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All the measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes and we cannot admit something that did not exist. "
Mr Mutko's words echoed the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of the independent National Anti-Doping Commission.
Earlier the same day, Smirnov, speaking to Russian sports media at RSport, admitted that there were problems with the Russian anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial statements and regulations.
We will not accept the report unconditionally, "he added.
Wada ordered Rusada to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015 after the extent of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it was given permission to design and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, Olive Niggli, Wada's director, visited Rusada's headquarters in Moscow. After the visit, he said that the organisation was "on the right track" towards restoring powers.
British organisation sceptical about innovation dear to Finns: 'there is no evidence' of health benefits of maternity packages
The British organisation suspects the benefits of Finnish style maternity packages.
For example, the BBC and the Guardian report that the Lullaby Trust, which fights cot deaths, prohibits the use of its own brochures in maternity packages distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, too, the packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that maternity packaging reduces the risk of cot death.
Cot death means the unexplained sudden death of a baby.
The Lullaby Trust is an expert on the safe sleep of the child in the UK health authorities.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed into them because it would suggest that we are recommending this product, the organization informed us.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, only two deaths per thousand births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland's good figure is the result of a variety of reasons, including the low number of teenage pregnancies.
Giving each family a box there may be one factor.
But you cannot say that for sure, Francine Bates, CEO of the Lullaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity packages are being marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and cot death.
Maternity packaging is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers in Finland for free for 80 years.
The packaging contains different supplies, such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products on the packaging.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it has distributed meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust, for its part, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a sleeping place.
According to Lullaby Trust, packing can be the best option for sleeping if there is no body or surface bed available.
The organization recommends that you only use the packaging for daytime sleep and stop using it when the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the pack and ensuring that they do not grow or get dirty.
The villain got out of the Japanese zoo for a second time
The staff of the Japanese zoo are looking for a runaway turtle.
The giant tortoise has surprised his staff with speed and has escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The tortoise escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama in western Japan on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, said.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is narrow-minded, 55-kilogram and about a metre long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
In opening hours, the villain can travel freely in the area of the garden.
The zoo has not received eyewitnesses from the turtle.
The previous roundabout of the villain occurred the week before.
Yamane found the fugitive walking along the road 150 metres from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your company avoid Uber's mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in her online shopping startup, but the polls did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he confirmed that the queries were anonymous, some of the workers were suspicious of them.
"The polls were simply neither consistent nor objective," Errett says. Madison Reed, her hair care company, focuses on online shopping. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside assistance.
The market has become increasingly transformed into startup companies for human resources management, helping other companies to find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement. Companies can submit queries and target them to certain teams and groups of the population and provide anonymous reporting services to their employees and in some cases direct contact with the senior management over the government.
"You can follow your own health with applications like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the business Fitbit?" Asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of the Glint Startup in Redwood City. Glint provides companies with analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years. He says that he has a more profound view of his employees' thoughts and feelings.
The program can make quick enquiries and votes for certain teams. In addition, it can draw up a map showing at one glance which departments are the most dissatisfied and which managers have received the weakest estimates. These have enabled Errett to get to the root of the problems.
Companies have realised that they need to follow the workplace culture so that they do not become the next Uber. Since the former employee wrote on his blog about a culture in which employees are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished, the transport company has been surrounded by turmoil.
For startups like Glint, such failures are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and conformity are a global industry worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, based in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate use. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation suffered a blow.
Convercenter has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently signed an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent enables companies to carry out customised questionnaires, collect responses confidently in real time and identify problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by text message.
And if the director is suspected of impropriety, the complaints go directly to the company's board.
"Public opinion has superseded the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercenter.
He recalls that if a company treats its employees badly or works unethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company and it can also lose employees and be sued.
The Ruby Tube restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees in 500 outlets. The company has been using Convercenter for more than a year because it wants to make sure employees are aware of policies and practices and can easily connect with headquarters.
In the past, the practice was that if the employee wanted to report the problem, he first had to find out his phone number or email address, which was able to make the notification to the headquarters. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope it will be taken seriously.
"It was often a scary and unpleasant experience," says Ruby Tuesday's legal director, James Vitrano. He said it was difficult to follow up on complaints from employees.
In the past, the problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state. Now, problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive view of the reality of the worker," says Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from litigation related to working relationships."
According to Quinlan, companies started to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical conduct in the Enron scandal.
It was only through social media that the companies realised that they could no longer prevent public settlement of their dirt beans.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under ethics control," Quinlan said.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for use.
It is a business model and an opportunity accepted by private equity investors. Both Glint and Convercents are backed by private equity.
In February, Convercent collected $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital. It has amassed a total of $47 million in capital.
In November, Glint received €10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has collected a total of $60 million in funding.
Investments are no surprise, given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their jobs.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good wages and interesting projects are just the beginning.
The employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they give their time to a truly useful company.
"Employees are more committed to the company's success if they are comfortable with the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding," says LinkedIn's director of employee reward and welfare.
Investors get returns when companies are successful. Companies thrive when employees commit.
Third party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is no wonder they interest investors.
According to workplace culture experts, information about employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if no action is taken.
If a company asks its employees for feedback, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if the change does not come quickly enough or nothing changes, the disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand conversations," says Russell Raath, chief executive of the business consultancy Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on data collection.
"If the company does not take any action, the employees will start to wonder if they will hear
And does their opinions make any difference.
If the company does not care about them, why should they care about the company? "
According to Errett, Madison Reed currently conducts personnel enquiries monthly and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as it is reported in Glint.
When Errett had gathered feedback on the slow pace of decision making and the quality of communication from frustrated workers, he was able to make changes to teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuestube understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve the long-term sustainability of its staff in an industry known for its high turnover of employees.
"If a company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it loses employees," Vitrano said.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers there are no companies. "
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of secreting his naked female neighbour, TT news agency reports.
The woman, who lives in Gothenburg, had been out of the shower at home when she noticed a mobile phone hanging outside her window.
According to the woman, the camera on the mobile phone described the apartment.
The woman shocked by the incident had run into another room to dress up.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the mobile phone had been pulled up first, but then the window was reopened.
A 20-year-old man suspected of conspiracy has admitted to describing the woman.
However, he claimed he had only described the woman's face.
The video on the mobile phone had been deleted and the police had failed to return it as evidence.
During the interrogations, the man has admitted to the offence, but denied that he committed the offence.
The man who described him had argued that he loves his neighbour "just crazy."
According to the TT news agency, the man is charged in the case.
Teachers call for more muscle in autumn talks
Wage growth cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the gap should be narrowed, said OAJ President Olli Lukkainen on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday spending underlines the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements that in some way do not involve holiday shopping.
In the municipal sector, agreements will only be reached once private sector papers have been signed and the rates of increase are clear.
Lukkainen predicts that OAJ's working conditions, for example, will be agreed in January.
The percentages were not yet revealed by Luke.
Luuukkainen is also the chairman of the Jukon Association of Public Schools.
Luke: holiday haircut increases earnings differences
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is deteriorating, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Lukkainen, fixed-term holiday spending cuts will further sharpen the differences in earnings trends.
In Finland, the number of pupils per teacher must be determined.
The OAJ also points out that the equality of basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the weakest are growing all the time.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are deteriorating, and differences between pupils and regions are increasing.
Bruins players' day was my day when the NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one
It is soon eleven o'clock in the evening. A group of UCLA American football players have been left chatting to the other side of the campus's new training ground.
Some have stripped off their shirts. Their backs shine from the skiing after the first day of the training camp.
For quite a few of them, this few minutes chat is a midday break.
After three hours of practice, players studying at university summer courses will return to their hostels to read the final tests. Next morning, they will gather at half past seven Wasserman football centres.
"The next three days will be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday's change Tuesday.
The umbrella organisation for university sports reduced the number of daily exercise sessions from two to one. The change was aimed at reducing the workload of players, but it has extended their days - at least until Friday, when the final tests will be held.
That is why the first three exercises at UCLA started over seven in the quarter. It was difficult to find space for the players' already full schedules.
Limiting traineeships to one day means more training days. The camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in the Westwood coaching season of Mora's six seasons, when the exercises are held at the same time as summer courses.
The exercises are expected to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the opening match of the season begins: UCLA will face Texas A & M University in September.
Mora says he supported the NCAA rule change, even though it made the scheduling of players even stricter.
"We load them up a lot for three or four days and that is very challenging," Mora said.
"But the players are ready to work. They are great guys.
I think things will get easier when we get to Saturday. Then we will have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises after the camp. It is not easy, given the direct view from the training ground to the adjacent parking area and the Lusk Center, a high-altitude hotel that has already been bombarded by football hoverboards.
Bruins players are expected to move to the hotel this coming weekend, but Mora acknowledges that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are available outside.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The worry is that people can book a room and film exercises on the video. It is not an exaggerated concern.
The video describing the exercises is paid quite a lot.
But we have guards there and in the parking area.
We do our best.
I am not going to bother my head too much.
We have a plan. "
Freedom in Rwanda
In central Africa, Rwanda holds a presidential election on Friday, the winner of which is already considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially seeking his third term, but in practice he has contributed to running the country since 1994.
Then the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organised by the extremists.
Kagame was commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticized, among other things, for crushing the opposition and restricting the word freedom.
He has also been accused of misrepresentation of poverty statistics, for example.
For a third term, Kagame will be able to make an effort because the Constitution, which limited the presidential term to two terms, was amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely regarded leader.
During his time in Rwanda, there have been social reforms and international investment.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting the country divided by genocide.
Rwanda's success has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
Kagamekin, however, has promised his people more freedom after the country is put on its feet.
Now could be a good time to start.
Facebook fights bogus news by stepping up its audit of facts
Facebook plans to send potential fake news to more and more independent Facts Inspectors and to present the results under the original article. The world's largest social network announced this on Thursday.
On its website, the company issued a statement saying that it will start using updated computer learning to identify fake news. Any fake news will be sent to the factual inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the biggest distributors of fake news, and many believe that the fake news contributed to the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The topic has entered political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news ahead of the May presidential election and Germany, preparing for the September elections, supports a plan to fine social media networks if they do not remove hostile content quickly.
In a separate statement published in Germany on Thursday, Facebook stated that the checks of the facts are being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories do not pass through the wall of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more enlightened what to read and share," Sara Su, the Facebook News Fed product manager, wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test articles related to the subject and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The genesis of a comic book: the story of a castle
The small Scotney Castle in Kent County is now known as the Squeeze Music Video, and as Margaret Thatcher's hiding place from the 1970s and 1980s.
But it has 700 years of turbulent history. Now this charming site in the Bewl River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, the author of the old documents.
"I think it is great to get to look at the text written by a person who died more than 300 years ago," Rhodes says in a cathartic manner.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand."
Rhodes's book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era. Each story is described by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes's first book based on archives. In 2014 he appeared on Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, the source of which was the British National Library documents. The project was emotional.
"I was moved to tears when I noticed a thumb trail in the letter. The letter was written by a double agent working for the Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
"That was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell of smoke, because at that time the lighting was used as fire.
Three centuries later, the scent makes the reader feel that he is on the ground.
I love the archives! "
The writer, fascinated by the old documents, was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust and the National Arts Council of England, which seemed too good to be true. He admits that he was not afraid to be in the castle for a little longer than he would have hoped.
He spent days researching the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rarity, such as hyenas hanging on walls and bottles of the moat for centuries.
He circled the ruins of the old castle and ditched it and talked with forest guards, gardeners and sometimes artists who describe the book.
In the evenings he "took the whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's closer history is rather unknown, since the castle was moved completely to the National Trust after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the foundation staff was only just starting to get through the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held for hundreds of years by the same method: taking all the extra in the attic.
There were diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that the ground disputes are boring," Rhodes said. "Here, however, families are fighting for up to one shot.
It occurred to me that I would not be allowed to be. "
Some of the book's stories go from the castle to English history, like The Labourer. It tells of a man who, shortly after the castle was completed, is associated with the peasant rebellion in England in 1381.
"The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mention that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The peasants rebellion in England started in the same area, and it occurred to me that the rebellion could begin with riots.
Maybe these events are connected? "
Other stories in the book are closely related to the castle's history - like The Priest, the story of a priest who was hiding from the Darrell family for seven years during the Reformation of England.
The smuggler tells the story of the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century. He is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrellit are Rhodes' favourite family in Scotney. "The men of the family seem to have been quite a few sculptors. They were constantly in debt and bought things they could not afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying the wealthy old women. I see them as handsome guys who were able to courte the heir. "
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Living Hill, a sanatorium in the early 20th century, of which there is only a removable land left.
Scotney Castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to go out there," she says.
"I would not have wanted to go back to this evil daily."
Relations with Russia worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated markedly, commented NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work towards close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukrainian region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO remains committed to acting to ensure that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid further escalation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump had said that relations between the US and Russia had reached even dangerously bad levels.
Trump called on Congress, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia, to praise the bad relations between the two countries.
Vladimir Klitshko quit - the latest match against Anthony Joshua will not happen
Vladimir Klitshko, the long-time world heavyweight champion of professional boxing, is ending his career.
Klitshko, a Ukrainian, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who hit gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, played as a professional 69 times, winning 64 matches.
He held various World Cup titles between 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost the last two matches of his career.
He was knocked out by Tyson Fury in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost in the knockout on the 11th after a wild match.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet in the latest match in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko did not find motivation for the match.
I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to distance myself sufficiently from the Wembleyn match, Klitshko said in his release.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sport.
I could never have imagined having such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
Watch Klitshko's arguments for his decision on the video.
Bernd Bönte, manager of Klitshko, said in a press release that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitshko.
But he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he does not have enough motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, "Bönte said.
Since 2009, Klitshko has been socialising with the American actor Hayden Panettiere.
The couple have one child, daughter Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitshko's big brother Vitali is also a former world heavyweight champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated the World Cup titles of various federations simultaneously.
Finnish weather killer nods to conditions: "take away from the fil"
Minna Nikkanen, the vault manager, has been suffering from conditions during the summer's external season.
Minna Nikkas has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and cold have taken the woman from the cold.
The World Cup in London also has unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
The conditions have been this smooth against Minna Nikka.
I would not like to blame the track, but it was inconceivable that I could not even get the small bits to move properly, Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck Games.
I have competed and practiced here for the umpteenth time and I have never experienced the same mixed wind in this place, Nikkanen told the Paavo Nurmin Games.
During this period, it has been very difficult to keep up the jump, even when there have been such unstable winds in the exercises, Nikkanen said of Kalevan.
The weather spoke in London on Thursday.
The time has been challenging to get the technique together - whether it is cold stuck or what.
It has been cold and windy, and it has taken away from the fire.
It does not make sense to consume energy in poor conditions.
He reached the World Cup thanks to his jump 455.
It is 445.
The relationship is not the same in London.
You have to be calm and wait for better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 in Friday's shortlist.
Why do you not work abroad?
It is not necessary.
Last summer I was back in Italy and Germany.
I got the jump together and the technology standard.
Probably should have done the same now.
Normally you have got to the hall to train, now the hall has been shut.
What would be wonderful games?
25 degrees hot.
A small wind will also happen, as long as it is standard.
The experienced ex-civil servant blunted politicians at Yle: "we have no lever now or for many years"
In spite of the positive economic climate, the government of Juha Sipila must keep the ice in the hat and guard against inflating the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who prepared budgets for decades.
He says there is no division.
Yle was interviewed in 2015 about the retirement of Virta in Wednesday's One Sami.
Construction of the state's budget next year is just beginning.
Recent policy proposals, such as raising the guarantee pension, calculating car tax and supporting electric bikes, are being discussed by Mr Virtanen.
They basically tell you that the elections are coming close because when 10% of the state budget is financed with additional debt, we have no lever now or for many years.
I think it is even a fraud to talk about a paycheck when you are owed, "Virtanen told Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debt is owed by children.
Virtas has a long history of preparing state budgets: in 1978, he started at the Treasury as budget secretary and then worked as deputy head of the budget department and budget manager.
Most recently, before retiring, he was the chief of staff of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
Virtanen pointed out in an interview with Yle that the growth rate of 3% now projected is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is a surge, starting as early as next year, and Finland is expecting a 1% increase for decades.
Washington changes rules on permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules for a permanent residence permit, Green Card, would be changed with a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
Republicans have proposed new rules, and the President supports them.
The draft law is to be debated in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way in which permanent residency is granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current program.
The new application process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy, "Trump said, according to media reports.
The wife of the Queen of Denmark does not want to be buried in the same place with the Queen
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
The photo depicted Prince Henry and Queen Margaret in April.
Queen Margareeta of Denmark, 77, and Prince Henry's spouse, 83, will not be buried side by side, the court in Denmark says.
Traditionally ruler couples in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The royal house has announced today that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in its release on Thursday.
According to BT, the reason for this is the Prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been unhappy with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, the court's communications chief Lene Belleby commented in the newspaper.
The decision by the prince not to be buried alongside the Queen is a natural consequence of her not being treated as an equal with her husband.
According to the court, the Queen has long been aware of her husband's desire for burial and understands the decision.
Horror moment on the road: the car was to come on the motorway
Tomm had unmarried partners and two small children on board.
They did not get injured in the accident, but do not get insurance money if the other party is not pursued.
The crash happened at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Archive image of the Circle III building site.
Tommi, a Vantaan, says his family survived a miracle car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his unmarried partner Riina and the couple's two small children drove on a motorway to Keimolanport in the direction of Vantaalla Hämeenlinna.
The circle III joining the Hämeenlinna route drove the acceleration lane along the white car that was driving the family car to the bath, Tommi says.
Without the crew movement, the car would have come on top.
I slowed down and turned the car on at the same time, and it went out of control, Tommi says.
The family's car collided at high speed.
The parents and two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is just under 3 years old, the other less than one year old.
It was obviously pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No one drove around, even though there was a lot of traffic.
The accident happened at about 5.20 p.m.
Tommin said no one stopped to join them, and the family called the emergency services.
They got out of the car on their own.
The ambulance and rescue staff arrived and the family was checked.
The car went to redemption.
Tommi says he and his unmarried partner had a small income, and they received a grant from the family to buy the car a few years ago.
Without the information of another car, Tommin says, the family does not get the money.
That is why the family is hoping for witnesses to find out about the car that drove the family to the barriers.
We need a car every day.
It is difficult to take children to the garden and work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thought the start of the car registration number was SIG.
If the culprit is not caught, I do not know how to do it financially, we will even have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that those who have seen or know about it are in contact with the police.
The East New Police and the Central New Rescue Agency confirm that they had a job at the scene on Tuesday evening.
The title and the case were corrected at 9.15: contrary to what was originally reported in the case, Tommin said the other car did not come into the oncoming lane, but was driven from the accelerator to the family's car.
The performance, directed by Lotta Jappinen, deals with relationships through humour - a self-publicist is seen in the Which? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, brings her eldest guidance to the Mage? Theatre.
A self-publicist is a musical theatre about past relationships and inadequacy.
According to director Lotta Jappinen, it still leaves a good mind.
The subject is treated with humour.
The bad feelings do not stay in the water, he says.
The rotating summer theatre has, according to Jappa, been carried out with a quick budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the motion sues to reflect on what the person reveals about himself when he comes to a new person.
Will he perhaps take on a role or will he open another jacket?
Intriguing motion mixes facts and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatised the motion.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The draft consists of the working group's texts and is not a plot.
The director believes that, even if the performance draws on the thoughts of young people, it speaks to all ages.
Jäppinen stresses that the personal whistleblower does not directly inform his own and the group's relationships.
Facts and fiction are mixed.
My own value will certainly be conveyed from the presentation.
I do not think that relationships are bad, but nor that relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from their divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the self-publicist paints a timely picture of young adults living in Finland at 100 years old.
He says many have learned a lot about relationships with their parents, many of whom have resigned.
At least that you have to listen to yourself.
You do not have to stay in a bad relationship.
The motion is played by Minea Lång, Niklas Rauté and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes the costume maker Ella Snellman.
The music is matching Jappinen and Roka.
Love for the theatre broke out in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying for a director of theatrical expression at the Turku College of Arts.
There are two years behind you and another mokoma ahead.
The enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the Kouvolan years.
The music classes have grown up as an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre, and have played at the student theatre in Helsinki, and most recently at the Linnateatre in Turku.
Directing has become increasingly interested.
The self-publicist had his first appearance last week at the Narri stage in Helsinki.
A performance lasting about 45 minutes has also been seen in the future, at least in the Jappa study town of Turku.
A self-publicist at the Kouvola Theatre on 4 August at 19 and 5.8 at 14 and 19: 00.
The Finnish Olympic champion has been recovering from a gruesome motocross accident for a year - the neck tip came down
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable natural power as Janne Lahtela.
The mumble landing ace evaded the world for hundreds of days a year for twenty years, chasing his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtela's movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainee, but also an experimenter of new species.
There will not be many forms of exercise on earth that the chemical lady would not have tried at least once.
It is inspired to train.
There is always something new, Lahtela says.
In the end, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014 Lahtela had a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck wire and both hands were broken.
I was not working anywhere.
I slept with wounds in my home for a year, Lahtela says.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that the age could have played a part in the crash.
Driving on a prick can sound furious.
But I did not seek boundaries.
It is just so tough as a species that it is not worth too much to exercise like this four-year-old!
After the accident Lahtela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
There was a long time left behind as head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela started the stint immediately after his own career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15 years old, I had to be there.
I did not really do much, Lahtela says.
During his training, Lahtela often challenged his protégé on the slopes and in physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so tired physically and mentally that my own thoughts did not seem reasonable.
Not even among the species.
Did well to be in place.
I really enjoyed it because I just got to be.
The enforced break spurred Lahtela to become Finland's head coach.
Without stopping, he fears he would have burnt out.
It is easier to find places that have gone off than unscathed.
Without the accident I would not have realised that I needed to rest so much.
Lahtela started as coach of the Finnish freestyleman team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby in place of the pace operators.
I changed motocrosses to frisbeegolfi!
It just left the lab right away.
At worst I was throwing seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-enthusiastic trainer himself, he does not claim that he is trained to be the same as him.
I do not force everyone into the same mould.
There is room in our culture of species to be different and to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been consistent, Lahtela says.
Sex robots come and we need to worry
It is here: a report on the development of technology in the sex robot industry - just as it was starting to feel that 2017 could no longer be a strange year.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big thing now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within the next 5-10 years.
"We need to start taking the generalisation of sex robots seriously," says Noel Sharkey, a founding member of the Foundation and professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the colour of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipple and the type of prints.
"The sex robots are being hitched, but they are already sold quite a lot, and we will see more of them," Sharkey said in a news conference.
Sex dolls have evolved from breathtaking dolls to robots with warm silicone skin and features created by artificial intelligence that resemble human use.
The user can also adapt the robot to their own preferences, ranging from eye colour to nipple shape and type and colour.
It is all the more worrying that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford's women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the character features of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, say shy.
The Roxxxy Gold robots of True Companion have pre-programmed personalities: frigid Farrah seems shy, wild Wendy is so adventurous and so on.
"Roxxxxy Goldin's personality adapts as fully as possible to the personality of the user," the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, in the wind or in the wind.
There are many worrying features in the generalisation of sex robots. They replace genuine relationships, but it is even more dangerous to subjugate women and outright rape fantasies when the user approaches, for example, a shy and resistant programmed robot.
True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot to Vibrator on its website:
"Women have a vibrator. Why should men not have a sex robot?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetist or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalisation and development reflects something darker and deeper in our culture: a downturn in gender equality towards sexual relations, where subordination is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not acquire a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report indicates their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell us a lot about the spirit of time.
And many will start behaving strangely or offensively only when the market gives permission.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have started to become more common at a time when women's rights are under threat in many parts of the world and a president in the White House who has boasted of harassing women.
In the television series The Handmaid's Tale (Orjattaresi) is not the most worrying of its powerful image language, such as images of hanged bodies and excavated eyes. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
There is an attempt to make sex robots as much as it is technically possible to do with real women such as porn stars.
Robots developers want their skin to feel genuine and movements to emulate human movements as much as possible.
But their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot cannot leave the relationship or the situation.
They have neither their own will nor history - nothing to suggest independence or to break the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slave.
Police suspect: two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, led by ISIS chief
The head of the extremist organisation ISIS led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take the bomb to Etihad Airways.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a leading figure in ISIS had also sent bomb building parts to Sydney.
There were suspicions that the bomb was to be taken to a plane on 15 July, but the attempt was interrupted before the security check.
The police would not specify why the company was interrupted.
Another of the suspected terrorists' plans was to build a toxic fuel-efficient accelerator and take the device to a crowded public place, for example a public transport facility.
Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans Australia has ever made.
Because of suspected terrorist plans, four men were captured in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continuing.
Trump's virtues?
Makes Mitt Romney look like the epitome of common sense
In the Trump era, it has already been said ad nauseam that the strong divide among voters has broken down families, too.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the American newspapers' advice columns showed how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want to burst our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to reunite families.
I tell you about this because my cousin visited me this week in New York. He is a leftist poet living in Chicago who has long been at loggerheads with the Republicans.
He recalled that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousin all acquaintances - including the Republican siblings with whom he has been arguing politics for decades - are suddenly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but more broadly, there are significant risks.
Trump has given new impetus to the left, but the perverse effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalisation," we talk about the terrifying possibility that one day we will no longer be able to scare his tricks.
In the long term, there is an even more gruesome prospect that Trump will normalise the fringe of Republicans who, compared to Trump, suddenly seem quite sensible.
I look back on Mitt Romney's subdued version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (and his tax returns we have seen). compared to Trump, they seem to have very slight infringements.
Once Trump's term is over, the next Republican presidential nominee needs to be lucid, and that immediately seems like a major improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the Central Park carousel. It is the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best thing in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
The horses in the carousel are huge, the characters in the middle - the grotesque clown and the horrors they look at behind them - are ominous, and the music behind them is oddly fascinating.
Over time, many of New York's constituencies become disillusioned: prospects for tall buildings start to get tired, the city's silhouette becomes too familiar and the reality of the city does not live up to dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I have not got over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large roundabout in north London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss menu, but it is not counted.
The Central Park carousel, on the other hand, is still a strange magic experience - to the extent that two two-year-olds, one monotonous and two fourteen women enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the carousel full points if someone had asked for my assessment, but luckily no one came and asked.
Instead, I was asked this week at the supermarket to assess my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before putting my credit card on a reading device.
The same thing in the cafe at my home, but it also gives me the opportunity to combine the estimate of 15% of the service money when I go to the coffee counter.
This slows down the daily interaction and puts pressure on the customer servant to put his personality in a game where it is not needed.
The seller of the supermarket smiled with regret, when I tirelessly gave my credit card five stars for use.
Shefki Kuqi fired from Inter - "There was no leadership confidence"
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuq as the coach of the club's representative team.
Fabrizio PicCareta, who previously served as assistant coach, takes over the training responsibilities.
The rest of the training team will continue in their current duties.
PicCareta, an Italian, has worked as an assistant coach in the past, including in Sunderland, England.
The 51-year-old PicCareta, who joined Inter's training team in January, has carried out a UEFA Pro licence last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the Board of FC Inter, regrets what has happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the confidence of the club's management, where there was no other option now, Håkans commented on the club's release.
PicCareta's contract is valid until the end of the season.
Together with the rest of the training team, he is already responsible for tomorrow's home match against HIFK.
According to Evening News, the team has been turmoil throughout Thursday.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the club's assistant coaches Piccare and John Allen have been sidelined.
Kuqi and Piccareta took a strong lead in Inter's match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youthful picture from the 1980s - would you recognise a serious violin student?
Linda Lampenius, a violin fireplace, posted a youthful photo on Instagram.
Several hunters have been added to the picture, which suggests the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius college student.
Lampenius himself wonders about a serious young woman on camera.
Long ago, serious, he signals.
If the picture does not appear, you can see it here.
Lampenius has in the past published pictures of his past and also talked about painful subjects.
Just over a year ago, she posted a photo of herself on Instagram.
In another photo, she is seen 20 years ago, in another she is poseeria now, the mother of two children.
In his picture text, Lampenius considers his own growth as a human being and refers to the eating disorders he suffered as a young person.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look very much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learned how to keep myself and how I look, "Lampenius wrote.
After the text, she had added a hashtag life in English, eating disorders, insecure confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, ageing is clean.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eats of previous years.
He was already in hospital at the age of 14 because of anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also contracted bulimia, which was eventually revealed only in 2006.
The improvement started slowly.
In addition to therapy and comparisons, Lampenius helped create a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was sent from prison to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time that Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital treatment on his wrists, which he said he received after breaking down in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed against the original manslaughter conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by firing several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought of his girlfriend as a night-time intruder hiding in the WC.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again because they consider Pistorius's six-year sentence too lenient.
The Prosecutor General intends to appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal will possibly be dealt with as early as this year.
If the appeal is accepted, Pistorius' sentence could be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not used in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Campaign in Greece
Two Bulgarians illegally camped in Greece were arrested, according to the country's Foreign Ministry, according to BTV.
The police arrested a group of unlicensed people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1. Two Bulgarians were among the camps.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to TV station BTV, the Foreign Ministry later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules for free campsites and already impose substantial fines on anyone who is camped outside the designated areas.
The inspections will continue until the end of the season.
The ministry indicated that the court could impose a fine.
Liquid stock sinks - sinking already -7.7%
Oil refiner Neste's stock has plunged 7.7 percent around 11 a.m.
Its profit before tax fell, but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financials.
The stock market has started off on a mildly cold side today, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the stock markets opened, the broad European Stoxx 600 index was up 0.2 percent.
The general index of the Helsinki stock exchange, OMXH, was down 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points after about half an hour, and OMXH25, the most traded companies, was down 0.3 per cent.
The total exchange on the stock exchange was EUR 41 million, of which nine million was the morning profit publicist Neste.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like the nightmares of the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may facilitate irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in Britain. It causes stomach cramps, swelling, frequent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Those suffering from irritable bowel syndrome are generally urged to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at the University of Washington found that a protein containing the necessary amino acid tryptofaan helps the body to develop immune cells that strengthen the resilience of the bowel.
According to the study's director, Marco Colonna, immune cells guard the marsh and ensure that harmful microbes that are hidden in food do not enter the body.
Cells that cause inflammation balance cells that strengthen resilience. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the infection, the result may be irritable bowel syndrome.
The experiments found that immune cells that strengthen resilience are found in mice with a particular bacterium in the colon.
This bacterium needs tryptofaan to start appearing in immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
"We found a link between the development of Lactobacillus reuteri and resilience cells. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of normal intestinal microbiome," Professor Colonna says.
"The more tryptofaans in the mice diet, the more immune cells they had."
If the same thing works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptofan can strengthen the resilience of the intestinal tract and reduce inflammation sensitivity.
In studying immune cells that strengthen resilience, researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they were not kept apart from the same mouse species.
He suspected that the difference was related to microbiomes of the intestinal gastrointestinal tract, the normal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
When the intestinal DNA of mice was examined, six species of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were given to mice grown in sterile environments that did not have intestinal microbiome and did not develop immune cells, they started to emit.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They increased Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in fluid and transferred small amounts of fluid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells evolved into cells that strengthen resilience.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptofan metabolism, known as indol-3 milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptofaan in mice nutrition, the number of cells that strengthen resilience rose by about 50 percent. When the number of tryptofaans was halved, the number of cells fell by half from earlier.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, people have the same resilience cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuters in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptofaan by-products from Lactobacillus reuteri cells can develop in humans in the same way as mice. However, those suffering from irritable bowel syndrome have detected genetic defects related to tryptofaan.
"We certainly want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation in the intestine of salts," Cervantes-Barragan said.
"High levels of tryptofaan, combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria, may contribute to their generalisation."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a "genius" in their ranks after concluding a deal with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a "genius" in their ranks after concluding a deal with Nemanja Matic. The player on the pitch debuted in the ranks of Manchester United in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for £40 million, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin, United's last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed as a defensive player against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not in the best shape yet because he was not on the Asian tour of the blue shirts before the season began. He was doing just 45 minutes on the pitch - according to Mourinho, it must change before the Premier League season begins.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and mindset make him a genius - he has a natural football mentality," Mourinho says.
"We help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
Not only Matic, but also newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were starting the game at Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho started to slit his starting line-up for the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants three new players, even though the club has already done a "fantastic job" by acquiring three of his four priority players.
"Three out of four - you have to give thanks to the club," he added.
"I am happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
The flight attendants tormented Germany for two instalments
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost its fourth straight match of the World Cup qualifying tournament to Germany 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The routine level of play in Germany is high.
Their game was steady in every sector, Finland's head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a news release.
In the first two instalments, Finland kept her opponent at bay, but in the third, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the group.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to keep up, "Kangasniemi said.
Finland's most effective was the 14 points collected by Piia Korhone.
Three of the four defeated Finland will face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: grand jury has already sent challenges to Trump Jr's Russia meeting
In the United States, a grand jury has sent challenges to Donald Trump Jr and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in connection with the meeting.
The grand jury convened by special prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent challenges to the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for her Kremlin connections.
This is reported by the Reuters news agency, which at the same time confirms the information that the Wall Street Journal revealed earlier on Thursday about the convening of a grand jury.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent out challenges in connection with the meeting between Trump Jr and the Kremlin affiliations known as the Veselnitskaya, which took place in June 2016.
Also present were Donald Trump Sr. Paul Manafort, then campaign manager, and Jared Kushner, current adviser to the White House.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington is tantamount to intensifying the pace of the investigation in Russia.
The sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to assist in the investigation, which seeks to investigate Russia's interference in the US presidential election and whether the Trump campaign or his entourage cooperated with Russia in the matter.
The grand jury expands Mueller's rights to gather evidence, send challenges and compel people to testify valiantly.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury will weigh the evidence cleared in the prosecutor's investigation and decide whether charges should be brought.
The British inventor microchipped himself to get to his home and car with a hand swing
The British inventor is the first to microchip himself across the country so that he can open his home outside the door, get into his office and start his car with a hand swing.
The microchip is between the thumb and index finger of 33-year-old Steven Northam. He now provides service to companies and individuals who want to make life easier with Northam's BioTeq technology.
Northam is cooperating with Harts Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester to consult with anaesthetist Geoff Watson to ensure that the installation of the microchip meets medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technique as the microchips for cats and dogs, and the installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company will also change the locks of houses and cars to be compatible with the microchip. Handling one lock costs £300.
Northam is married and has one child. He has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
Last month's decision by the White House to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn airport of the White House for an American production event cost taxpayers $24,000. The information appears in the military documents obtained by TIME.
The Green Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the President is on board. It was a attraction at the White House on 17 July 2017, where American building programmes were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials looked at the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, there were samples of a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi.
The White House military office had asked the helicopter to be on duty only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern turf for an "extraordinary" event. This is reflected in the documents of the Navy's HMX-1 helicopter ship.
"I just wanted to make sure that you are aware of this, because it is an extraordinary event that gets a lot of visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 unit wrote in an email message to his superiors, an assistant.
It was reported that the helicopter would arrive at the southern turf airport on 17 July at seven in the morning and the event would begin on three afternoon. The helicopter would only leave after the grass ground was cleared between six and nine in the evening.
In addition, the message said that if the helicopter were to be delayed from the White House, another crew would be needed because of restrictions on service time.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the incident, and the service's security personnel were in the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents obtained by Time magazine whether there was eventually a need for another crew.
The US Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state assets for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 questioned whether the event violated the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act. We were told it was not a crime," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the deputy comendant replied.
Made in America was an official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President spoke in favour of health care reform and more lax state regulation, which had been discussed in the Senate at the time.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their travels,
But using them only for photos is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled out a presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor's presidential plane on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which presented products from all 50 states produced by American workers from American materials," said White House press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train on the Southern Lawn to bring the president to the White House with centimetres to check.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings for the White House.
According to one official, the flights to Made in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
On that day, the helicopters were also flying for 11 hours in "non-presidential support roles."
According to the White House, the incident did not cost taxpayers any more.
Sikorsky's spokesman said that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter presentation on the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 has no accounting of flights related to the President's duties, and it is difficult to assess the exact costs of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence's 2017 hourly compensation for the VH-3D helicopter is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to documents from HMX-1, the flights from Quantico's base in Virginia to the White House and back went on for an hour.
According to the White House, the cost of using the helicopter is far lower.
"Calculating the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," Walters said.
"The estimated level of compensation includes personnel, maintenance and many other so-called sinking costs that will be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 study by the RAND research company, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to present American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and are likely to employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is perfectly appropriate to bring it up. "
It is not certain whether Trump was in the helicopter during the event, but at least he was sitting in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
At the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky squadron.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."

Venezuelan state prosecutor calls for the right to block the appointment of the country's new representative
The Venezuelan state prosecutor has applied for a court ruling that would prevent the appointment of the country's new representative.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the elected representative of last Sunday's vote is to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, the country was elected a representative, who can, among other things, amend the country's constitution.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the obstruction decision has been requested because of suspected electoral fraud.
Ortega has also started an electoral fraud investigation.
He appointed two judges to the post after the British company that organised the parliamentary vote reported that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the actual number of voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated for the seat, and the 55-member delegation includes, among other things, Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to changing the constitution, the assembly can dissolve the opposition Congress and change the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the drafting of the constitution as a way for Maduro to strengthen his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro, calling it a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have declared that they will not recognise the new representative.
Maduro claims that the new assembly is the solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela the unrest has been going on for months.
Many people have been injured and more than 100 have died.
Venezuela plunged into an economic crisis after oil prices dropped.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to speak out on Friday, when the new assembly is to begin.
Russian man extradited from Finland sentenced to 4 years in US prison
A Minneapolis court in the United States on Thursday sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senah to almost four years in prison for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a US request.
According to Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been holidaying in Finland.
He was arrested by Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland handed over Senah to the US judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian objections, the AFP news agency reports.
He was found guilty in March this year of computer fraud, which had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah received 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah is expelled from the country after serving a prison sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry blamed Finland harshly after the arrest and said the man should not be extradited to the United States.
In a statement, Finland and the United States were reprimanded for making the arrest in Finland without knowing Russia in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which took tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to catch user names and passwords.
The fraudsters then used the data to further control internet traffic, which was used to make clip scams and spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, director of the Justice Department's criminal division, the case shows that the United States is capable of chasing other active cybercriminals.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco said in a press release.
Edited at 20.58: correct the litteration of the name of the sentenced person.
Narcos third season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so the Cali cartel is up for the main part in Netflix's hit series
Although the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed during Narcos' second production period, Netflix's series is far from over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth season of the series will be seen. The third season trailer has been announced and presents the new villas of the series.
During the third production period, the US drug police DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world's richest drug trafficking organization.
The Four Godfather organisation operates "like Fortune 500," except that there is a little more corruption and violence by the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages contacts with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) works in New York.
In a recently announced trailer, Pedro Pascal is returning Javier Peñana, who recruits American and Colombian police in the war against drugs.
The new faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third production season begins on 1 September.
Kari Kola carries out an extraordinary work of photography in Paris
The estranged photographer Kari Kola (pictured) carries out an extraordinary work of photographs for the first Light Day set by the UN in Paris on 16 May next year.
Kola works a photo art in Paris called Day and Night.
The theme of the book is light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The building at UNESCO's headquarters in Fontenoy and the Globe monument on its front is illuminated.
I want to highlight not only light but also darkness.
Today, the light pollution of millions of cities is a major problem affecting the well-being of all of us.
My art enables me to make the things I have felt important in concrete terms, says Kari Kola, the photographer of his work.
I am well taken from the invitation to be involved in the first International Light Day and bring the light art into the theme day, "Kola continues.
Kari Kola was present at the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when she was at the UNESCO headquarters to mark the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to be able to recreate my skills at UNESCO headquarters, Kari Kola says.
The work may well expand considerably.
We will inform you about this later in the autumn, "Kola continues.
The aim of International Light Day is to highlight the importance of light to mankind and to raise people's awareness of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Light Day will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on 16 May.
Two men fight in the car park of the shopping centre in Espoo
There was a dispute between the two men in Espoo in the car park of the shopping centre Big Apple on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute started when the other party accidentally drove a prohibited driving course.
There was a verbal dispute between the drivers.
The driver who drove the banned vehicle would be swamped by the driver of the other car, and as a result this car got off and crashed into the car.
He then knocked the bonnet of a car that had still collided.
The man admitted to causing the damage and doing the wrong thing in the initial address.
The headline in question from Timo Soin: "after the flood"
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (uv.) on Thursday published a blog post titled Question Time.
The writing is short, just two sentences.
In my time, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven members of the ruling party.
After that there was a flood of water, now everything floats, Soini writes.
Soin's text contains references to 17th-century France.
King Louis XV or the madame de Pompadour of this mistress are known to have used the waterfall analogy.
Depending on the interpretation, the history books have been left with the utterances "after us," or "after me, the flood."
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women
The elections will only be representative if they can vote for all members of society, including women, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Dr Nicholas Haysom, interim head of the UN relief mission, said that there are hundreds of women standing for the provincial council elections, three women are seeking vice president and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," Haysom said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The provincial council and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban have made threats to the elections at a time when international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's elections are the first time that power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that the women's contribution strengthens democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

Flood of certain kinds of tourists threatens the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local fury is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister for Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: there are only a few hours at the site and large numbers of sights are rushing through.
Venice is on a fast day trip to tourists in the city.
It is difficult to move through narrow streets and the great squares are so full of visitors that the people of Venice are no longer fit.
They have been forced to move ever further away from the historic centre while hotels have been replaced.
The New York Times and the Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
The authorities are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the current phenomenon of low-quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you are given two or three hours.
Follow the ticket guide from Piazzale Romalta to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and roll back, describing Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini's prevailing and causing problems.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in place, shops and workshops.
We need to maintain this part of our urban identity.
St Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit the historic Venice Centre.
On the edge of the square is St. Mark's Church.
Local anger also mainly affects cruise ships.
There are no more than 50,000 local residents in Venice's historic centre.
In 1951 there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives residents away.
About 2,000 residents leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years Venice will not be like tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who organised the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, because the ships bring Venice the revenue it so desperately needs and create the need for many jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution has been to make cruisers go further away from the historic centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, said the situation would certainly change if the Veneto administrative district, where Venice is situated, had more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Around 20-30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
Are you driving around in Kuopio?
Highway congestion for miles
On the motorway between Kuopio and Lake Siilinjärvi, the northern lane has had mileage congestion from Thursday afternoon work.
There is a motorway trekking in the area, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
There is a limit of 50 km per hour on the roads, rather than the usual 120 km per hour.
In the 50-kilometre restriction area, however, traffic had moved at a practical walking speed in some places on Thursday afternoon.
The road work took place on Thursday afternoon on the side of Lake Siilinjärvi in the case of the Ilmestys statue, the golden caterpillar.
I am doing well without such attention
The 23-year-old runner has had to notice the public curses.
Amalie Iuel has published fantastic pictures of herself in the landscape of the Grand Canyon, among others.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in Norway in her current country, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record of 400 metres in March by touring the track at 51.81.
A month later, he improved to a record 400-metre hurdles in Norway at 55.38.
Soon after his record, Iuel, who uses social media hard, found that celebrities and the public have their downsides.
Men around the world started sending pictures of Iuellle's sexual organs, apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account to outsiders.
I got a lot of "crash photos" from unknown people, so I had to turn my account into a private one, Iuel told VG.
In the interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what pictures he got.
You can probably guess, Iuel laughing.
It is nice to have feedback after the race, but I get on well without that kind of different attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
Her mother is Danish, a Danish-Norwegian father.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalien was 2 years old.
When Amliet was 12 years old, the family moved to Namibia first because of the father's work, then to Pakistan.
Then it was Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, returning to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is training with three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to talks than the United States.
In the United States, the coaches do not ask anything, they just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal with the athlete personally, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records at 400 metres and 400 metres in the hurdles.
The foot injury put the whole career of snowboarder Janne Korven at stake - now involved in the World Cup: "nice when it does not happen"
Now it has been nice to count when nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, who is one of Finland's most successful snowboarders, has been able to enjoy her loved ones again this season.
Last summer, a career was still at stake.
The leg injury had forced the ears on the operating table in January, and the leg did not want to heal.
The hand had also taken hits on the track.
In the summer, I did not know what to do, whether to continue singing or not.
Sponsorships were on the break and many things were open, Korpi says.
But it is said that things tend to get organised.
The leg improved, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and the blood started to pull back to the slopes.
The follow-up decision was then easy.
I knew it at the latest when I was in your first snow.
I was that bloody, it is so much fun, it is still pulled through a couple of months.
It was not until September or October that the Korpi got down properly, but after a long break, it has been a big deal.
There have been only a few rounds of the games.
It does not matter.
The competitions have never been the most important aspect of the song for the ears.
I have never fallen for one game.
I find it frustrating to aim for four years at one of the games, and then have a fever of that week.
I do not think so, "says Korpi.
Today, the ears at the halftime of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though the individual games do not keep him on the song, he always breaks out in hard company.
According to Korven, the prestige of the International Ski Federation games has increased in recent years, even though some of the plates chose the Norwegian X-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important games, visibility is big.
However, for me, the appreciation always depends on the conditions and level of the games.
In Sierra Nevada, Korpi is the oldest athlete of Finland's 12-person team.
The team pit, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than their ears.
It is nice to watch the younger guys go.
I remember when I was myself at that point that everything was new and was so sick and enthusiastic about everything.
It brings a new flow for itself, "says Korpi.
I still stay on the slopes somehow, but otherwise I do not, that much is in the guys' flow!
Janne Korpi has also built a different sporting career in the background.
The son of guide legend Pekka Korven has gone into racing: the plaintiff has his own horse racing program.
When I am in a rucksack all the time, there is no time to be in Mass.
But every day I look at the nutrient results at least and usually at the starting point, Korpi says.
Horse racing and racing are a potential career plan, according to Korven, when the surfing career comes to an end.
I am not bothered to plan that far, but it is at least likely.
I feel it, as if I were studying it along with snowboarding.
I try to keep up with the nerves of time and develop in the summer, and perhaps start with something.
If it is my future profession, then it will not be difficult to start when you are already inside the species.
Ravitas also includes the Elitloppet racing cruise with presenter Jaajo Linnon.
The couple have rented a cruise ship, which will head to Stockholm at the end of May for the Elitloppet racing.
Korpi and Castle decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has traded well and people have been enthusiastic.
Now we are at the point where there will be no bankruptcy.
A few months on, let's hope to get the ship full, "Korpi says enthusiastically.
Attendo's care home project for Crystal has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of Crystal's new care home for people aged 41.
A building of over 1,700 apartment blocks will be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre's neighbouring health centre.
The general theme of Crystal's wonder is where the new treatment unit will suffice for the customers, because now, during Siu's war, many private nursing homes are overcoming customer shortages.
Anne Flink Attendo, regional director of care services, commented that Crystal will have increased demand in the future not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Attendo bought private care homes from Kite in Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The transaction concerned the business, but the property is known to have a five-year lease.
Flink says there is no urgent need for Attendo to move operations out of these facilities.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand in Scotland
The trade union is seeking confirmation from the leaders of McVitie's inventor of long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to the Scottish department of the GMB general trade union, the company has not reported on its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea plant has more than 500 employees.
The Plades company, which owns the McVitie's brand, said it had invested more than £5 million in the plant in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives "will be the first to be told" if changes are to be made.
In a letter to the factory manager, GMB urges the company to "respond to concerns that there is no funding for the modernisation of production lines."
Drew Duffy of the GMB trade union says it is extremely worrying that the manager of the factory does not have clear information about the needs of Tollcross's business and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has focused heavily on the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area. The factory is a major employer in the region of high unemployment and low income.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, and Brexit, rising living costs and a continued reduction in production, Eastern Glasgow desperately needs a successful McVitie's production. "
According to a Pladis spokesman, the factory manager had received a trade union letter only the day before and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates the continuous interaction between employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of issues openly.
Among other things, we discussed with employees that, like other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain market, we are constantly evaluating all our business operations and offices to maintain our competitiveness. "
According to the spokesman, the company has invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant in recent years, particularly in its production lines and improvement operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a manufacturing plant and we will certainly be the first to tell employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the plant's operations."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret his interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain will not relinquish Neymar's claim after paying the £18m transfer fee for terminating the contract, but did you warn PSG Barcelona about a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational move is the most talked about case of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record for transfer sums. The previous record was less than half that: it came about when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer fee of £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's best paid professional athlete, with PSG offering him more than £500,000 a week after tax.
Barcelona are known to be furious at PSG's behaviour and the way Neymar has forcibly left the club. A source close to Barcelona says that Neymar has been very concerned about the club since he arrived at Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG chairman warn the football world about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced their interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser al-Khelaifi warned the best players in PSG to pursue clubs.
"I am not worried because they know that if they are looking for our players, we will become their opponents and we will contact their players," al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they want our players, they will have to face the consequences. "
Barcelona seem to have done just that: it expressed its interest in PSG player Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona are therefore losing their star player Neymar.

Now: the Trump phone calls were invented - White House spokesman: "I would not say it was a lie"
The White House acknowledges that the two phone calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump were never met, says the New York Times.
Trump's phone calls with both the Mexican President and the leader of the Boy Scouts Association have proved to be invented.
White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that there had been no phone calls.
But he said Trump did not lie.
According to Sanders, many of the leading scouts spoke to Trump in person, and with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieton, Trump had discussed Hamburg at the G20.
I would not say it was a lie, it is quite a hard accusation.
Those discussions took place, not only on the phone, but face to face, Sanders argued.
Speech to scouts sparked outrage
On Monday, Trump said that the Mexican President phoned him and praised Trump's success in eradicating illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few people will cross the southern border of Mexico, because they know that the trip will in any case be blocked along the U.S. border.
The Mexican government issued a news release on Wednesday saying that that call had not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico released a full version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump gave his speech at a major meeting of the National Scouts Organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts, he said it was the finest speech they have ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump said.
On Wednesday, the Boy Scouts Association reported that it was unaware of any of its executives' calls to Trump.
According to the press release, an earlier statement by the organization's director, Michael Surbaugh, in which he had apologised to the Scouts for Trump's speech, speaks for himself.
Trump's speech at the meeting of the Boy Scouts' Association caused a lot of puzzling, because it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he spun the results of last autumn's presidential election.
