Camille Auer wanted to fix her gender, was diagnosed with a mental illness and now she's doing art on the subject - "a person should have the right to their own body."
Dozens of patient reports hang from the ceiling of the Project Room Gallery of the Academy of Art.
Each of them reads Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell the perennial story of how outside people have written up their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell my personal medical history to make the violence of the process visible," Auer says.
With the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It's often a years-long period of research that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process begins with a series of "gender identity disorder" diagnosis studies carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, she had used the estrogen she ordered over the internet and was already well advanced in her own repair process.
She felt she was a woman, but under Finnish law, a person has to go through the repair process so that the gender can also be repaired legally.
The Transgender Act (563 / 2002) requires transgender people to undergo forced sterilisation in order to obtain the right gender, for example, in the census and passport.
At present, anyone who repairs their gender is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of incapacity.
People have the right to decide on their own bodies.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
The reform of Translaw has been talked about for a long time in Finland.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight comments on the law and the European Court of Justice has a preliminary ruling obliging the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right of self-determination.
The last Finnish government prepared a change to the law under the then Minister for Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huovinen.
There was an election and the natives came into government.
Now, the change in the law is stuck again.
These are internal political disputes that are not even related to this particular law.
"The government doesn't want to put it on the table because of divisions within the government about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, executive director of Amnesty's Finnish department.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One consists of packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the psychologist's interpretation of Auer at Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a report on the basis of these, which would define Auer's right to care and assistance.
The sense of reality to be studied appears to be susceptible to wavering.
The researcher's perception of himself appears to be fragmented in a border-level way and the unstable characteristics of personality are highlighted.
Auer did not identify himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear I was diagnosed with a mental illness," Auer says.
An even bigger shock was when Auer was not granted gender repair treatment.
Medical staff said his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
That's when, on February 11, 2015, ­ Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked a transpoli waiting list for a television hack.
Later, an artwork called Monument for the Excluded emerged from that television, in which Auer reflexes his experience of power and using it.
"It's crazy that any person who is defined as a woman at birth can magnify their breasts, but you need a diagnosis to remove the breast," Auer says.
Your body is not your own if you feel you are anything other than the amount of your gender determined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one of its kind.
For many, the gender repair process is more severe for spiritual reasons than purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people who need to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who are in need of support and assistance are being denied treatment, citing the fact that their resources are not enough," Auer says.
Many people who have applied for the process have psychological symptoms: Depression, anxiety, potential bullying experiences.
On these grounds, medical staff can order that no treatment can be started.
"Preventing access to care and assistance can plunge a person into an even worse situation than what it was before the process started," Auer says.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I've had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and it's something that people tend to find hard to digest."
Depression has been treated with drugs and when Auer started using hormones, feeling relieved.
He had been able to finally say the sensations that had existed since childhood and teenage years.
Why the wide jaw didn't seem to fit into your own body and why the chest ­ muscles had to be round instead of flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people around him to see him.
To be seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using sound and movement," he tells me.
Today, Auer already feels like he's going to be seen, he exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, random comments from loved ones could hurt a lot.
What hurts the most is when loved ones are abusive.
"They should know and they know who I am, but are not willing or able to internalize it," he continues.
However, not all transactions require physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body dispute, in which the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, there can be no official confirmation of their own gender.
"There is no medical justification whatsoever for these investigations," Auer says.
And that's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal gender.
The new legislation is based on sovereignty over the legal sex.
The adult applicant makes a written application for a new ID, saying in it that he feels he is of a different sex.
After a six-month cooling-off period, the applicant will confirm his application in writing and the Ministry will issue a new ID.
This sovereignty is also required in Finland, and this demand is summed up by the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for an artist; the exhibition is a collection of political and artistic works.
I want to believe that art still carries weight and can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.
Camille Auer exhibition Antiphallic Dick from 4 to 28 July 2017 in Project Room of the Academy of Fine Art.
Civil rights organization issued travel warning for Missouri
The national NAACP organization, which advocates for civil rights for AfroAmericans, has issued a travel warning for Missouria due to discriminatory practices in the state and racist attacks there.
"The NAACP travel bulletin on Missouria takes effect on August 28, 2017, and calls on Afro-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling in a state where there have been numerous questionable racial events recently," according to the organization's statement.
The law, which recently came into force in Missouri, makes it more difficult to export cases of discrimination to court, and the enforcement of state laws disproportionately targets minorities.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They will be stopped based on skin color and beaten or killed, "NAACP Missouri President Rod Chapel noted to the Kansas City Star.
"We have not heard of as many cases before in such a short time."
The travel bulletin on Missouria is the organization's first warning for the state of the United States.
The organization cited as examples the racist comments against Afro-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee, History Sanders.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year, driving through the state when the fuel ran out of his car and was arrested by Missouri police despite not being charged with a crime.
The travel note also referred to the Missouri Attorney General's report that police are 75 percent more likely to stop a black driver than a white one.
"The purpose of the travel bulletin is to urge people to be alert and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People need to prepare, for example, by including money to pay guarantees or telling relatives that they intend to travel through the state. "
According to the FBI, there were 100 hate crimes recorded in Missouri in 2015, the sixth highest number of US states.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it harder to sue companies for discrimination in housing and employment.
The ACLU, an organization that defends civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after passing immigration laws obliging police to arrest people for immigration offences, which it says will increase racial profiling.
Generally, travel warnings are issued by the State Department and apply to other states, but recently they have been published by NGOs in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for an explanation of the CEO's supplementary pension
Mika Lintilä (Feb.), the business minister responsible for corporate governance, has asked Finnair for an account of the additional pension contribution received by the airline's CEO, Pekka Vauramo, according to Yle.
It is at odds with the expression of the will of the state, according to the minister.
An additional €130,000 pension received by Vauramo surfaced this week, with the Helsinki message reporting on remuneration developments for directors of listed companies.
Finland's Kuvalti reported Vauramo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said it would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has indicated that supplementary pensions will not be used to reward.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
The company said the decision was in line with last year's policy decision on ownership management.
Sanctions immediately hardened speeches
Until recently, it appeared that relations between the United States and Russia were on their way from cold to warm.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met on the sidelines of the G20 meeting of industrialized nations in Hamburg, seemed to be getting along very well with each other.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions approved by the U.S. Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were met with friction in Russia.
Tyrmöv's response so far has been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who said the Trump-signed sanctions law amounts to a "full-blown trade war."
While Russian reactions would only be described as escalations and excesses of political rhetoric, the tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact of life after a brief honeymoon after Trump-elect.
In the United States, the passage of the sanctions bill on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Admittedly, Congress passed the law with considerable consensus, but for the president, the passage of the law was far more difficult, according to reports.
Indeed, Trump recently criticized the law he signed as "significantly flawed."
President Trumpi's cladding may have been caused by Russia in particular, although the adoption of a law limiting his own powers must also have been disgusting.
As is well known, there is an investigation in the United States into possible Russian meddling in the presidential election as well as the Trump-campaign's ties to Russia.
The tension between the United States and Russia is a fact of life after a short honeymoon.
As White House staff have changed in stride and various scandalous turns have been revealed to be almost updated, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States under the leadership of the President, but in spite of the president.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is a buzz in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region of the Baltic Sea is straining relations.
The EU has played a prominent role in Ukraine's relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy towards Russia, at least on the face of it, the Member States have very different interests.
For a member country like Finland, which does a lot of trade with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real rift.
The effects of the recent US sanctions law are still unclear.
There have been fears in the EU that the sanctions will make it more difficult for many European companies.
In Finland, the effects can be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, and possibly in the Fennopower nuclear power plant.
Pollution in Europe has been caused by the fact that, for example, liquid natural gas, which is important for the US economy, has been excluded from the sanctions.
Trade sanctions are a means of world politics as a means of expressing disapproval.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought out and subject to scrutiny.
Otherwise, they can easily do more harm than good.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trumpi's White House now has a Statue of Liberty in its sights
Tackling Patsais is the surest sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as anyone else: The Iraqis, along with American soldiers, toppled a statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump-administration's chief ideologues, knew well what he was doing in a heated argument with CNN channel Jim Acosta, a statue of freedom that was attacked by Miller in a war of words over the president's proposal to dramatically reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't exactly criticize the statue itself.
Had he done so, he would have been attacked by huge loads of cruise organizers and characters imitating the Statue of Liberty.
The object of his attack was the significance of the statue, especially the addition in 1903 of a poem by Emma Lazarus -- 17 years after the statue was completed.
Here's how Miller slammed Acosta: "I don't want to go any further into history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller was not wrong in itself, but it's not just about history, as he said himself.
Essential are the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones of their kind in which the state calls not only immigrants but "the poorest of the poor": "Your tired, your son, / Your huddled masses yearning to break free, / The wretched refuse of your theming short."
The poem is now more topical than ever.
Miller was by no means a literary critic; he made it clear that the "poorest of the poor" are not welcome in the Trump-US.
The dispute over the meaning of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural dispute about the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus's friends campaigned for the poem to be captured at the foot of the statue, knowing full well that the act was deeply political.
The statue was intended to reflect the links between French and American republicanism with a classic metaphor, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: In his poem, the female character is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: The mother of the deportees.
Linking the poem to the image was an ingenious feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
Rush Limbaugh -- a front-runner who can now be seen as some kind of prediction of Trump -- claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Freedom does not present an invitation to anyone, but is an early frontrunner for neo-conservatives, taking America's torch to the world covered in darkness: "Lady Liberty steps forward.
He takes the freedom to torch from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch will not show the way to the United States. "
Unusually, Limbaugh was partly right.
The significance of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on your point of view.
Lazarus saw it like poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and testing journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people seeking shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty is comforted by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's absolutely not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torch does not show the way, fuelling the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
General Sports World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots reached the British national team
Neil Black, performance director at the British General Sports Federation, says the 16 Scots members of the national team taking part in the World Cup are a "significant confirmation."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Sports Championships, which begin in London on Friday.
According to Mr Black, "something special is happening in Scotland" that British public sport needs to learn from.
"This is welcome and we will continue to study it for so long that we understand what is at stake," Black says.
"I spoke to representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sport and they thought it was related to its activities.
The Scottish General Sports Federation, on the other hand, believes it is related to the union's activities,
And the British General Sports Association believes it is driven by their actions.
And the regular street taller thinks he must have something to do with it.
However, it is something quite awesome, whatever it may be. "
Many Scots athletes will compete in London in earnest for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000-metre run; Eilidh Doyle, meanwhile, was chosen as captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly gorgeous, "Black says.
"Athletes left the event, proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they happen to live and practice.
Eilidh's words had a genuine feeling and passion for sport. "
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medallist at the Commonwealth Championship in a 400 metre race, and these are his fifth world championship, and he thinks it is "unbelievable" that there are 16 Scots in the national team.
The previous record was seven from 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Laura Muir has run five British and two European records during the year.
He will compete at 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres in London.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 metres in London and it is worth keeping an eye on him too: The man has an excellent season behind him, including wins in the World Cup qualifiers in Great Britain and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first world championships, when the only Scot in the national team to join him was Lee McConnell.
The national team captain says he is "immensely proud" that so many Scots are involved, some of whom are seriously competing for final places and medals.
"Being a captain is a great honour anyway, but it's even more special because the national team members voted captain," Doyle says.
'i'm obviously very proud of all the Scots who got into the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes competing for awards.
My captain's speech?
I think it went quite well.
I focused on how lucky we are to have a home Games.
It's important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere is going to be mind-boggling. "
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't stand for public office if you can't stand criticism
The father of our country knew what is bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but newspapers soon began criticizing him for everything from possible domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism certainly irritated,
But he did not silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led as stupid and silent as sheep to be slaughtered," Washington said in 1783.
That brings us to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
At least 450 comments have been deleted and blocked by Hogan's staff on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued Hogan in court earlier this week.
His staff thought the challenge was unfounded, and the attitude was dismissive online as well.
"What does it matter? This is just Facebook," many people commented.
But the issue matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of a state dominated by Democrats.
He has received the second best reviews of his activities among 50 governors.
Hogan is not delicately responsive to the heat.
He has led the state firmly and stood firm on principles.
He has also been proficient in using Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents and has published a photo of a squalid head in chemotherapy.
That's why blocking users who come to the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous.
Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, which she said was all about modernizing the comments.
Branding commentators as trolls, sneakers or haters, however, is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their elected leaders, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They told me that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and decent.
In his comments, the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Maryland, was not hostile and asked a question about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a position on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in comments to the Washington Post news.
"I also find it unacceptable that, when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately regarded as some sort of organised force and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments a "concerted attack" and someone else might call them an important step forward.
In the age of Facebook, it's easy to manage communications by blocking a critic or removing critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers that had published critical editorials or to arrest and silence protesters.
Really, though, it's the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of shackling Facebook and other social media channels.
He has been taken to court by Twitter users blocked by President Trump.
The first major decision was made on the issue last week in Virginia.
According to Judge James C. Cacheris of the Alexandria District Court, the Loudoun district government violated the first addition to the U.S. Constitution when it blocked a voter on Facebook.
And the American Civil Liberties Union went to talk to Matt Bevin, the Republican governor of Kentucky, about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This should not be difficult.
At the time of Washington, cheap postal charges had a similar effect to the Internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and Washington was hammered by anonymous authors.
Back then, there were trolleys.
Names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to newspapers in which they blasted Washington's decisions.
The president's office was flooded with petitions criticising the Jay Agreement, a cooperation, trade and maritime agreement between the United States and Britain, according to documents collected by the Papers of George Washington.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the foundation stones of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about a dozen places, plus online reports of a couple, three.
Most of them have come from South and Southwest Finland, but then also individual Haapavesi and the Seine River, according to specialist Marja Isomursu Evira.
The green peaks have died from a parasitic disease called trikomonosis.
It is caused by a primitive animal called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to hit doves, and most of them into trouble.
In the 21st century, however, the disease was also found in pepper birds.
In 2009, we got off to a very good start.
At that time, trikomonosis caused a major collapse in the green pepper stock in Finland, and since then the species has been able to recover.
There have now been sick green peppers, but at least not yet on a large scale, according to Juha Honkala, museum director at the Central Museum of Natural Science (Creation) at the University of Helsinki.
The fear is that the last outbreak of green peppers will recur again unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: Stop summer feeding birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty is hoping to benefit from a home field advantage at the Renaissance Club
Former European number one player Ronan Rafferty is hoping to benefit from a home-field advantage for the next three days, with the Renaissance Club in East Lothian to host the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Rafferty, from Northern Ireland, led the tournament at the neighbouring Archerfield Links field last year before the final round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is pleased with the new venue and will serve as an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of the club's founder and chief executive Jerry Sarvadi.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and this event will bring it to its full glory," says Rafferty.
"The players see the field at its best. It is in great shape.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He is an enthusiastic ambassador for the game and he is proud of his achievements here.
The tournament is a wonderful showcase for this field. "
The Englishman Eales will defend the championship for the first time, despite having won both the European tour and the European challenge tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a really special opportunity," says the player, who lives in Southport.
'i wasn't able to defend my victory at Extremadura Opens because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It is wonderful to return here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come to mind: The tournament win was a fabulous thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember. "
Gary Orr will return to action on his own soil, who went on to join the tour after completing 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing at home is always more important than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and played pretty strongly.
I'm happy with my game so far. "
The trio will be joined on the pitch by former Masters winner Ian Woosnami and seniors major-tournament winners Paul Broadpiont, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots will attend the tournament: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Car parking costs £5 if you only have a driver in the car, and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
The village was looking into possible indoor air problems in the barracks
In the village, at least so far, no indoor air problems have been found in the barracks building of the Pori Brigade, the brigade was told on Thursday.
Indoor air investigations are still continuing.
The investigations began when a man who suspended his military service for health reasons thought his health had deteriorated due to poor indoor air in the barracks.
Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holman, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, said there had been no problems with the health situation of the other servicemen.
It turned out it was an isolated incident and there have been no health problems for others who served in that unit.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to get to the bottom of this.
It is not known at this time that we have any indoor air problem, "says Holma.
The brigade's press release says that due to the July arrival period, goods must have been moved into the barracks, which has allowed the dust to increase momentarily.
The air may have seemed crowded as a result, Holma notes.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold country
Bardina Degei doesn't use hello in cooking.
In fact, he rarely uses it.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotalissa, the capital of the Paniai region, which is located in Indonesia's troubled province of Papua.
After half an hour, the bait burnt on the cart is greedily eaten with bare, unwashed hands.
There are no furniture in Degei's home; she sits on a muddy painter, where she usually also takes care of her daily tresses, such as fishing washing from a nearby swamp in slick water.
The toddler's posts are supplied by a bucket in a roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives and has not been assigned fields to deal with.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: Most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many people drink a lot.
"No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening," Degei says.
This is a rare throttle to everyday life in the Papua Highlands, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969, preceded by a controversial referendum that forced the price of 1,026 villages to vote in public in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch rule, quickly turned its anger at Jakarta's government, which is holding the region firmly under control and preventing foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, the eastern part of the island belonging to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is remote and a colony. The journey there begins with a one-and-a-half hour flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabiree and continues with a five-hour drive wrestling the stomach on board a rental car.
There is no public transport here.
The city, with a population of about 19,000, has wooden houses surrounded by bambufs, with wave pelvic ceilings of rust coloured into basement brown.
Few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Papuan Mee Pago tribes worshipped the Uga Tamee god.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have these kinds of clothes," says Degei. He means his colourful, hand-wrapped boiling head, dark skirt and brightly coloured buffer.
"Before, we had only leaves to cover our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of the population live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it's also the gold of Indonesia.
Paniai is about the size of New Jersey with 153 000 inhabitants. Only about 100 kilometres from Panama is Grasberg, the world's largest and most productive gold mine, owned by Freeport McMoran, based in Phoenix, the United States.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery because they mean the suffocating presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and local units of the military between 1998 and 2004.
Papua's calls for greater autonomy threaten this source of income and are ruthlessly silenced.
Human rights activists say that since 1969, the Indonesian military has killed more than 500,000 priests and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the Papua tribal highlands in the 1970s took on the dimensions of genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the area during peaceful protests.
The Brisbane Archbishop's report We Will Lose Everything from 2016 includes accounts of atrocities from the previous year, including executions without trial, torture -- rape and electric shocks are particularly popular means -- and relentless attacks toward peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are cases every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Screws have been tightened as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million people in the province, 83 percent are Christians, but the demographics are changing as Indonesia's populous islands of Jaava, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi migrate to the region in the hope of a better livelihood.
Jaunty warung food chefs sell fried chicken and a gado-gado vegetable mix in a peanut sauce.
It's hard for locals to compete.
"The migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables on the market at a lower price than the locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Panama and moved to the provincial capital for work.
"Local women lost their customers."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo -- nicknamed Jokowi -- promised during his 2014 election campaign to address the injustices and human rights violations in Papua.
Papua is made up of 29 regions, and this former chef won the vote in 27 districts, including Paniai, on his way to Jakarta's presidential castle.
But little has changed in Papua, and locals feel let down.
"Our hearts were shattered because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," You says.
Paniai experienced some kind of wave base just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs near the doll in Enarotalise on December 7, 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use headlights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned to the scene with four soldiers.
According to reports from victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers captured the children and assaulted them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of the assault.
A couple of hours later, the State Electoral Commission building near the scene was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand Pakistanis -- young men and women and children -- gathered on a football pitch in front of a local police station and an army command center to demand justice.
They had hunting strings for party menus with them, and began performing the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, dancing in the ring and imitating the bird song.
Some protesters began stoning police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere got hot, the soldiers were given an order in the internal radio system: "If the masses of people are resisting more than three times, shoot them dead."
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the resident director of the Kego Koto area, expected the situation to get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen any more.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist," he told TIME magazine, with a whisper of his wooden house painted in bright colour.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of soldiers.
"A number of shots were fired in the middle."
He was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," told Yohanes TIMEs with sadness. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I shouted at him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that officers only "protected" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"Then it is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
Information about the killings was carried to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, expressing condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately, so that nothing like this ever happens again."
Security minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would launch investigations into human rights abuses outside the justice system.
However, he immediately began to withdraw his speeches.
"Most of the violations took place a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The bottom line is that we have decided to investigate the breaches, but that requires certain processes, "he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind, saying he did not intend to start investigations in Papua.
"Everything will be sorted out in court," he told me.
Wiranto is accused by the UN of 'crimes against humanity' in connection with the death of more than a thousand people during the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999.
The families of Paniai victims take a grim disbelief at the allegations.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," says Yohanes.
"I'm already tired of this."
He says he is still living in fear, even though it's been years since the event.
"Yes, I'm afraid," he says.
"I am afraid of being arrested by the army. I am afraid of being shot. "
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Shiites do not dare to discuss the event.
He says he had been beaten by soldiers when he had helped bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after the burial of the victims," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighbouring region of Paniai, Deiyai.
One was killed and 17 injured in a conflict between villagers and the head of a construction company, which started when the manager refused to take a man who lost consciousness to hospital, including children.
The man needing hospital treatment was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been put on water while he was fishing in a nearby river and died on the way to hospital.
Angry villagers demonstrated at a construction site in front of the company's office.
According to police, the villagers stoned the police, who responded with warning shots.
However, according to locals, a mobile police unit of Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, killing one villager.
"We are terrified. We are afraid of retribution," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw as the wounded were brought in for treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
Deiyai parliament has called for police officers who fired shots to be held to account and a mobile police unit to be pulled out of the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development is fuelling discontent among the Mee-, multi, Dani and Damal tribes who live on Papua wheat in the central highlands.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of clergy with occasional attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Panama, like Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Paniai in the name of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some of those arrested will never return.
Among the clergy, Paniai is known as a "sad, forgotten place."
Poverty breeds discontent.
Enarotalissa has little rice for sale, and even that is too expensive for locals,
Like bread.
People grow their food themselves: Mainly batates and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Cultivation is women's work, and one woman may be responsible for four or five batate fields.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the rest is sold on the market.
Ten batates cost just 10,000 rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the livelihoods of locals and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs, and they tend to go local to better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Only a few pageants have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own business in a competitive manner.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work, no money," says John Gobai, president of the Paniai tribal council.
Remote Papua gets little attention in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua despite having been granted a rare filming permit, the official reason being the inability to engage with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises; he has not increased transparency and has not promoted development by lifting restrictions on news coverage.
"Journalists reporting on Indonesia's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua face new risks: Refusing a visa and being blacklisted," Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is only under pressure from Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states -- Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands -- called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "numerous and widespread violations" of Papua, including the Paniai shooting scene.
These states have traditionally also supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia remains a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations."
The locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When the official Dutch delegation led by human rights envoy Kees Van bar visited Jayapura on May 4, 2017, locals broke the silence and expressed a desire for freedom, according to an anonymous source who attended the meeting.
There is a presidential election in Indonesia in 2019, but the pageants tell us that they are no longer likely to vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is good, but there are people around him who are embroiled in Paniai's shooting scene," says Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know the situation of the people of Pakistan: They live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in destitution and poverty, virtually without access to health care and education.
According to Gobain, panitans, like any other papal, see their votes to Jokowi as a "debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Paniai shooting scene once again showed resistance metaphorically: They buried one of the victims on the opposite end of the police station and army headquarters.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family members were killed," Yacobus says head in print.
"What else could we do?"
Dereck Chisora gushes about the cancellation of Robert Helenius's rematch: "Even our own fans don't want to see."
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to take place on May 27 at the Hartwall Arena.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora wears the blame for flaunting the rematch entirely on Helenius's shoulders.
My take in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him play because he's miserable, Chisora bores.
Helenius and Chisora first met at a full Hartwall venue in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial points verdict.
Ticket sales for the rematch went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match had been postponed until the autumn.
Nothing new has come out of the match.
The cancellation, however, is no longer annoying Chisora.
After all, the match would probably have had to be cancelled anyway after Chisora was ill.
On Thursday, three days before the date of the match, I woke up in severe pain.
My Tyre was about to explode.
The hospital said I had to be cut, Chisora says.
The Briton says he is currently in about 45 per cent condition.
By all accounts, he is not interested in a rematch with Helenius, with Dillian Whyte in his sights.
Chisora suffered a defeat to Whyte in December by a split vote.
Fire took over for the second time the Torch skyscraper in Dubai
Flames took over a residential building in Dubai, one of the highest in the world, on Friday, with hundreds of residents forced to flee a 79-storey building 337 feet high.
This was the second fire in two years in a building that happens to be called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied and no one is known to have been injured and the cause of the fire was unknown immediately after the incident.
"We were sleeping and woke up to the sound of a fire alarm and people's screams.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes, "a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai rescue authorities said fire crews had the fire extinguished at four in the morning local time and were left cooling the building.
The government said it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The incident could reignite questions about the safety of materials used on the outskirts of tall buildings around the world.
After the 2015 fire, the board of directors of the Torch building commissioned a study that found that the plates used for facade shrapnel and insulation were the most affected.
In Britain, police believe the insulation and vermouth plates at Grenfell Tower in London could contribute to the rapid progress of the flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a makeshift parking lot during the night
A moped was stolen from a makeshift parking lot between 2pm on Tuesday and 5pm on Wednesday.
Mopo disappeared from Nine danger at Tikkmäentie 2.
Mopo was branded Sky Team Monkey.
It is red in colour, and the registration number is 27-REV.
Mopo was found later on Thursday.

In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers take prohibited items on board, reveals survey
A survey of airline passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had taken banned objects knowingly or unknowingly to planes past the US Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints; at least 6 percent of passengers had knives or other items with steel that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one per cent said they only found out afterwards that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition or explosives.
More than a thousand passengers responded to the survey, carried out by the Stratos Jet Charters charter airline, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely than others to flout the rules.
19.7 per cent of passengers who knowingly violated TSA rules were Y-generation representatives and less than 15 per cent belonged to the X generation.
Most commonly, the rules were broken by taking food and liquids on board the aircraft.
In addition, 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men said that they knowingly took banned drugs on board the aircraft.
The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many people had accidentally taken smuggling goods past the security check and how many had done so knowingly.
Unsurprisingly, most travelers are also most likely to take contraband goods past security checks -- knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that conducted the survey notes, TSA's instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids are allowed on board and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of the TSA's seizures are liquids.
For a while, there was also a belief that books should not be taken on board the aircraft.
Liquids may be taken to domestic flights but not international flights.
The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, reversed his decision to delay decisions made under Obama to reduce emissions
A day after 15 states had sued Scott Pruitt, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in court, Pruitt withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken under the Obama administration to reduce emissions that cause smog.
Pruitt said the change shows that the agency he runs is more sensitive to the needs of environmental policymakers in the states than previous administrations.
Pruitt made no mention of the lawsuit brought against his previous decision in a federal appeals court.
The states should start complying with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone from 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would defer the implementation of decisions by a year to allow his agency more time to familiarise itself with the plan because the agency "does not want to interfere in local decision-making or hinder economic growth."
Pruitt was a public prosecutor in Oklahoma state before he was appointed head of the EPA by President Donald Trump, who is known for his opposition to stricter environmental regulations.
Since coming to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to block or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback for Pruitt's plan to ease regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA director overstepped his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's decision on oil and gas companies, which obliged companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday night, Pruitt argued that his U-turn on ozone regulations will only strengthen EPA's cooperation with states in the complex process of meeting new requirements on schedule.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for it to be taken to court by activist groups and others to reach an agreement on schedules," Pruitt said.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation and take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it gives us. "
However, an EPA statement said Pruitt could continue to use his "powers to delay the implementation of decisions as well as other legal powers" to ensure that the regulations "are justified and based on the best available information."
Republicans are pushing for a broader change in ozone regulations in Congress.
The bill passed last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, the New York State Public Prosecutor who led the consortium of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group planned to keep up the pressure.
"The EPA's change of heart as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6.7 million freshmen and more than 115 million Americans exposed in their communities to the direct effects of smog," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the complaint included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, reputation, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground level ozone is created when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants, for example, react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
This type of smog can cause serious breathing problems for vulnerable groups of people, and is also responsible for thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists welcomed Pruitt's surprising change of direction.
"It's worrying how much pressure was required for the guy in charge of our breath to use common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trumpi regime, whose ideological aim is to act on the basis of polluters and other self-serving groups."
Supercars manufacturer to become street trailer - "happening in Ferrari style"
It also plans to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to hold on to its expansive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in the style of Ferrari, Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said of the plans at a press briefing on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be unveiled next year as the Italian supercar maker presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News reported.
All East Savo measles cases of the same type of virus
Rantasalmi measles infection is the same type of virus as previous cases in Eastern Savo, informs THL.
The Virology Laboratory at the Institute of Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that Eastern Savo's fifth measles infection is the same strain of the virus as previous infections.
THL has ensured that the measles infection, which was confirmed by a ranked person on Friday, July 28, is the same type of virus as previous cases of East Savo.
On the basis of this information, all of the infections detected in eastern Saavos are linked to the first measles found in the area in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not seen any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that new infections can still occur in the wake of the fifth person affected until mid-August, and so the outbreak is not yet over, says Mirkalena Erkkilä, a physician in charge of infectious diseases at Soster's primary health care.
No new measles infections or their suspicions have come to light since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important for everyone to take care of the timeliness of their own vaccination protection. "
More on the subject: Three new measles infections were confirmed in Pirkanland - "further infection or epidemic very unlikely."
Finland prepares for authorised kilju making
Pontika soup was not even considered to be legalised.
The underlying argument that the process produces a vibe along with methanol, which is toxic.
Making Kilju at home will be legal next year, but legalising pontika soup is not even considered.
Kilju is produced by fermentation, the pontiff again by distillation.
The rationale behind regulating distillation is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, along with the vibe.
There has been no political will to make the soup of the pontiff a right of public access, according to a comment from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the ministry prepared a reform of the Alcohol Act, the pontiff distillation was not considered to be legalised.
Nor was it brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the release of the monument, according to Mr Outi Mäkelä (Kok).
He is in the negotiating squad of the parliamentary groups of the governing parties, which took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
In the future, you will not even be able to grant permission for distillation at home.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain licensed.
It tells us that there will be a simple rule for the domestic manufacture of alcoholic beverages: Alcohol may be produced at home by fermentation.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally make a kilo at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes requirements for flavour and flavourings and allows the production of sprat, Mäkelä explains.
Production has yet to take place in such a way that the raw materials, or the flavourings and flavourings produced when they are used, are clearly visible in the drink.
Under the new law, drinks can be prepared as much as they like, and alcohol can be given as a gift.
It is still not allowed to be put up for sale.
The act of Kilju is no longer a public health problem in Finland, he believes.
A much bigger change occurred in 2004 with the release of passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries.
75% of the alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The Alcohol Bill is now under review by the Department of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will come before Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law will take effect in early 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It's as if the parliament has already taken a stand, Mäkelä delights.
Oscar Pistorius rushed to hospital, escorted by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from breast pain, was rushed to a South African hospital for heart attacks.
Pistorius has already got out of hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence at the Atteridgeville prison.
According to the British Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning, escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered chest pains, but he got out of hospital this afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to hospital for investigations.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family, meanwhile, reported that the former top athlete is in order.
Last summer, a six-time Paralympic gold medallist was sentenced by the Supreme Court to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Steenkamp was shot by Pistorius in February 2013.
Littered phone conversations reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build border wall
Litteres of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked to the Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on January 27, 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nietoo to stop his public speeches about not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States rang Nieto for knocking out the wall project in public. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall along the US southern border at Mexico's expense.
The Washington Post also published a litter of Trump's first phone call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during which a tense exchange of words took place.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the US would take refugees on their way to Australia was "ridiculous," "miserable" and "stupid," saying the deal negotiated under Obama would make him look like an "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the United States.
Mr Trump ended the call by saying to Mr Turnbull, "This was the most unpleasant call all day."
Georgia massacre: Activists re-staged racist lynching in hope of justice
A Ford Mercury branded car overlooks the crowd in the small town of Monroe in rural Georgia and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
The car has four black and white passengers and a white driver, four armed men blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the crowd, a middle-aged man dressed in a railroad suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and steps through the windscreen.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n---u!" The man yells.
'Ulos from the car! '
Screams break the silence as a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
This shocking event is thankfully just a restaging that aired on July 22, 2017.
However, the sighs of shock are genuine as the hanging loop is squeezed into the neck of "Roger."
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to reclaim the events of 1946, when the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black and white couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been prosecuted for the murders.
"It is baffling that no one has been arrested over these years -- even though the murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps organise the restaging.
"It is a disgrace of history, but above all it is a burden that weighs on our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia congressman.
For him, restaging is a startling call to action; it also reminds the people of Monroe that injustice has never been fixed.
"We want those responsible to be brought to justice, we want to see things finally brought to an end, and we want to recover from grief and reconciliation, but above all, we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make reconciliation until we get justice."
A death investigator covers the body of a victim killed in a Georgia massacre on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI documents obtained by NBC news, more than 50 men were suspected of lynching in Monroe and surrounding counties.
However, no one was charged with murder.
While the culprits have been free for decades, activists say the motives of lynching have always been known to locals: Politics and sex.
In 1946, black people in the state of Georgia were given a Supreme Court decision to vote for the first time in a presidential election.
The FBI said there was an incident at the time of the election in which black rental farmer Roger Malcom stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently involved Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, it was rumoured that Hester had had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting a child for this.
According to FBI data, influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid $600 guarantees on July 25, 1946, against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were joined by their cousin, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
Their car was stopped by the crowd before the Moore's Ford bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and organised the murders," according to an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities, which were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
"It was a voting rights murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to the black people that the same thing will happen to them if they are going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has directed a restaging of the Georgia massacre for nearly a decade.
The motion is extremely realistic and captivating; it is a description of the appalling racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States today.
It's hard to look at the performance, but it's even harder not to look at what Green says is meant to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our own dark sides," the director says.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or don't want to hear what I have experienced."
The exercises in this year's performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors -- a dozen black-skinned and twenty white -- gathered to listen to Greene's plague summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh serves as assistant director for Greene.
He has presented a local Ku Klux Klan leader in relegation for years, but the role is always just as difficult and disgusting.
"There's going to be a dirty feeling because I'm not myself," Marbaugh tells me.
"However, it is important that this aspect of history is maintained so that it never happens again."
On the other side of the room, they are practiced by Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, or Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The performance begins with a scene in which Malcom screams and yells at Hester, who is furious that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothy.
"Did you not hear? I said," Get out of my country, n---u! "
Rascona, or Hester, responds.
Then you leave the betting.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!" Rascona asks.
He is confused.
"Did I accidentally find too strong?" He asks.
"You don't," Greene heels.
"I just don't think whites used the word n---u at the time."
"Yeah," another black actress confirms.
"It's slang. You need to use a longer version."
The subject of the performance is uncomfortable, but the room is dominated by cronyism.
Everyone wants to succeed, and not just because of the performance; they want to honour the memory of those killed.
The scene starts from the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are sickening.
No one is laughing.
The reshuffle will end quickly and violently.
Screaming, shots -- and silence.
A woman wearing a black funeral outfit stands beside the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice is shattered with every other word.
A few dozen metres away, fifty spectators are wiping sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost exactly half of the audience is black and half white.
Among them is a couple who have come to see a performance from Ithaca, New York State, but most are local.
They have visited Brooks with guidance on victims' graves in the oppressive humidity of Georgia.
The murders have turned the story into a reality, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the singing performance, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
The children are teaming up to watch the artificial blood and unmoved bodies and whispering to each other.
"They are not really dead," the little boy grins, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the audience.
The actors, who presented the lynchers, stripped off their signings and wiped away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who presented the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough performance.
"No problem," the woman involved in the performance comforts.
"We know that you are not him.
You did this for a good reason. "
Later, the audience and actors gather for a joint dinner.
A white couple from Altanta are busy discussing the performance with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it hard to find words when she describes the feelings aroused by the performance.
"It's hard to listen to horrible words and watch terrible acts that are said and done by people who look like you -- just because they look the same as you," he says.
"I noticed that lynching is still taking place, " he added." They are just called arrests. "
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights to listeners seated at the same table.
He says he has already started planning for next year's performance.
"Recharging is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also an educational experience," says Brooks.
"The message is that this could happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it. "
Depended on vegetables in stores is stirring: This is what the removal of 'extra parts' actually saves
Is it permissible to remove the floral leaves already in the shop before weighing in?
What about taking away a large part of the pineapple - no matter how much it weighs?
The answers strongly divide opinion: For one, it is an expression of extreme embarrassment, while others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that they do not use and which, however, go into the bin at home.
Yes, the phenomenon is recognized in stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket vegetable department of Ruoholahe in Helsinki, because many people, for example, tear off the leaf parts of the flyer.
Out of the box, the leaves are taken to the store's biowaste.
According to a news report published by economics, snapping at a vegetable counter amazes traders.
But how much does removing the extra parts of vegetables before weighing really save you money?
How significant is the sledgehammer really about?
Us Women tested how the price changes when pineapple, latva artisoka, peach mushrooms, asparagus and blossom take out leaves or strains.
Flyer: The cost of the flyer, which costs €2.10, was €1.80, while all the leaves were loaded out of it.
Ananas: The price of an entire pineapple costing €2.30 tipped to €1.95 when its stock was tipped off.
Lava Artist: The price of €2.60 came in at €2.40 when the short-lived stock cut off.
Herb mushrooms: Two peas cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Asparagus: Medium asparagus cost €1 and without carrying 80 cents.
The end result: If leaves and strains go to nod off, save a few dozen centimetres at best for one of the vegetables.
In percentage terms, the price of vegetables fell by as much as 20%.
So these purchases would have saved a total of €1.20!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - a brash solo on a five-year deal with PSG
Brazil star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, according to AFP news agency.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, who play football in the Spanish league, an exit price of 222 million euros.
The huge transfer sum of €222 million is the biggest in football history.
Previously, the record was at Manchester United, who paid €105 million for Frenchman Paul Pogba last summer.
The Spanish league blocked the move earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first attempt at payment by Neymar's representatives.
Under league rules, a buying club cannot pay an exit price directly to the seller, but the player himself must buy out his contract, which is done by recycling money through the league.
In practice, PSG have paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives, who provided the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to be arriving in Paris on Friday.
He will be presented to a potential new home audience in PSG's season opener against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA will examine the details
Barcelona also said in a statement that it would provide details of the payment to Uefa, the European Football Association, to allow the union to determine any disciplinary action that may result from the incident.
Among other things, Spanish league president Javier Tebas has suspected PSG are breaching UEFA's financial fair play rules with their spending.
UEFA can punish a club that makes more than €30 million in losses over three years.
UEFA said Neymar's move does not automatically violate its economic clauses.
Neymar's move to PSG will have an impact on the club's finances for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for substantial sums, Uefa was informed.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned qatari company.
The club will be chaired by former tennis professional, qatarian Nasser al-Khelaifi.

Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from a lightning attack - a stampede recorded in the airport's turf
Austin Dunn was doing ordinary work measures on a plane at Lounas-Florida International Airport with a couple of colleagues when suddenly a lightning plane was struck by the rainy sky.
The force of lightning threw the plane into the ground of Dun, near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to hospital.
He had third degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and said the brother received an electric shock and he is in hospital.
I just asked him if he was alive, "says Austin's sister, Autumn.
Austin spent two weeks in the sairalaa.
In addition to burns he had muscle damage and a brain haemorrhage.
The experience was tough for the whole family.
You can't expect that.
It's traumatising for everyone, "she says.
An airport representative said the lightning warning system was on at the time of the incident and the carrier itself will decide whether to comply.
Pearson to cut 3,000 jobs and revive business by cutting dividend
British education group Pearson announced on Friday it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut the dividend by 72 per cent as it launched a new restructuring program in response to pressure on its business.
Chief executive John Fallon said job cuts will mainly be made at the end of 2018 and early 2019.
Pearson announced it would again cut costs by £300m in May as part of its third austerity programme to revive the business, which has been weakened as a result of rapid digitisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann, which announced it would keep its outlook for the current year, with revenue increasing by 1% in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber struck a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, where authorities say a NATO soldier was killed and several others wounded in the attack.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in Kabul's Qarabagh district.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month and on Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in an attack by a suicide bomber at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to a NATO statement, the explosion on Thursday night occurred when a joint NATO and Afghan army patrol was attacked by a "personal explosive device carried by a person."
The statement said all the injured were in stable condition and were treated at a US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of an ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are major concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
The UN says at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, including 20 per cent in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul in an area mainly inhabited by Shia Muslims.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the final day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in downtown Kabul, the country's deadliest attack by a militant faction since US-led forces toppled the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the volatile situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump considers whether to send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's trust in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses its decision to delay implementation of smog regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken during the Obama administration to reduce emissions that cause smog, a day after 15 states had sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 so-called "ozone regulations" late Wednesday, a decision the agency said demonstrates its commitment to working with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and want to meet the needs of the states," director Scott Pruitt said in a statement from the agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the agency's intention to delay the implementation of the ozone regulations by one year until October 2018.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 states, mainly controlled by Democrats, including the District of Columbia, which said it was illegal to delay the execution.
President Donald Trumpi's administration has been looking for ways to mitigate the environmental regulations under Barack Obama, who said the measures are part of a broader economic growth agenda.
Trumpi's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists worried about the health effects of increasing emissions.
According to the EPA website, inhaling air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
One of the leading figures in Isis had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.
There were suspicions that the bomb was to be taken to the plane on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before a security check.
Police will not elaborate on why the company was interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a device containing toxic colourless gas and take it to a crowded public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were apprehended in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation also continues.
Liquor CEO: Renewable fuels did well
The oil refiner's fluid profit before tax fell but slashed forecasts in the second quarter.
Chief executive Matti Lievonen said the company made a good profit on oil products, sales volumes for renewable products rose to record levels and the development of operating profit in the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by a tax break for Blenders Tax Credit in the United States.
Lievose said operating profit for renewables remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and a more favourable market, although tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and will complete our previously announced strategic investments in 2017, "Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatchenko discuss possible match in their first meeting
Vasyl Lomatchenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the immediate future of the under-66.7-kilogram series, first met on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the premises of the ESPNs sports channel in Los Angeles until WBC's undefeated light-heavyweight champion Mikey Garcia walked along the corridor to greet Lomatchenko, the WBO senior featherweight champion.
Garcia won at Showtime on Saturday with the unanimous decision of former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner, and since then Garcia and Lomatchenko have been in the top five on a list comparing boxers in different weight categories.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and asked, "How do you go, Master?
Good luck with the match! "
Lomatchenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPNs at seven on Saturday.
When the duo posted to photographers, Lomatchenko's manager, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the match between the men would be "perfect for sizes."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
'i moved the series above [63.5 kilograms] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small to 63.5 kilograms.
I want to go back to the lightweight series.
He has to get up in the lightweight series [61.2 kilograms]. Then we can cook.
That's what our fans are hoping for.
Let us fulfil their wishes. "
Lomatchenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this match."
Klimas asked whether the match should be held on a payment channel, part of his strategy for Lomatchenko to debunk in a lightweight series later this year, and to match Garcia (37 to 0, 30 knockout wins) next summer.
"The match could be on the pay channel because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later declaring he was ready to match on the channel, which offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else will attract as much attention.
It suits me as soon as an agreement is reached... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomatchenko as "an incredible match" and was maybe going to go and watch Saturday's match.
Lomatchenko interrupted the praise of Garcia and said that this champion of three weight classes from Riverside looked "really slow. Sori, Mike... but you needed that knock."
Garcia said he first focused on showing the force of the attack and then boxing.
The men said they felt there was a growing appetite for a match between them.
"This is the match that is expected.
No other match will attract as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case, "Garcia said.
Lomatchenko said that he expected to be able to match the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's going to be a great match. '
Average salary of €5,300, training what happens - the investment advice situation was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has talked a lot lately.
Most recently, the Helsinki Sanomat reported Ritva, 68, to whom the banking movement's investment advice spoke full cheek when selling investment products.
The rules on investment advisers and the sale of various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
They are based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisers and employees selling investment products is based mainly on self-regulation.
The law has not defined skills requirements.
The financial sector (fa) itself recommends that those working in the investment service complete its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorized the organisation of qualifications for a company called APV Investments Ltd, which has experts from financial supervision (Fiva), universities and industry.
The exams are 12 to 15 credits, and their exams are prepared by wave EE, a wave of University Executive Education Ltd, which provides business management development services.
Its website says that, in general, both exams are "quite extensive in terms of requirements."
The teaching materials for qualifications include 10 to 15 books and numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, managing director of APV investment degrees Ltd, says that the rate of passing exams is roughly 70.
Of the staff of the largest banks, roughly all those providing investment services have completed either an APV1 or APV2 degree because their performance is mandatory under their own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers, without mentioning names, whose staff seem to have avoided completing their qualifications, Savikko says.
He said there were "a few such banker movements."
According to Savikko, between 13,000 and 14,000 people have completed APV1 degrees since 2000 and around 3,000 more demanding APV2 qualifications recommended for investment advisers.
Some bankers believe that completing a degree is an advantage.
A number of other industries have significantly higher skills requirements.
Savikko says that a recommendation from the financial sector requires the completion of APV qualifications, because it is then that expertise in the investment sector is secured.
According to the Bureau of Statistics, on average, financial and investment advisers earn several thousand euros a month in commissions, including in-kind benefits and performance fees.
The average earnings of regular working hours on monthly wages are approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men in positions earn more than €5,900 a month and women earn more than €4,500.
The tenth of those who earn the most earn an average of around EUR 8 100.
A tenth of men earning the most earn more than €9,000 a month or more, a tenth of the women who earn the most earn €6,400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
So far, there has been a reliance on self-regulation at employee and task level.
According to Fivan, the audit it carried out received individual cases where the expertise and competence of an investment adviser was not sufficient on the basis of the adviser's actions.
In principle, you can also be a seller of investment products, even if you have a low level of professionalism and competence.
As a matter of principle, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other industries have significantly higher skills requirements, Savikko says.
According to Savikko, from the beginning of next year, this will be strengthened by the new MiFID II.
It requires that each company is responsible for ensuring that staff providing investment services are sufficiently skilled.
Financial supervision, on the other hand, will have the power to determine what needs to be done.
Marko Hovi, Fiva's market watchdog, says that one of the clear changes to the current one is a piece of legislation on skills and experience requirements for investment advisers and sellers of investment products.
According to the court, the new requirements will apply to both investment firms' own staff and bonding agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
Hovi says that, according to a government proposal issued by the Treasury, Fiva will be empowered to determine knowledge and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided with these prospects in the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, monitoring and further training.
All of this has to be documented, and the company has an obligation to show that this has been done.
Hovi specifies that, in practice, the company must, for example, map out the work of the staff at the individual level.
This will certainly be subject to different standards, depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to the court, what is also new is the requirement to work with someone more experienced than the deadline if knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
In other words, if a company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the specified criteria, the employee must work with the person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the court, with the change, the rules become stricter and more concrete.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened in early 2018.

The route flown by the aircraft was drawn over the United States in the service of Flightradar24.
The flight was conducted Thursday on a 787 Dreamliner plane to test the durability of the plane's Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane, which left Seattle, flew a distance of 15,700 km in the space of 18 hours and 1 minute, longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in the world.
The flight remained within the borders of the United States throughout the journey.
It flew through a total of 17 states.
Imatra's resilient bracing schoolchildren are not instantly soaked by rain or sun frost - Iines All Polski persisted with help from a swimming village
The Iines all moved forward at a good pace, Taika Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach schools will revolve around Liette and Lempuka this week and next.
Although sometimes it rains and then shines again, the young bathers are not the same, praises the swimwear school promoter Taika Itkonen.
This week's swimming schools will have a total of 13 children, a dozen next week.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that the school and nursery will begin, according to Itkonen.
The Imatra bracing school is organised jointly by the Physical Integration Project and the city of Imatra.
On Thursday, there was a nice atmosphere at the sludge beach.
The sun was shining and the young swimming schoolchildren were training on the surface to keep up with the swimming dumplings, someone already in the air.
Smaller siblings also thrived in the water.
Iines from All, 5, first thought of going deeper into the water.
However, Tever-Itkonen encouraged him to kneel towards the beach.
!!!!!!!!!!!!
Iines All said he went to a lot of swimming this summer.
The sludge beach is good for him.
Like Iines All, the swim dust village was persistently engaged in swimming with Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You, too, will be pleased with today's achievements, the swimsuit praised.
Jami rock, 4, on the other hand, wanted to water down at times.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, to swim from the beach, thinks the beach school is a good start for learning swimming.
Although the weather has been what hurts, Anna has been rallying every day to go here.
Sometimes you had to warm up.
Swimming school children packed onto the pasture.
The boys had enough to touch with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Lukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pasture, snapped fruit and toast the day.
Already in the water, the teaching continued, but there was no rush on the pasture.
Kind of when you don't belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier sells water exercises - "Here's the kind of unifying story."
You can see all kinds of it.
A couple of days ago, Sinuoe, which makes cleaning products, launched an unknown soldier product series.
So counter training and catch scaffolding - as well as a "toilet brush on the edge brush."
The unknown soldier refers to the film, which premieres this fall, and the marketing of the clip.
Yet there is something special about the mix, and products have been grounded on social media: When will the Tuntematon-health ties come?
You have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, vice president of Blue product, say?
We are a partner in the film.
We are supporting this film, as are many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, "he says.
According to him, there will be a special presentation of the products, and the film will thus gain prominence.
Isn't there something a bit funny about this - often when you think that the products and the stories attached to them have something in common?
Yes, this is such a unifying story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, "he says.
He said that the company supports his basic Finnish values, which are supported by those who have seen the old unknown soldier.
And cleaning up is no stranger to military culture, "he points out.
Other business partners of the unknown soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and harvest.
To date, for example, Hartwall's vichys have been placed on the market.
Kalle Kinnuni, blogger at Kuvalehde in Finland, has already had a record of tuntematon products
Coffee and watches are also already available.
Kinnuni points out that there is still time for the film's premiere, so there is still more to come.
Unfamiliar partners have not yet revealed their war products, for example, Valio, processor, liquor and German retail chain Lidl, Kinnuni writes.
New results of Sweden's asylum seeker age tests announced
The latest results of the medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been published, and the results of the tests carried out by the new evaluation method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were determined to be over the age of 18, but not everyone believes that they are reliable.
Sweden's national forensic agency began testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Migration Agency was criticised for failing to determine the true age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Immigration Department has commissioned 6,880 tests so far, and the forensic agency has now released the results of 2,481 tests that were conducted between mid-March and late July 2017.
Of the 80% tested, the 2002 asylum seeker was determined to be over the age of 18 and, in 25 cases, the forensic agency determined that the test was' possibly 18 years old or older '.
432 cases concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under the age of 18."
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to doubt the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson from the forensic agency says the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"The numbers are fairly consistent; there are no big differences in the statistics of the previous months," he told The Local.
While the vast majority of applicants were determined to be over the age of 18, that doesn't necessarily mean applicants have lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said there were "indications in 442 cases that the investigation was 18 years old or older."
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it emerged that in 243 cases, the applicant had openly stated that he would be 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of polvinivel, then the images are analyzed by dentists and radiologists.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinian Institute, whose work includes an assessment of the biological maturity of human beings.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I think that the method used is not the right one.
Determining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we are not in a position to determine the age, we should not pretend that we can do it, "he told Metro newspaper.
However, the forensic agency Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is low.
The risk is greatest in a situation where it will soon be 18 years old to be tested.
Ilonen plummeted 30 places in Scotland
A five over par result in the third round spent Mikko Iloss's 30 notches of the performance slip down in golf's European tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen went from a place shared on Saturday morning to 11, but was found at the end of the round sharing a place at 41.
In a difficult yellow, Iloss accrued one double bog to accompany the three bogs.
Others were tricky, too.
Ian Poulter, an Englishman, came up to share the lead with one under par in the round, although he told me that there was enough work to be done with the umbrella.
Keli was brutal but I roared along and in the end it was a good day, Poulter backed up.
He shares the lead with compatriot Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
West Virginia governor changes party
Jim Justice, the Democratic governor of West Virginia, announced Thursday night at a Trump campaign event that he would change the party.
"The Democrats simply abandoned me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and deep reflection... Today I tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The audience burst into raucous applause.
"Please register as a member of the registered Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time for a new game."
Trump previously promised a major announcement would be made at a campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won by 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Mr Justice was elected governor in 2016, according to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) released a statement Thursday night saying that "Governor Justine's change of party is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, which is building barriers rather than a better America."
"Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justine's announcement is the latest setback for a party with no leadership whatsoever and unable to find a positive message that unites people," RNC Representative Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Salamat sowed damage - Thursday becoming even the very thunder day of summer
At the end of the week, there will also be more thunderstorms in southern Finland.
Over the past week there has been a thunderstorm, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes sparked several fires.
According to Meteorolog, Thursday might be a very thunderous day of the summer so far.
The deaf have finally found Finland as well.
Over the past week, there has been lightning, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and the region of Southwest Finland.
By ploughing, lightning struck the power center of the row house, causing a small fire.
Emergency services were notified of the fire about a quarter to midnight on Wednesday.
The electric centre was located in a sauna at the end of a row house.
The rescue service demolished the roof and wall to find the fire extinguishers and extinguished the fire with water.
A total of eleven homes were left without electricity, but personal damage was avoided.
On the plaque, on the other hand, lightning set the external building alight in Harjulant before midnight.
When the rescue services arrived, the building was already at a full stage of the fire, and the rescue service could only prevent the fire from spreading.
The external building, which is about fifty square metres, was burnt to the ground.
In the direction of the Kuopio, again, lightning struck a private house.
Residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flaring lightning attack.
Emergency services went to the scene to check the incident, but this time the lightning did not produce a fire - only a few melts tip.
On the road, a thunderstorm caused problems on the train line between the River Seine and Vaasa, when a lightning attack damaged the traffic management system.
Information about the fault was obtained between eight and nine on Thursday morning, after which trains in that period were replaced by buses.
It was not until just before five o'clock in the afternoon that the problem could be rectified.
Since then, train traffic has also been able to continue on a section of the track that has been ravaged by thunder.
Salamat has wreaked havoc in various parts of Finland.
Salaming, however, has been relatively low this summer.
These thunderous stuff this summer has been absolutely umpian! According to Jari Tuovinen, a meteorologist at the Institute of Meteorology.
The thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday have been mainly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low level of lightning during the summer, that, too, feels even strong for many.
This might seem like a really tough thunder, but that's what it has been compared to the thunder this summer, "says Tuovinen.
On Wednesday, landslides roared 1,700 times, and Thursday has had potential for even the toughest day of thunder in the summer: By around 4 p.m., there were 1,790 terrain in the play-offs.
If lightning continues into the early evening, then more than two thousand lightning can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record low year of thunder was experienced in 2015, when the year's amount of contraband was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, the amount of contraband this year had risen to 18,386.
So there is still catching up to do to stop this year breaking the "record" of two years ago.
However, you can expect Uksikiri to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will also remain warm and wet during the rest of the week, which is a favourable birth environment.
The main focus of the thunderstorm is expected to shift Saturday from the northernmost parts of the country to the south, where about 2,000 days of lightning can be obtained on both Saturday and Sunday.
There will be a more homogeneous haven in the centre of the country.
In such cases, according to Tuovinen, thunder only thinly.
Coe praises Russia's' open 'apology over doping scandal
World athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised the apology he described as open-minded by Russia over the doping scandal on Thursday, but Coe added that it was not yet time to end the ban on Russian participation.
Russian general sports director Dmitry Shljahtin said at the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Cup on Thursday that Russia's ban was appropriate and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry "for all the athletes who were deprived of a gold or silver medal in the competition."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to extend the ban, which was ruled out of general sports competitions in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his response today was very direct, it was a very generous performance," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and Congress welcomed the fact that the Russian General Sports Federation acknowledged that the country had gone through difficult times and indicated that it would do its utmost to reorganise its activities."
Mr Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the terms for ending the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendation that this is not the time to end the ban on Russia," Coe said.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to normalise the situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes apart from a corrupted system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete with the status of a neutral athlete at the World Sports Championships, which begin in London on Friday, having met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF task force, said Monday that Russia has yet to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
"Testing is still inadequate, and coaches who have been banned will continue to operate freely," he told reporters on Friday after a presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
The production company was disappointed by the poor success of Tom of Finland
Tom of Finland didn't become the kind of success that the authors hoped, says Yle.
To be honest, I am disappointed, to acknowledge that the film was produced by Annika Sucksdorff, executive director of Helsinki film, in an interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it looks like it is.
The film had its premiere in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached just over 100,000 viewers, which is a little compared to the film's budget of around €5 million.
There was no lottery win from this, but now it's important for investors to get their own back.
If the film had been more successful at home, they would already have got their money.
Now you have to expect small streams of foreign releases, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How football's financial rules affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The regulations restricting the spending of European football clubs do not prevent the transfer of Neymar from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germaini in France, the most expensive transfer of players ever made in football.
Its potential consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from taking part in the prestigious Champions League.
UEFA introduced fair play financial rules in 2011, saying PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's move has been funded without major losses.
Barcelona were paid €222 million to end the Brazilian's contract, and Neymar's annual salary at the new club is moving in tens of millions of dollars.
There are many economic aspects to Neymar's transfer to France.
PSG will have no trouble paying Neymar's transfer fee and linking him to his star cabinet, as the following will be funded by Qatar's oil-rich ruler.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums of money on buying players, but they need to be balanced with real sources of income so that football-related business is not loss-making.
The fair play economic rules were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platini, a Frenchman who was elected as UEFA president in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini was of the opinion that the pursuit of success through debt was a sham and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play financial rules shifted from the clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model first used by Roman Abramovitch at Chelsea in 2003 became significantly more difficult.
The current three-year evaluation period for fair play financial rules will run until 2018, during which clubs will be allowed to make up to €30 million in losses.
While Platini was forced to leave the role of UEFA president in a scandalous manner in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, also wants to curb the reckless spending by clubs.
"The rules of fair play are still in place and we will continue to apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, responsible for fair play financial rules at UEFA, told the Associated Press news agency last week.
While PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a lump sum, it can interrupt the sum in accounting for the full duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual pass of 44.4 million euros for the next five years.
On the basis of fair play economic rules, the first sanctions were handed out in 2014, with the biggest penalties imposed on PSG and Manchester City, funded from Abu Dhabi.
PSG were fined €60m, later reduced to €20m, and the club were ordered to limit their Champions League group to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is watching clubs who may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their revenue through companies linked to the club's owners.
For example, if a qatar-based company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal level of the market, UEFA will not count the aid as an actual income.
This was the case when UEFA ruled in 2014 that the Qatar Tourism Authority's support for PSG was excessive.
It has also emerged that some of Neymar's earnings at PSG could be funded by fees available from Qatar's 2022 World Cup organising committee.
However, PSG and the organising committee have denied that Neymar was being made an ambassador for the World Cup, and it would be very easy for UEFA to disclose such an arrangement.
As a result of PSG's previous sanctions, UEFA is even more closely following attempts to circumvent the rules.
Sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG over the transfer of Neymar.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on condition that their identities are not disclosed because they are not authorized to discuss the situation at PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG had a turnover of €542.4 million for the period from 2015 to 2016 and operating profit of more than €10 million.
Last season's financial statements have not yet been released.
PSG expect the arrival of Neymar to attract new sponsors and increase sales of club products and gadgets.
The club estimates that its revenues will increase by at least 30 per cent with Neymar's contract.
The Spanish league, clearly irritated by the departure of one of the best players in the world, tried to make it more difficult for Neymar to move, allegedly in breach of fair play financial rules.
"This is a clear economic doping case, both for the club and for the state," Spanish league president Javier Tebas said to Spanish newspaper AS.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state funding the operations of the football club, which is owned by an American sports pool.
"The incident is the result of ownership that has completely changed the operating environment of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the financial rules of fair play. There are so many interests associated with the famous player representing the state. "
Now Playing: Coach of Finland's World Cup athletes stuck in Helsinki
Suren Ghazaryan, coach of fixture jumper Artu Pajulahden and batsman Kristiina Mäkelä, is stranded in Helsinki, although he should be coaching at the World Cup in general sport in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulati will compete tomorrow in the quarter-finals of the pitch and Mäkelä on Saturday in the quarterfinals of the colony.
However, the duo's coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the issue in a major British show to no avail.
The Premier has an invitation from the organisers of the World Cup as a documentary, but even that hasn't been good enough to get a visa.
I wonder if this is one of the first signs of Brexit, or what, "coaching director Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always been successful in dealing with visa issues himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for years.
It doesn't make such a big difference.
As long as someone looks at the step marks in the stadium right, Arttu Pajulati said of his coach's possible omission.
World Cup medal from SuomelleLondon requires a miracle
The World Sports Championships start in London this Friday and will last just over a week, ending on Sunday, August 13.
General sports, off-road skiing and hockey are the species that Finnish bench athletes can be passionate about year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other indicators.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one valuations to another, where gaining experience matures an athlete's performance to the level that an adult World Cup medal is truly possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in Finland's small World Cup team, and it is true that there are no cones.
A World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Luckily, the interesting and surprising nature of sport is that miracles can happen, too.
It draws bench athletes to the television screen and glue to watch the Games, even if the London medals are not resolved until late in the evening due to the time difference.
From the last World Cup in general sport in 2015, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by bowler Tero Pitkämäki.
Believers expect a medal from Pitkämäki even now, although the other is evidenced by recent results from him and other cast members, as well as Pitkämäki remaining in qualifying at last summer's valuations.
Whatever happens in these games, Pitkämäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports tough.
For other Finnish athletes at the Games, getting to the final competition or making their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt for Finnish general sport over the coming years will be a great success for young people at the international championships this summer.
The processing of young talent and financial support for its work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative players.
Success doesn't come overnight but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
The Finns can also appreciate the international sports stars and enjoy their unique performance.
Hopefully, the London Games will go down in history as Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, and not because of terrorist deterrence or cowardly attacks, for example.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But it's annoying."
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has been ranked second in the big air race in Colorado, United States.
The second place at Copper Mountain is Lake Food's best in the big Air World Cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the competition.
He tried on his final jump to caballerial 1080 for the first time at the Games, and it was very close to succeeding.
It feels good and a good fielder is now, but I do regret that the last jump didn't go quite.
Yes, I am going to try it again at the Games from now on, "said Rukajärvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, a competitor jumps from a jumper made for the species.
Viking Line's new fast ship stranded in port in Helsinki
Warehouse company Viking's new fast ship FSTR is well behind schedule.
The Pika vessel was supposed to depart from Helsinki to Tallinn at 6 p.m.
The ship had eight countries with loading in progress.
The ship came to Helsinki late.
For at least an hour and a half I've been waiting to get on the ship.
Now the car queue is moving slightly, Johannes Rebane, an Estonian waiting to board a ship in the port of Helsinki, said at 7: 30 p.m.
Rebane thought there had been a technical fault with the new vessel.
Rebane said that the shipping company had brought water bottles for those waiting in their cars to board the ship.
Christa Grönlund, Viking's head of communications, says there was a technical fault with the ship.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The vessel leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says the ship will also miss the return trip to Tallinn for a couple of hours.
The ship was supposed to go back to Helsinki from Tallinn at 8: 15 p.m.

Police are directing traffic on the Circular Road, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
The shuttle will proceed along the road 13 to the port of Mustola.
A small circle of nostalgia: Wet hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story simultaneously hails both the days of the characters' 80s glory and the grunge of the 90s (in those days, David Wain and Michael Showalter made a superb The State stunner for MTV) and their own time -- 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved into their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant memory we have become bogged down in the Facebook age.
As a commercial product, it feels like a thing of the past.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humour (among other things, it told the story behind the vegetable cans speaking in the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
At the heart of the joke is that middle-aged actors play the luscious teens approaching adulthood.
Ten years later, in which adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: It parodies, for example, the Stalinist cliffs of the '90s, such as the horror movie hand that swing the body.
At one point, one of the characters digs up the Apple PowerBook, inline rollers and "other stuff from 1991."
Many of the stories are the same as in the past.
The good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has still not got over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot includes Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) as his accomplice George H. W. Bush (aptly played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best are side paths.
It is particularly fun to see the iconic Paul Rudd, who has a partatupsu beneath the lower lip, or Matt Dillon's "Soul Patch," from the movie Singles.
Moments of random madness may elevate this series to flight as a kind of repulsive Seven Up! Series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet hot American Summer -- Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends go to the premiere of Wet hot American Summer.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series, on the other hand, appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: The Cold War spirit of the Americans, the Atomic Blonde film and even the weight image of the GLOW series, where East meets West.
The comedy series was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and directed by Rhys Thomas.
In the main parts, as the coveted Gregor and idealistic Iosefina is seen by Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici.
It's a great idea,
But it is not much more than that.
The series has some good visual jokes (police officers spend time watching chess on television in the same way as Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali, and Chloë Sevigny.
The Comrade Detective, however, gets too caught up in the imitation of a clumsy socialist drama -- involving, for example, a killer hiding behind a Reagan tape, which is why the series often really starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
The six long episodes are too long and the humour of the series is neither quick enough nor rich enough.
In summary, the series might work better as an agitprop satire, say, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby to greet hamburgers.
The message to the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into consumer goods and fast food.
The fictitious Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: We were greedy for our own recent history and their history as well.
Kouvolan Toni Tauru is up in the ring in Macau on Saturday - facing a former UFC match
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match up.
Toni Tauru will face a tough bone in Macau, as Brazilian Leandro Issa was still in the UFC organisation last year.
The Brazilian also has a drunken black belt and a world championship for the species.
For once, I match myself against a parent.
It's a funny thing, "says 32-year-old Tauru.
Kouvolian was supposed to get up in the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three struggles were quickly brought to Macau, the autonomous region of China.
Tauru hasn't encountered that before.
This was the first time my match was cancelled.
It was annoying, as it took a lot of time to prepare and train.
However, the viewer is pleased that a new date has been set for the struggle.
Waiting for a week will have little impact on preparation.
The move will not affect the condition, as it will not improve in a week.
The condition can get even worse if you practice too much now.
In his past few fights, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths lie in setting up.
This time the situation is different.
The Issa hooker describes as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive tackler.
I bet he will come on hard in the first set and try to take to the carpet.
He's won the gossip world championship, so he knows how to press.
Kouvolian's previous match did not go according to plan.
Philippine Kevin Belingon hit Tauru badly in the corner of his eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I've never done that well, especially standing up: He didn't get any hits.
When I set out to knock down, he hit my eye.
It annoyed for a really long time.
New motivation
Some free-riders match once a year, some rise to the ring more dense.
For example, Issa, a future opponent, last match in September.
Tauru, meanwhile, had three matches last year.
We are now facing the second battle of this year.
At times, the pace has become pregnant.
I've been training in recent years and been in good shape all the time.
However, I have only been doing it for the sake of the match.
After hearing about the upcoming encounter, the 32-year-old decided to change the landscape for a while.
I was in Espoo training and regained the joy of doing.
We got some really good training when there was one guy from Sweden as well.
Training was a great help, as on Saturday the hooker will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I've got to train against opponents of the same size and practice a vertical match.
Indeed, standing upright is the 32-year-old's main tactic.
You have to hit sensibly.
If there is an opportunity, I will, of course, go to the plot.
They must not be given free of charge, because they are the ones who consume the most.
Macau attracts Tauru, who was in China in the past.
It's reportedly China's Las Vegas.
I think there will be a big and great evening ahead.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce it will keep interest rates unchanged amid sluggish economic growth and easing inflation has ended speculation about interest rate hikes.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow, shifting interest rate hikes due to increased pressure on families' incomes.
The decision makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Commission decided by 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%.
In its four-year inflation review, the bank lowered its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7 per cent and its 2018 forecast to 1.6 per cent, and it also warned that household income levels are under increased pressure as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate to close to 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank said interest rate hikes would be needed over the next few years to curb inflation driven by Brexit, adding that borrowing costs could have to be increased more than expected in financial markets.
In addition, members of the commission decided to cancel part of the massive economic package, which began to take place a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The bank will close the Term Funding scheme programme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide low-cost funding through the program to banks £15m more, or a total of 115 million.
The minutes of the Bank's interest rate decision state: "According to the forecast of the Monetary Policy Commission, the slow development of gross domestic product will continue over the next few years as the fall in real household incomes will reduce consumption."
On interest rates, the bank reiterated the need for "some tightening of monetary policy" in order to curb inflation, "slightly wider than market expectations."
Markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
In May, the bank forecast growth of 1.9 per cent for this year and 1.7 per cent for next year.
Now it kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8 per cent.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Against the dollar, the pound weakened 0.5 per cent to $1.31; against the euro, it weakened 0.4 per cent and stood at 1.11 euros.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after weaker than expected growth figures muted increased expectations for interest rate hikes. GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter but pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope to households hit by rising inflation and meagre wage rises, with the bank saying the situation will get even worse before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" a drop in revenue over the next few years, but expects wage growth to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be bolstered by strong growth in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which will reverse some of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was made a year after interest rates were reduced to 0.25 per cent following a shock EU referendum result that plunged the pound down.
The bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be reflected in prices and the economy only after four years.
Before the central bank's latest decision, interest rate hikes had become increasingly vocal as inflation ratcheted up pressure on households, with three policymakers calling for a 0.5 percent rate hike in July.
Last month, inflation eased to 2.6% from 2.9% in June, but the bank said it was expected and inflation would tighten again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the excess of its 2% target was "entirely" due to the weak pound.
"Given the recent fall in swaps rates, competition in the mortgage market would appear to be getting even tighter as lenders hotly seek customers and want to end the year strongly," says Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The markets are looking particularly good for those whose current loan deal is coming to an end.
NHS orders 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
As of September, patients can be prescribed a "turnaround" HIV prevention drug, and a dispute over funding for the drug in England's public health system (NHS) was brought to a close at the Supreme Court.
The NHS reported that pre-exposure inhibition treatment (PrEP) is prescribed to about 10,000 people during the first three-year trial; a drug taken before intercourse has been found to reduce the risk of infection by about 86 per cent in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that said the NHS was able to pay for the PrEP drug, even though it claims it should be funded by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, head of the NHS in England, called the decision announced on Thursday a "significant new intervention," and the National AIDS Association described it as "a crucial moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to start accepting enrollments for the experiment, which will expand to other clinics in October.
Pre-exposure inhibition treatment (PrEP) is an HIV drug taken before sexual intercourse, which reduces the risk of infection.
Tests have shown that PrEP will significantly reduce HIV infections in high-risk groups.
A drug taken before sexual intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body during intercourse to prevent HIV infection.
You can take the medicine every day or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people and people with an HIV positive partner who do not receive effective treatment.
Clinicians select applicants who meet the conditions for the experiment from men, women and transgender people, as well as those whose HIV positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and enrolled in general medical care can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost £10m and the NHS in England this week signed a contract for medicines following an international tender.
The experiment is designed to assess the potential of the PrEP drug by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and implementation.
"This major new intervention should complement and enhance the diverse and increasingly effective tools already in place to prevent HIV," says Stevens.
"This is yet another significant achievement in more than 30 years of struggle to solve one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, director of the national AIDS organization.
"If PrEP is properly targeted to those in need and at risk, it can have a transformative effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September, those at risk will receive a drug through a trial funded by the NHS that they can decide to use independently without the need to negotiate with a partner, with an empowering effect that will improve the lives of very many people.
This was welcome news. "
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and no one at risk will be excluded," says Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP drug used in the experiment has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the PrEP trial is a welcome event that dragged on unnecessarily for several months because of the government's slowdown," says Sharon Hodgson, the shadow cabinet health minister.
"We have evidence that the drug can have a transformative effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this menacing disease.
The experiment will help us better understand the real benefits of the PrEP drug.
It is now important for the experiment to be launched as soon as possible across the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and move a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society. "
Quality of life: The intermediate layer and smart interior solutions have turned a small Earl's Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who was keen on renovating properties, moved from a residential area of Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of the Queen Anna era style house. The success of the renovation is illustrated by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed her flyers and moved.
"Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment," Joanne says.
'i'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to the apartment show here and found the rooms were as high as they were in my apartment at the time.
I was immediately fascinated and made an offer on the same day. "
Since then, the approximately 90 square metre apartment has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a duo where the bedroom was only accessible from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space, as well as an intermediate layer, in order to take advantage of the height of the room.
"I wanted space, large windows and lots of light.
They were my demands, "he says.
He hired Erfan Azad for work at the Duck & Shed design office in Notting Hill, which was tasked with taking advantage of the space of nearly four metres tall rooms and creating an apartment that would not just be a renovation and sale destination but a home.
Room height wasn't quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate layer where you could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"The steel structures are quite complex.
The facilities had to be arranged in such a way that there was no need to tear up.
The structures had to be shaped so that the height is just right both on and below them. "
Erfan was able to place the space duplicating two full high rooms with intriguing details.
In the middle floor, a picturesque window of Retrouvius opens into a stylish living space.
Peilicular furniture, silver enhancements and Serge Mouille's vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, the sense of space and light.
The mirrors at either end of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than the real one.
The mirror in the kitchen relay is like a window from which to open a view into another room.
The mirrored furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne's aterim and glass items.
This is compounded by the fact that the kitchen can be hidden when it is not used.
Kitchens equipped with folding doors are not a new solution,
But what's unique about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a little bit of planning," Erfan says of the steel-reinforced cool-surface MDF door.
"It is balanced, which means that it slips very easily when it is raised."
With the sensible use of space and the design of the storage space, Joanne received 16 extra square metres, a second bedroom and a better bottom solution.
"When selling a home, the area counts -- or the valuation of the property," Erfan says.
"Basically, a real estate agent walks in to an apartment and calculates the price based on the surface."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was increased by using high quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The resident is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the tunnel to the apartment is partly based on them," Erfan says.
"No one is drawn to the power lines running through the walls.
They are also important, but not in the same way. "
Joanne's apartment is an example of how good design and supplements can make a basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.

Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited Båstad, Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, during the day, Sofia represented A Sustainable Tomorrow at the seminar in a gorgeous blue thigh-skimming outfit that donned a gorgeous finish to the pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last representative event in which Sofia stands before her birth.
His calculated time is in September.
For dinner at the event, Sofia had opted for a beautiful pastellinsine dress, which landed awkwardly.
The style was crowned with large earrings and an elegant little bag.
Pastellinsine nicely dressed the princess.
Sofia has been on a mission in Båstad, Sweden this week.
Sofia complemented her outfit with a little bag.

He grows us with sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, a chef appeared on Lake Tower selling Thai food.
The lads did not dare to taste, but walked past.
In Koju, food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among acquaintances in Panama.
He did not know much about Finnish, and at that time the Finns did not yet know how to do it.
Because the people didn't dare go to eat, Panja offered free tastes.
This is how he taught the lads to eat thairfood, spring snap at a time.
From countries, "he said.
I missed the lab on the hook.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its thaircane in the Lake District.
It had two small tables, there might be fewer than 20 customer seats.
He taught us not only to eat thairfood, but to sit next to a boat guest.
When you are hungry and places are limited, you can't leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
Little by little, we got to know better and we became friends.
In the end, I sat on the board with a dictionary to learn thaikieli.
Two years went by the side of the shopping hall, but then the restaurant had to change because the self-made spice stalls reportedly applied too much in the hall.
A new venue was released from the end of the trading hall.
There's space there.
Now we jurors are allowed to sit at our own tables again, only in the most crowded times will we be shy to ask guests if there is space next door.
Panja knows his client.
He is told the belongings, where it has taken place and who has been seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He has seen how the life stages of customers vary and the food club changes.
He remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring snakes with.
He remembers me as lazy and fat, and remembers what I was like when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than others, sit in my own place beside the kitchen door and exchange belongings with Panja leaning on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with sweet chili sauce.
In addition to our sense of taste, he has opened up our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many people are talking to him about thai - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Although it has been difficult for him, he is always friendly.
He's hard-working.
On top of the restaurant work, she goes to a mushroom and a blazer.
Last week, the restaurant quietly celebrated the fulfillment of two decades.
We customers got a strawberry cake for dessert.
Without fuss or attention went this momentous day, at work.
Discovery of underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists ready to strike in Europe
At the beginning of the year, security officials got hold of an important list for counter-terrorism work.
The list includes data from more than 170 Isis fighters ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are 173 people, and the document includes not only their personal data, but also pictures of each.
More than 130 of the people mentioned in the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They are from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Ilta-Sanomat reported the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the place to find the list and the information it contains have been specified.
According to the paper, Iraqi army special forces found a list of terrorists' personal information and images while investigating the terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence officials assessed the authenticity of the documents and sent them on to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all security authorities in European countries in May.
In the background was the fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists following the demise of Isis in the Middle East.
According to die Welt, the list includes not only the names and images of all individuals, but also their date of birth, invented aliases, and information about the person's country of origin.
The list also specifies the specific areas of the terrorists.
For example, in the case of the German 27-year-old Sami J., who is on the list, it says Abu Assid al-Almani, or German.
He is said to have left Germany in 2012, travelling first to Egypt, then Libya and later via Turkey to Syria to join the ranks of Isis.
A suicide bomber has been written as a specialist next to his picture.
There is no specific information about the man's fate.
A total of about 6,000 fighters have left Europe for Isis, whose fate is uncertain.
A man lurks beneath the surface in Helsinki's Tokoin beach
Based on interviews with emergency services, the man had wanted to show he could swim.
It is possible to save the life of a drowning person.
On Thursday, a person under water was rescued in Tokoinranta in Helsinki.
Ville Estlander, an emergency firefighter at Helsinki's rescue service, said the situation was over quickly.
The person was found under the water about 15 minutes after the announcement.
A rescue diver found him beneath the surface, Estlander says.
Emergency services were notified after half past four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered into the hands of primary care.
Estlander says it was a man about 50 years old.
Based on the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander commends the authorities' cooperation with the Border Patrol and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Patrol.
Those in attendance also guided divers excellently.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water along with Border Force and police.
Two cars collided in Eura - nine people in cars, three were seriously injured
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered less serious injuries, according to a firefighter.
Both men and women are among the injured.
The accident happened at the intersection of three roads at four in the day.
The crash happened when another car turned from behind a warning triangle in front of another car, according to a firefighter.
According to the emergency services, there is an 80 km / h speed limit at the intersection.
Brothers fight for more than $500 million in real estate assets
Two brothers are in contention for the biggest property empire in Victoria worth more than $500 million, a dispute linked to a family business set up by their Italian family 40 years ago.
Colin De Lutis, a former Carlton Football Club president and real estate developer, lives in the Toorak value area just three houses away from his younger brother, Pauli.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute over the separation.
The brothers and their mother Anna jointly own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, and the family began to accumulate property when they bought a shop in Collingwood's Smith Street in 1973.
The family set up a Westco Jeans shop there, which expanded into a chain of 160 movements.
The store chain sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, property development areas in Brunswick and Sorrelao and apartments in the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and suburban shopping malls.
Under the agreement with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul owns about a third of the company's assets. Paul describes his father as "the carrying power and central figure of the family."
According to court documents, the asset allocation ratio means Colin owns properties worth about $316 million and Paul about $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first false testimony to the court in 2015.
The case was heard last Friday for the first time in the Supreme Court after several attempts at mediation.
The brothers are now also in dispute over who controls the existing business; Paul claims Colin has ruled him out of the business.
Colin says the allegation is untrue; he accuses Paul of poor management of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first false testimonies that he would like to find a solution to the issue.
"In line with our Italian tradition, the family is most important to me," Colin says in a statement.
There are hundreds of pages of false statements, emails and reports, and the case is being investigated by consultancy companies such as Deloit, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian migrants who set up milk bars and delicacy shops in the late 1950s.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin set up the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he set up the shop "in the final years of high school, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often stated that he did not want the brothers to end up in court," she writes in a statement.
The family's two other sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business, with Colin saying Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Pauli, Luke and Mark are "bitter about the financial terms of their departure."
Colin has kept a low profile, despite being a former board member of the Australian Football League club and the best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to this biography in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, telling him in a text message that he couldn't really comment because it was being dealt with in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take me to court and bring our family's name into the legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to agree to his brother's claims.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way," Colin continued, saying he still hoped to find a solution.
On Friday, hope appeared to have gone out.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
In the first place.
According to Poltico, the new White House chief of staff plans to limit President Trumpi's media use and monitoring the news so the boss doesn't get into trouble so often.
Reporter Josh Dawsey reports:
"When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with senior staff on his first day in office, he raised a key problem he's going to solve: He's going to limit President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told White House employees that any information -- whether printed or heard in briefings -- must pass through him because the president makes better decisions when you get good information. "
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has a relationship with television for decades -- and, as president, he still watches a lot of television.
"If presidential candidate Trump was nervous about unfair news coverage, it was worth showing him that sympathetic media handled things more evenly," Sam Nunberg, who worked as an adviser to the Trumpi campaign, told Politico in February.
At the time, Politico reporter Tara Palmer wrote that "according to six former campaign employees, it is essential to manage Trumpi's use of Twitter that his personal media flow includes a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
But it is ridiculous to suggest that Trumpi's use of Twitter has ever been under control.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something the rest of us don't know -- maybe Trump's tweets without their efforts would have been even more cheerful.
We will probably never find out what kind of messages were not sent from Trump.
If his staff have even been able to prevent him from causing problems on a few occasions, their work has not been in vain.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing a stir.
The problem is partly because there are rival factions in the White House trying to push their case by providing Trump with information that supports their view, information that can be reliable -- or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers deliberately give the president questionable information.
Journalist Shane Goldmacher reported on an incident:
'Trumpi's current and former employees say he can be hugely infuriated by press clips criticizing him -- especially if they report damaging data leaks, then he's absolutely forced to know where the information came from.
That was the case in late February when someone jokingly gave the president a copy of the news on GotNews.com., set up by online provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of several leaks of information from the White House.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and had previously spread false accusations and later withdrew them; he also did not provide any concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, after reading the article, Trump had begun asking staff about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that Reince Priebus, the then chief of staff, and Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary, "had tried to introduce a system of management of documents going to Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly is trying the same three months later.
Maybe he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump still has his own impulsive self and his aides continue to push their own issues.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's task very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year deal with PSG
Brazil star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, according to AFP news agency.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, who play football in the Spanish league, an exit price of 222 million euros.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona had therefore been terminated and he was free to move to Paris club PSG.
The huge transfer sum of €222 million is the biggest in football history.
Previously, the record was at Manchester United, who paid €105 million for Frenchman Paul Pogba last summer.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned qatari company.
The club will be chaired by former tennis professional, qatarian Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is believed to be arriving in Paris on Friday.
Performance writer Raija Oranen explained with the hypnosis of alcoholism and fear of flying: "I'm in the shape of my life."
Raija Oranen, a successful writer known for the TV series for the time of rose and clean light floors, just spent her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren keep mum so grip along with writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola apartment after 18 winter.
First they sold their house, but now there was also a rented apartment in the spring.
In light and sun, away from the old circles Raijan was once taken by depression and alcoholism, which he has survived.
The external nature is also 20 kilos lighter.
The weight went on to fall when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were mood drugs.
To alcoholism, I once got help with hypnosis, which also teamed up with fear of flying, I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, the radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for more than 45 years.
I can do better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen, who has worked in the tourism industry, has been together for more than 40 years.
I took revenge, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That's the kind of queen of drama he's always been, ending his life with that one, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who has made a remarkable career as a writer, remembers only a good 44-piece clean light slick TV series that touched and moved the late-time Finland.
I finally decided to have a fresh family firm in the clothing industry when I read the 50th anniversary interview with Liisa Seppänen on the plane.
I was my own daughter, my mother also had a clothing business, and sometimes I was a mannequin, "Oranen recalls.
For him, the plot of the series and the story changed the attitude of Finns to entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and thesis revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen is living as a writer for an active time, she has many manuscripts at work - ideas for hundreds.
Itineraries returned across the ditch to the "flower of millionaires"
House owners, one of the wealthiest in the West Midlands, are back on base with persistent itineraries who managed to cross the ditch dug by the municipality and return to the field adjacent to the houses.
Nomads parked their twenty caravans near a street known as the flower of millionaires in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the conquest excavated by the municipality as a barrier, bringing children, horses and an army of vans.
The nomads managed to cross the trajectory at a point that had been left unprotected because of the path.
Outraged residents have accused the Solihull municipality of "total inability to solve the problem."
An anonymous resident says the tours came from Bentley Heath on Monday night, where they had thrown passers-by with stones.
"The municipality needs to be made to work because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The nomads were here in May, then they went away but returned again.
There were more of them in the evening and probably even more today. "
The resident said that Birmingham municipality had solved the problem by denying access to parks.
"I live in Streetsbrook Road, and it is frustrating to pay local taxes when the municipality cannot do anything about it."
Another anonymous resident said it was ridiculous for the nomads to return so soon after they were driven away.
'There's more of them than before and they've even put a horse grazing in the park. '
According to a spokesman for Solihull municipality, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal steps with Solihull police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
In order to gather evidence, it is very important for as many locals as possible to report disruptive or criminal activity to the police.
It will help to create an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings. "
Enraged people surrounded Portugal's turf machine
The men who made a forced landing on a beach full of people in Portugal have been questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the forced landing.
The two men who flew the plane can be charged with causing death.
At its longest, it can be sentenced to 16 years in prison in Portugal.
Yesterday, a small plane flying by men had to make a forced landing on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon, due to a technical fault.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the incident, some of whom ran a descending plane to escape into the water.
The plane was hit as it landed on a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane first hit the man, who was on the back of the plane.
Immediately after the plane went up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, according to Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias, who was on the beach.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not injured.
Those on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash in anger.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and began smashing its butt, according to Celia Rocha Correio da Manha, who witnessed the incident.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It is a miracle that no more people died.
The two men on board were not injured in the expropriation.
The Finnish star, who tragically lost his leg, won World Cup gold again: "Without an accident, I wouldn't be a world champion."
Early Wednesday morning, Matti Greater Hamari celebrated Finland's time in a World Cup gold banked slalom during a competition in Big White, Canada.
Earlier, Greater Hamari also won the Cross World Cup gold at the Games.
In total, there have already been three World Cup titles.
Pretty incredible World Cup!
Twice treated for gold, with a pretty good pulse pulled, Greater Hamari, reached by phone, was delighted.
The 30-year-old teller thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Greater Hamar, the number of contenders in the sport is growing all the time.
The whole balcony has grown and developed a great deal in recent times.
The differences are getting smaller, and there are a lot of new tellers.
You always wonder whether there will be some black horse from behind.
There seems to be a different winner in every race.
Greater Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been eagerly counting from a young age with his friends, and the accident did not take away the desire to get to the slope.
From time to time, I wonder what my life would be like without that calamity.
But my attitude has always been that there is no need to shy away from it.
Those cards play which are shared, Greater Hamari stresses.
It would be cruel to treat a serious accident and the loss of a limb as a stroke of luck, and Greater Hamari does not do so.
But he turned the gruesome difficulty to his advantage.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned into a victory.
I wouldn't be a triple world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Greater Hamar's biggest board effort was already fading.
It was only after the accident that the boom towards the top started in earnest.
I was training at a young age with friends, and we were always looking forward to X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that soured somewhat over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself there at the start of the X-Games.
I could not have imagined beforehand.
I was 23 years old and I thought this was going to be a very long life if I stay here to be bitten and mourned.
I decided to pull the skirts in the neck and start working.
I would say I've been pretty successful.
The laser was very pleased with the choice of wheelchair player Leo-Pekka star as athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic champion received his award at a sports gala in January.
According to Greater Hamar, the star's victory is an important signal to the para-sports crowd.
It was a really big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
This will certainly also open eyes to the world of para-sports.
When is it time to launch a sportswear campaign of the year for the double world champion Matti Greater Hamar?
It will then be seen in due course.
I try to do my best to succeed.
Still, Greater Hamari hasn't conquered all the peaks they crave.
Next year there will be a big goal.
After a year, the Paralympic Games will take place in South Korea.
Yes, you go out there and get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugee youth do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees frying bread at a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of young people in Syria do not believe that they will return to their home country permanently.
They said the end of the war in Syria and the departure of Isis are the most important things that should happen in order for them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seen as bringing change to the Syrian conflict.
Burson-Marsteller, the communications agency chain, explained the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international study.
Burson-Marsteller has spent nine years studying the opinions and attitudes of the Arabs.
This year, A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Between February and March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youths aged between 18 and 24 responded to the survey, half of them women and half men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their home country permanently in the future.
Forty-two per cent of respondents can think of returning to their home countries and four per cent couldn't say.
The study found that young people's decision to return home is most affected by the ongoing war in Syria, as well as the presence of Isis in the country.
Almost half (47%) see the end of the war as the most contributing factor to permanent homecoming, while a quarter think the most important thing would be for Isis to leave the country.
Just under a tenth elevate the improvement of the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria as the main factors influencing the decision.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict
Young people in Syria were asked what is the most important factor in ending the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more essential than the removal of President Bashar al-Assad from power.
Just over a quarter see al-Assad's presidency as an obstacle to a peace deal.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing conflict in Syria.
No more than a quarter believe in resolving the conflict through military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugee youth see Isis's power weakened over the past year, while a fifth feel its power has been strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is for the media to pass on information to people that Isis has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many people made military measures, as well as education reform, a priority.
For just over a tenth, the most important thing would be to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the Trump-administration's impact on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe the conflict will not change under the Trump-era.
Nearly one in four believe the conflict in Syria is getting worse in the Trump-era.
Opinions are divided as to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding to keep the internet in order - the database he developed is used by, for example, Wikipedia and Google
Espool-based firm MariaDB is developing the "world's fastest growing" open-source database.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by dog entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs users absolutely nothing and can be developed through the web by any eminent programmer.
Google and Wikipedia, for example, are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge amounts of data are kept in order and quickly available.
If you use LinkedIn, Twitter or Booking.com, for example, they will take advantage of the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in picture form comes from the database, and even the images are linked to it," explains Widenius.
Widenius, a technology director at MariaDB, spends about half his time coding.
The man, who works remotely from the street, is helping to ensure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open-source database, MySQL, along with Swede David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later, software giant Oracle greeted the Sun for $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle-deal took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, which did not give a definite promise for the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already set up a company at this stage, which started developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life work to die.
I hired twenty of the best developers from the Sun, thus ensuring the continuity of the code was secured with the help of the same guys who created it.
As MySQL is an open-source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch of it.
The name just had to be changed.
A foundation was set up to oversee the development of the MariaDB code.
"Under MySQL, these assurances were not made," Widenius laments.
While many people have heard of Widenius and MySQL billions, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"In recent years, our growth rate has been about 50 per cent a year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, MariaDB's chief financial officer.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is yet to make a profit, and Paqvalé is scant on the company's figures.
To that extent, he reveals that in the current financial year, MariaDB estimates it will receive €20 million worth of orders.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it that corporate customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps change databases, which can be more than a year of work if a customer has used a closed database.
From MySQL, switching to MariaDB succeeds instantly because they are versions of each other.
Spanish operator Telefónica and South East Asia's biggest bank, DBS, among others, are customers paying for MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaba's Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB spreads to new users automatically in delivery packages for Linux operating systems, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small company, we have links to the biggest cowards.
"Our customers include the world's largest telecoms operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central bank," Paqvalé lists.
The computer market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP in their closed databases.
Oraclellek's MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
While, according to research firm Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, players like MariaDB, in terms of turnover, are still negligible, if fast-growing, sinks.
In the roughly $50 billion database market, open-source databases do not even reach a billion.
However, the value of open source cannot be measured only in money, because most users do not pay anything for these software.
Research firm Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies are already developing more than 70 percent of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would then have been switched to open or at least started to move.
Big companies will not get new customers because most will next choose open source.
This has resulted in licence fees for commercial databases jumping into the clouds.
The companies want to make as much money as they did in the past with a smaller number of customers, "Widenius reflects.
Because it is difficult to change a closed database, the majority of customer companies have been obedient to the price increases.
"There are a lot of customers for whom it's really difficult to move because their old apps and others are caught in a closed database," says Widenius.
He still believes the measure of customers is getting full.
When licence fees rise every year, the customer will sooner or later move to an open source database.
The price is between 10% and 20%, and the service is better because you can easily switch to another database if you want.
Moreover, many companies are already facing major systemic changes as they move their operations to cloud computing.
At the same time, many people change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million in loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has about 115 employees worldwide and is now set to hire more.
One of the reasons for the EIB funding was the impact of MariaDB on public procurement.
The company has public sector clients in countries such as Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros a year for databases.
"Many countries want to switch to open-source solutions, thus using tax money more efficiently," says Paqvalén.
Widenius is annoyed that money is being wasted on, say, closed healthcare systems in Finland when open systems are cheaper, and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say open source code is an ideology, but I think it's a better way to do code.
The community helps and does something that is not invented or able to do.
The 55-year-old Widenius, along with another Finn, Linus Torvalds, a Linux developer, is one of the best-known proponents of open source.
Widenius helps other companies to develop viable business models on top of open source.
I still have four to five speeches a year around the world on this issue.
Italy toughens its stance on NGO rescue ships
Italy has warned NGOs that rescue refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue unless they commit to complying with the new rules governing their activities.
"If the NGOs don't commit to a new code of conduct, it's hard to see how they could continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Tower newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities had seized the ship of a German Jugend Rettet relief organization, whose crew is suspected of working with human smugglers to promote illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has been operating for only a year, declined to comment on the detailed charges of prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization announced in a statement posted on social media.
"We will only be able to assess the allegations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa platform of Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected of taking boat refugees on board directly from human smugglers who regained access to the boats.
One such incident is alleged to have occurred just a few miles off the coast of Libya, according to the prosecutor's document, the contents of which have been published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area, motivated by the enthusiasm for help.
According to the code of conduct, vessels such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer overseeing the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue efforts have so far agreed to comply with the code of conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
Which announced Thursday that it considers the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they do not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the organisation's rescue operations.
Among those who refused to comply with the code of conduct is the Nobel Prize-winning Médecins sans Frontières.
Minniti, meanwhile, said that with the rescue efforts, the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which he sees as evidence that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and work with local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
"The last few days have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed plans to continue talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development projects, as well as with Chad, Niger and Mali, on measures to reduce the number of refugees heading towards Europe.
Local worker suspected of killing his unmarried partner in Enontekiö, suspect found in terrain - case for prosecutor
The alleged crime took place in Enontekiö Kuttas last December.
Police say a 36-year-old man from the Czech Republic is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish unmarried partner.
It has previously been reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police have also said that the suspect had fled to the ground with two dogs after his actions.
The man was found soaked in the terrain and made no resistance when captured.
The charge in the case must be brought within less than a week.
The case may still be filed in Lapland District Court in August.
Robert Hardy, who is known for Harry Potter and all of my bitter friends, has died
British actor Robert Hardy has died aged 91.
The actor's death was announced Thursday by his family.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting corner at the age of 24 in the theater.
During his long career, he also performed in movies and television.
Hardy will be particularly remembered for the role of magician Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter movies, as well as for his veterinary role in an all-bitter television series based on James Herriot's book.
The BBC's popular series was filmed for a total of seven seasons.
Michelle Carter sentenced to prison for text messages inciting suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for text messages and phone calls to incite her boyfriend Conrad Roy to suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months of his sentence in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of manslaughter; her boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said during Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter filed an appeal against the conviction and was allowed to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was facing a 20-year sentence, but his lawyers said both Carter and Roy suffered mental health problems.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured bag, Carter listened to his sentence with his hands crossed with a weird look set on the ground.
"Conrad Roy was killed by his actions," the prosecutor told the court.
"He ended Conrad's life in order to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act, "the prosecutor continued.
"He has shown no remorse."
Carter's lawyer said the incident was the result of "shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said Carter's "age or maturity level and even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions."
The prosecutor read a statement from Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, telling her that "not a day goes by that I don't mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I cope with all this. I will try my best to comfort her sister in this pain that we will always carry. "
Conrad's sister, Camdyn Roy, told the court she was "persecuted" by the idea that she would never see her brother's wedding and not be an aunt to her children.
"It is painful to lose a person who has been in my life every day since I was born.
The case appears to be setting a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that inciting suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in a car for caged poisoning in 2014.
The case drew national attention when it emerged that Carter had incited her boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"Hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent to Roye during the two weeks before his death.
Just before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to launch a generator, and you are free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention in Roy's death, a judge ordered that Carter should not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of experts.
Few have defended Carter; one of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering her British bad guy in Italy in 2007 and was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published an opinion piece for Knox, saying: "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary General: Relations with Russia the worst since the Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated markedly, commented NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is more difficult now than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, "Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO remains committed to working to ensure that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid escalation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump was able to say that relations between the US and Russia had even reached dangerously bad levels.
Trump called to thank the countries for their poor relations with Congress, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Audi makes changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to backlash experienced by automakers
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to update the software for more than 350,000 cars.
The head of BMW said the company believes that "there are more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions," referring to European cities, including BMW's home town of Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it was making changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies talked about the call back.
European car manufacturers have been heavily marketing the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to meet CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are thought to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing equipment that neutralises emissions will rise, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German carmakers are under intense scrutiny, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of conspiring with major car companies and ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which installed cheating devices in cars that reduced emissions to comply with the regulations in the tests.
Several Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States, but their actions are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics in Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the US for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen; authorities doubted that Audi had installed a system in its cars to circumvent European emissions standards, an accusation based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi's investigation could significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: The luxury car maker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
Venezuela vote began with a flashback, big demonstrations to come
The company said the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities is at least a million more than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a firm that has no role in the outcome of the election, National Electoral Commission President Tibisay Lucenan said to reporters.
Maduro assures the crisis will end
In a controversial vote in Venezuela on Sunday, an assembly was elected to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticized the vote and organised demonstrations against changing it.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be running at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais, the country's national security forces began to take control of the country's parliament building on Wednesday evening local time.
The force is supposed to ensure the safety of the nomination ceremony.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Laventel has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender had been reduced due to drought and insects that carry diseases, and scientists and farmers are feverishly trying to find a solution to the problem.
"The lavender is downright endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years.
"This will shorten the life of the lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought a lot of small cascades to the region, spreading microbacteria. "
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and is also a highly sought-after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of crying stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are underdeveloped or weakened or missing altogether," says Chaisse.
"In other words, there are fewer and fewer parts containing effluent oil."
The solution is sought by intensifying irrigation, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture and injecting plants with a protective mix of clay and water.
Journalist's murder embodies growing threat in Mexico
The delivery of the Riodoce newspaper, which appears once a week, usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the magazine deals with the most recent cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and the never-ending drug war in Sinaloa state.
Today, however, there is a debate about security in the light of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: Leave the children at home or include them in the delivery, which was hit by a mortar attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the lid board at the front of the room: Opponents, neutral, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group. No evidence is needed, the findings and sensations are sufficient.
The board writes the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or drug cartels, criminals who make reporting on Mexican chaos life-threatening.
According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012.
The latest victims include Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, a journalist and a source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed, even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered by a huge picture of Valdez showing the middle finger. The picture reads: "Justice."
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez's death, with journalists discussing their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and fears that have become paranoid.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was created specifically to deal with journalists "cases, but the Committee for the Protection of Journalists says only two charges have been filed so far.
The killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice, just as few of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year end up in court.
Riodoce journalists plan to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even if they are broken by grief and the situation is even more dangerous.
Ibarra said the security meeting is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the cause of the incident."
Valdez had left the delivery of Riodoce in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of May 15, 2017.
He had only driven a couple of blocks to his red Toyotal when he was stopped by two men and forced out of his car and fired twelve shots, presumably linked to the newspaper's name: Riodoce means the twelfth river.
The shooter drove away with Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left saddened by a wife and two adult children.
Rumours are moving quickly and circulating freely in Culiacan.
However, there is a whirlwind of Valdez's death.
Sinaloa has been one of Mexico's bloodiest battlefields since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
On the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot dead every day, and the cemetery has decorative two-storey burial buildings of drug barons, larger than the houses of many.
In a state on the coast, it is' calm 'when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his job, the founder and director of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez, feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two errors led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who runs a rival faction that is waging war against Guzman's sons.
The case could upset Guzman's sons: Customers suspected of being gang members bought every number in the magazine as soon as the magazine came to outlets.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same article was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when, in 2003, he decided to set up a Riodoce with five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without addressing the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to be known for its bold and honest stuff, and its sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-class investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by articles in the newspaper that no one else dared publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for his reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage to follow the story of Mexico's drug trafficking relentlessly.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said, receiving an award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a "way of life," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"A journalist has to take on the task that falls to him -- or play stupid.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was sown here -- why didn't I tell you what was going on? "
They miss a friend who was always given a hug and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to cope.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He went to the editorial opposite El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they are asking whether the routines were to his fate.
A colleague's death has also led them to consider how best to do their job and stay alive.
"Criminals don't like it if we deal with their women and children in our cases and their clean business, their secret drug trafficking runways.
They were left out of the story, "Bojorquez says.
It meant, at best, strong self-censorship and self-protection,
Trusting your own instincts.
If you feel like everything is not right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Riodoce journalist Andres Villarreal, is that "the impression can fail, and that was the case with Javier."
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply to Tamaulipasi, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: Attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce's security training was held; a few days earlier it had emerged that only spyware sold to governments had followed activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter in the shade of a tree from a 40 degree heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce offices located in a four-storey building in the middle-class Culiacan district.
Some journalists guessed, half-joking, whether it was the two police officers who were among the 50 percent that the state governor didn't consider reliable.
It had been months since reporters had visited the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, Riodoce's delivery envisaged three main stuff.
The brother of novelist Julio Cesar Chavez had been killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that government spending was focused on the governor's home town.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just blocks from the prosecutor's office, had been kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to tread carefully: Everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out in public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (Pri), which has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for nearly a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in highly publicized cases.
In one of them, the son of 'El Chapo' Guzman managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known they were getting reliable information about the kidnapping from Valdez's column.
"In the past, we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has received the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body structure.
"Now all links with our sources of information are broken."
Valdez's office has been turned into a warehouse holding signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists, who have been given a new, unexpected task: They have become activists for press freedom.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with him as he left for a demonstration in front of the local prosecutor's office the next morning, caused by yet another murder of a journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in western Michoacan state three days after the murder of Valdez.
A burned body was found after the disappearance, which based on DNA tests carried out by the authorities is Adame.
Journalists have started to protest more loudly throughout the country, with "SOS Press" texts appearing on pavements and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to garner international support for the investigation into the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused authorities of spying and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked to be moved out of the cases dealing with the government amid concerns that he will not be able to be objectified.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that, in Mexico, journalists are surrounded by organised crime, criminal authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narkojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed on the orders of politicians and security forces, in agreement with organised crime.
The Articulo 19 monitoring group said more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by police and authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," says Ramirez.
Murder has a crippling effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipasi six years ago.
His body was accompanied by a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I am here because of my writing."
Next to his severed head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to close, such as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the March murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredo, El Manana, although its leader was assassinated in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to drug cartels on its front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or the entire country.
It is a difficult decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and you have to be on guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals look into a journalist's hands, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra -- who was once supposed to become a poet -- admits that writing about the drug trade is frightening.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Not long ago, Riodoce reporters sat at midnight on Friday in front of a delivery with a footy beer once the magazine's latest number had been completed. Suddenly, their phones began to colour to mark the message.
Nineteen people had been killed in the shooting between rival gangs and security forces at the beach resort of Mazatlan.
The war escalated, as promised in the cartel messages found in the region.
Reporters put the news on Riodoce's website from the footpath on their smartphones.
The front page had to be put up again the next day.
The Sireens extended nearby -- yet another shooting scene.
Bojorquez took a look at the police officers guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's delivery continued the tradition of the magazine's murdered founder under this massive portrait of a man showing the middle finger throughout Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider quitting. "How could I close the magazine when our trainee asked to get on the street to do a story on the same day that Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge setback - "Kova place"
The celebrations of Hannu Manninen, who was 39 in April, fell short, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training season began in a catastrophic manner when Manninen fell ill with the flu.
That was the start of a long period of ill health that dragged on for nearly five weeks.
Mrs May went virtually completely when she fell ill.
First there was the flu and finally a child's disease such as ear inflammation, which I had to eat an antibiotic fever.
I was only able to do ten per cent of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been around for a long time.
It was a tough place when I wasn't able to take advantage of the internship, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanom.
Test results plummeted
The 2007 world champion did not get a traineeship permit until the second week of June, which was reflected in a rolled carpet test by KIHU, a racing and top sports research centre on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skips on rolls on the carpet, whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes the athlete's fingerprint on a needle with a lactic acid sample.
Last autumn I was on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed for 28 minutes.
Came up against the wall, Manninen says.
For the better
After initial difficulties, Manninen says he stayed healthy.
I've done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises in an effort to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now we have a really good five-week period behind us.
There was also a week and a half of vacation from a flying job.
I have time with my family to visit the cottage as well.
Last season, Manninen took part in just four World Cup races before the World Cup in Lahti.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening competition as Manninen rose to 18th at the top.
Guidelines pulled
Manninen and national team head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm in training compared to last season.
After the first snow Games, Ruka would have a weekend of three World Cup games.
In December, the intention would be to be involved in at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsay.
In late January, there would be plans to still be involved in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, the name can be found on the Olympic team's list, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would already be the sixth Winter Olympics of a career for Manning.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, the nummelian, who celebrated gold in the team competition in Salt Lake City in 2002, alleges.
Dinosaur sheltered from its enemies by masking
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now, scientists have revealed the first results of research into a scale-sized creature found by a Canadian miner, which was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had been so well preserved that the researchers were even able to determine that its Finnish skin was red and had had a "problematic past."
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armoured dinosaur of all time and one of the best of its kind in the world.
The newly discovered fossil is nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the pasture period 110 to 112 million years ago.
Scientists see this amazingly well-preserved fossil as a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic, the armoured vegetarian is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever.
It was found at the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely at his discovery.
A fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
There, the beast was dug up for six years from a block of 1,100 kilograms.
We can now see the results of the hard work.
"If you clean your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says Caleb Brown, a science writer who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrell.
"It will go down in the history of science as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Leather studies found that dinosaurs eating meat were likely to pose a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had an armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor masquerading it from predators, and was also shielded off by darker and lighter coloring, which still occurs in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to blend into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
Scientists have named it Borealope markmitchelli, according to museum technician Mark Mitchell, who was part of a team that took more than 7,000 hours to dig up a dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body wolves and armor.
They found that it was still protected by general coloring in the animal world, where the body is darker and lighter.
The finding was still a surprise because Borealopesta is significantly larger than the current animals with similar colouring.
It suggests that the dinosaurs eating meat caught it to such an extent that evolution favoured hiding as a means of survival rather than struggle.
They are much smaller and therefore easier to catch, which suggests that nodosaurus, too, was under serious threat.
"The prey of a large, heavily armoured dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the fattening period were," says Brown.
A chemical analysis of the Finnish organic compounds of Nodosaurus reveals that its leather was red.
Scientists continue to study nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, including the contents of its bowel to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Investigators believe it fell into the river when it died and drifted into the sea where it sank wide on the seabed.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is today in Florida, and rivers and seas were likely to extend much further than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is really significant because its Finnish leather has been preserved and it has also been preserved three-dimensional in its original form."
"That's why it looks almost the same as it did in the early season
It doesn't take much imagination to outline it: If you sneak a little eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping. "
It was an era of teropods, huge two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs.
While their king, the Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before Borealopelta, its powerful predecessors may have caught this armoured dinosaur.
Tyrannosaurus rex's predecessors included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, a six-year-old monster about 11.5 feet long.
The latest findings by Nodosaurus researchers have been published in the journal Current Biology, who believe Borealope was washed into the sea after her death and mummified in mud.
It was found at the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, with its leather and armor from the rubble to the hip.
Nodosaurs averaged five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
Two half-hearted stunts were elevated from their lads.
Scientists believe this armoured vegetarian passed through current Western Canada until a flooded river carried it into the open sea.
Its armor has been preserved down to small details in an underwater grave.
Its fossilised remains have been preserved so well that its leather is still left in the bumpy plates of armor along its skull.
Indeed, Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such preservation is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The closer you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
The bumpy plates of its skull trap still contain fossilized leather.
Its right front leg is on its side, five from the thigh upwards.
I am also able to calculate the scales of its foot base. "
How one activist learned to answer the question: Who do the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
She had arrived a day earlier in New York from her home in St. Louis and sat on the bed of her airbnb apartment browsing Facebook on her phone.
That's when she noticed a message from her high school friend:
"The young man, who was just 18 years old, was killed by the police and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noted that no one else had posted the same information to his feed, which is why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous rendezvous from user @ TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to a wrestler in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who had been shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
That user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is unbelievable," Ferrell said.
But death was nothing new for him and his community.
He put his phone away and when he returned to Twitter later that evening, it was reported that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted images of police cordons and shouting people, as well as a man claiming to be Brown's father, with a sign bearing it read: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed up with real-time video footage of police standing in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He says he also saw a video in which another police officer injected his rifle and shouted, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," she remembers saying.
"It was not the kind of murder that we are already used to and that could be described as typical.
That's when I felt cold colors.
I was angry and cried. "
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at eleven in the evening. Ferrell went to search for her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferreira and Ferguson over the next nearly three years has been the subject of a documentary film, "Whose Streets?," which premiered in cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, and strength and resilience from the perspective of the local people who took to the streets to demand answers.
As Ferreira drove towards Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a floral dress and matching crown, they revisited the conversation about "what it's like to live in black and under what conditions."
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" She remembers saying to her daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because an 18-year-old boy was killed by the police, and that's not right."
"I couldn't help but take my daughter with me," Ferrell told me later.
"Today's events are... the culmination of the events of the past.
My daughter has a right to know it and grow into it.
He needs to be prepared for activism and organization, but he also needs to know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living in black, and he needs to know what we need to do to liberate, to free ourselves.
Although, thankfully, I have been able to protect her from blatant racism, she is still similar to other black girls.
I feel like I would hurt her if I protected her from reality. "
Their first stop place in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, opposite the police station, which became a camp for activists as they waited for information about the handling of the case and eventually learned that no charges would be filed against the police.
From there, Ferrell and her daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was president of an organization of nurse students belonging to minorities.
"I had no experience of organizing.
Somehow it just happened. "
Weeks later, Ferreira met Sabaah Folayan, deputy director of the documentary, at an evening protest.
Folayan said he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "simply wanted to tell" what was going on.
He asked: "Do you really want to tell us what is going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
The suspicion was driven by the countless times that people had turned up in the local community, usually whites, who simply wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those who were born and grew up in Ferguson had no common voice," Folayan told me recently in an interview. "We wanted to do things differently. "
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism with prisoners on death row.
The involvement of Mr Davis led Mr Ferreira to go along with the project, along with six other locals.
"This is not a documentary in which someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak," Davis says.
"The most important thing for me was how local people are portrayed in the film, because I am presented in the same way. "
Folayan said the intention was not to focus on Ferreira's experience because of the desire to show that the popular movement "is not a charismatic leader but a community."
That's why the documentary sees surprisingly private aspects of Ferreira's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs as he tells me how it felt to see the movie for the first time.
"But I understood that this work and the human portrayal of black people require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferreira's story times and again brings into focus the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement emerged on social media (# BlackLivesMatter) after police shot black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, two of the three founders of the movement identify with queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going," says Ferrell. "It's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure it all. "
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed maintained by black women, including many queer women."
However, he stresses that Ferreira was not selected for the documentary 'self-consciously' because of his queer identity.
"He's got the energy going," Folayan says.
'it's no coincidence, though, that she was on the front line. Black queer women live at the cutting point of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the white canvas. "
News photography groups have left Ferguson long ago, but relations between the community and the police remain strained.
Ferreira still has two and a half years remaining on parole and was convicted of blocking the motorway at the demonstration.
His description of the social political climate in his hometown is short and succinct: "A mess."
Yet he continues to rely on a slogan he learned from outside on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains. "
Fitting unity: Artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York has been hung in the middle of an exhibition space with faces -- white, black and brown, between which you can discern a sense of unity.
The 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's post and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where he served his 35-year sentence, convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to the WikiLeaks website.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on August 2, 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning, whose work combines technology, information technology and art.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA in an algorithmic way and created 30 portraits based on his gene data, a sharp, if somewhat theoretical, statement on the malleability of DNA data, ambiguity and the causal relationships behind interpretations, and identity.
Chelsea Manning, the birth name Bradley Edward, has openly said she has identified with women since puberty and was found guilty in 2013 of 20 offences including espionage law violation, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one photo of Manning being sentenced to prison: A rocky, black and white selfie in which Manning, who was bothered, sits in a car in the driver's seat; he has a platinum pinch in his head that became his hallmark.
Dewey-Hagborg had a stranger Vision project behind him in 2015, which he carried out in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data, obtained DNA data on, for example, tobacco darts and chewing gum, and created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their story," Dewey-Hagborg told a briefing on the new show.
Mr Manning was unable to visit and could not be photographed in prison, so the newspaper contacted Chelsea and asked if he would be interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned others suddenly became correspondents, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even made together a suppressed Images cartoon book, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, depicting a future in which the president would have eased Chelsea's sentence and he would get to see the exhibition.
In reality, Obama commuted Manning's sentence just a few days after the publication of the cartoonist book, a lucky coincidence after seven tough years in a nationwide military prison.
It's also impressive that the exhibition is opening right now that Donald Trump is waging his own war against information leavers and transgender soldiers, coming up with more and more ways on Twitter to amplify the powerful divisions he was actually supposed to alleviate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has a purpose."
In a statement, the artist calls for an end to the "automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture have been based."
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA section: A long queue of C, G and A letters written with a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters -- or nukleotid, like the scientific definition used by the artist -- Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least in our biology.
"I hope that my show will help people to understand that we are equal to our genetic heritage and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretation," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"DNA tells countless stories, 30 of which are on display here."
The show's final work is in its own room: A page from a cartoon book by Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
In it, Manning's character emerges from prison as King Kong, a megaphone in his hand.
"If they can get you silenced, they have won," the photo reads.
"Don't be silent ever."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," says the artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold colors."
Contrary to what was described in the cartoon book, Manning has yet to see the exhibition; when Manning comes in, he will be greeted by a face based on his own genetic information like a crowd of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It's intentional, like everything else in this show: Manning's DNA section, for example, is written with a pencil at a height equal to his length (157.5 cm).
"The face used to be on the wall, but I wanted to bring in a crowd of people to feel," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to describe the mass movement created by Chelsea, which was also behind his release."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee are being sought on suspicion of murder
Police say they have launched a nationwide search to find a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a chicagolic luxury apartment.
The Cook District Court documents show that arrest warrants were issued Monday for Wyndham Lathemi, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, who are suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, who have been issued for first-degree murder without the possibility of being released on bail.
According to the documents, Mr Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
According to a local report released by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on July 27, 2017.
Police cordoned off at the Grand Plaza apartment building found the victim with multiple shrapnel wounds on his body.
Authorities say Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as murder and police are actively searching for two suspects.
She has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president for social relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been barred from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is a criminal case that authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
An emailed statement from the university and Somerville College spokesman said: "We have been in contact with the police in Great Britain and are ready to assist the authorities investigating the case in the United States in any way possible."
In addition, the statement said that Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope that he will surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, the Chicago Police Department's chief information officer, said he was seriously urging suspects to surrender to authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and we are constantly improving our searches," Guglielmi said.
Guglielm said local, regional and national authorities are helping in the search for the suspects.
He said police had received a call from the host of the Grand Plaza building, which had received a vague hint that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
Police described the sight at the scene as horrific.
Guglielm said it was unclear whether the victim had been murdered that day or earlier.
He said security footage revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi says.
Grand Plaza's management team released the following statement to residents: "Police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
Man threatened to blow up Islamic bookshop and 'kill Muslims' in London
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," the convict said to police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced for his threats to blow up an Islamic bookshop in London and "kill all Muslims."
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of aggravated harassment, among other things.
Police said they were alerted by bookshop staff on May 23.
Staff said the man had "threatened to blow up a bookshop and kill Muslims."
The suspect left the store after threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called police about the threats.
The threats were not related to events in the bookshop.
Authorities found Moffatt was wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore's events, a police spokesman said.
I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic, "Moffatt said to police during questioning.
As punishment, a man must carry out 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay legal costs of £620, or about €690, and compensation of £85, or about €95, for victims.
According to a spokesman for Scotland Yard, a number of hate crimes are not reported.
"We will complete the work under the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said Russia will soon complete operations under the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) road map to restore the powers of RUSADA, the Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
"Some of the measures under the road map have already been implemented and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with UKAD, the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for the restoration of RUSADA's powers.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything of concern to Russia.
"Everything has been announced, and everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future. "
However, one of the points on the road map requires Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the findings of an investigation ordered by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who is investigating the state's alleged involvement in doping in Russian sport.
To that, Mutko said: "An investigation is under way because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All the measures have been taken.
There were no state programs, and we can't admit something that didn't exist. '
Mutko's words had echoes of the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, the president of Russia's independent public anti-doping commission.
Earlier that day, Smirnov, speaking to Russian RSporting Sport, acknowledged that there had been problems with Russian anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally, "he added.
The WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015, after the extent of the doping scandal was revealed.
But last June, it received permission to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, the head of WADA, Olivier Niggli, visited the headquarters of the RUSADA in Moscow.
British organisation skeptical of Finnish loved innovation: There is' no evidence 'of health benefits of maternity packaging
A British organisation has doubts about the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packaging.
The BBC and the Guardian, among others, report that the lulling aby Trust, which fights hidden deaths, bans the use of its own brochures on maternity packages distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, too, the packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to Mrs lulling, there is no evidence to suggest that maternal packaging reduces the risk of concealment.
Crunch death marks the unexplained sudden death of a baby.
The lulling Trust is an expert at the British health authorities in the safe sleep of a child.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed into them because that would suggest that we recommend this product, "the organization reported.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, only two deaths per 1,000 births.
According to the lulling Trust, the good reading in Finland is the result of a variety of reasons, such as the small number of teenage pregnancies.
Being there to give every family a box might be one factor.
But you can't say that for sure, "said Francine Bates, chief executive of the lulling Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packages are being marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and hidden deaths.
It is a Finnish invention and has been given free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The pack includes a variety of items such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 items on the packaging.
The pack itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to sleep.
The Scottish Government said the boxes it distributed meet all safety standards.
For its part, the lulling aby Trust says there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a sleeping place.
According to the lulling Trust, packaging can be the best option for a sleeping place if there is no body or topography.
The organization recommends using the packaging only for daytime and stop using it when the child is able to convert.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the pack and making sure it doesn't get wet or dirty.
Vikkelä villain escaped for a second time from a Japanese zoo
Staff at a Japanese zoo are searching for the escaped tortoise.
The blast turtle has surprised staff with its speed and has run out for the second time in two weeks.
The tortoise escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security officers revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, "said Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is female, 55 kilograms and about a metre long.
Yamane describes the carnage as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the villain is allowed to travel freely in the Tarha area.
The zoo has not received eyewitness observations of the turtle.
Konna's previous carnage occurred the week before.
Yamane found the caravan walking along the road 150 metres from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It is able to walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your company avoid Uber's mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce startup company, but the polls didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
While he affirmed that the polls are anonymous, some workers were suspicious of them.
"The polls were simply not consistent or objective," says Errett. Madison Reed, her hair care company, focuses on online shopping.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
A growing number of new personnel management start-ups have entered the market to help other companies figure out how their employees can.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement. Companies can conduct surveys and target specific teams and population groups, as well as provide anonymous reporting services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with senior management over the board.
"You can follow your own health with apps such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company Fitbit?" Asks Jim Barnett, founder and chief executive of Glint startup in Redwood City. Glint provides analytics software for companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years. He says he has gained a more profound insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program can make quick enquiries and votes for certain teams, and it can draw up a map to see at a glance which departments have the most discontent and which managers have received the weakest estimates.
Companies have realised they need to follow a workplace culture so they don't become the next Uber. There has been a buzz around the transportation company since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture of harassing workers and punishing those who talk about problems.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and conformity are a global industry whose value can reach more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to Let's Talk Payments website.
The Conversation, based in Denver, Colorado state, is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behavior.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently struck a deal with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct customized surveys, collect responses confidentially in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by SMS.
And if a director is to be suspected of wrongdoing, the complaints go directly to the company's board of directors.
"The authorities have been sidelined by public opinion," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and chief executive of Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly, even if the authorities do not intervene.
The ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations; the company has been using Convercent for more than a year because it wants to make sure employees are aware of the operating principles and procedures and can easily connect to the headquarters.
In the past, the practice was that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he first had to figure out a phone number or email address to make an announcement to the headquarters, then he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a scary and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, director of law at ruby Tuesday.
In the past, the problems remained hidden from managers working in another city or state; now, problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I will provide a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the reality of the employee," says Vitrano, who runs ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"By doing so, we will protect our shareholders from industrial litigation."
Quinlan said companies began taking ethics, values and employee engagement even more seriously after accountancy firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical activity in connection with the Enron scandal.
It was only with the advent of social media that companies realised they could no longer stand in the way of a public inquiry into their dirt sales.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under the control of ethics," says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged to use.
It is a business model and opportunity accepted by venture capitalists. Both Glint and Convercent are backed by venture capitalists.
In February, Convergent raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and tola Capital, which has raised a total of $47 million in capital.
Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
The investment comes as no surprise, given the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, workers expect more from their jobs.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and give their time to a company that is genuinely useful.
"Employees are more committed to the success of the company if they thrive in the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, head of LinkedInc, which is responsible for the remuneration and wellbeing of employees.
Investors get a return when companies thrive. Companies thrive when employees sign up.
Third party analytics tools promise to boost employee engagement, so it's no wonder they are of interest to investors.
According to experts in workplace culture, information about employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if no action is taken on the basis of it.
If a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if change doesn't come fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand conversations," says Russell Raath, chief executive of Kotter International, a business management consultancy, which has seen companies rely too much on just collecting data.
"If the company does not take action, workers will start to wonder whether they will be heard
And whether their opinions matter at all.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company? "
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently conducting staff surveys on a monthly basis and will be able to tackle the problem on the same day it is announced in Glint.
After gathering feedback from employees frustrated with the slow pace of decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to make changes to teams and provide communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its workers better and hopes a deeper understanding will help it improve the long-term sustainability of staff in an industry known for its high turnover of workers.
"If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it will also lose customers.
And without customers there are no companies. "
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of smuggling his naked female neighbor, according to news agency TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come away from the shower at her home when she noticed a mobile phone hanging at the end of a bitch outside her window.
According to the woman, a mobile phone camera described the apartment.
The woman, who was alarmed by the incident, had run into another room to dress.
After the woman had arrived to check the situation, the mobile phone had been pulled up first but counted shortly afterwards in the window again.
A 20-year-old man suspected of stalking has admitted filming a woman.
However, he claimed he only described the woman's face.
The video, filmed on a mobile phone, had been removed and police had failed to return it as evidence.
During questioning, the man has admitted the act but denied committing the crime.
After filming, the man had justified by saying he loves his neighbor "absolutely crazy."
According to news agency TT, the man will be charged over the incident.
Teachers call for more flair in autumn talks
Wage growth cannot be lower than the export industry, for example, but the gap should be narrowed, said OAJ President Olli Luke on Thursday.
A temporary cut in public sector holiday pay highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to enter into agreements which, in some way, do not include holiday cuts.
It is only when private sector papers have been signed and the rate of increase is clear that agreements will be reached in the sector.
Luke predicts that the working conditions of the OAJ, for example, have been agreed in January.
Procent targets Luke did not yet reveal.
Luke is also chairman of Juko, a public sector trained negotiating organization.
Luke: Lomarahalecut increases earnings development differences
According to the OAJ, statistics and projections show a decline in the purchasing power of public sector employees, while private sector spending power is increasing.
Luke said the fixed-term holiday cut will further sharpen the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many pupils per teacher can be
The OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the gap between the best and the weakest is growing all the time.
According to the organisation, educational outcomes are deteriorating, and the gap between pupils and regions is growing.
Bruins players' day peers as NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one
It's about eleven o'clock in the evening. A group of players in UCLA's American football have been left chatting to the other side of the campus's new training fields.
Some have been stripped of their glee; their backs grind from the hip after the first day of training camp.
For quite a few of them, this few minutes of chatting is a midday break.
Players studying at university summer courses return to the mortgage after three hours of practice to read the final exams; the next morning, they gather at half past seven at Wasserman Football Centre.
"The next three days are going to be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday's replacement Tuesday.
The umbrella organization for college sports reduced the number of daily training clubs from two to one, a change designed to lighten the workload of players, but it has extended their days -- at least until Friday, when the last final tests will be held.
That is why UCLA's first three exercises started over a quarter of seven in the evening. It was difficult to find space for the players' already full schedules.
Limiting training odds to one day means there are more training days than before; the camp began almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in Mora's six seasons as coach at Westwood that exercises are being held at the same time as summer courses.
The exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the opening match of the season begins: UCLA will face Texas A & M University in September.
Mora says he supported the NCAA rule change, although it made players "schedules even tighter.
"We load them very much for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work. They are great guys.
I think it will be easier when we get to Saturday, and then we will have more time.
UCLA closes exercises from outsiders after camp; it's not easy given the direct view from training pitches to the adjacent car park and Luskin Center, a high-end hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs flying across the protective net behind the goal box.
Bruins players are set to move into the hotel this weekend, but Mora admits problems could arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and film exercises on video from there. It is not an exaggerated concern.
Quite a lot is paid for the video filmed from the exercises.
But we have guards there and in the car park.
We will do our best.
I'm not going to bother my head about it too much.
We have a plan. "
Freedom in Rwanda
Presidential elections will be held in central Africa, Rwanda, on Friday, the winner of which is already being taken for granted.
Paul Kagame is officially seeking his third term, but in practice he has contributed to running the country since 1994.
That's when the rebel group, the RPF, ended the genocide organized by extremist Hutus.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticized for, among other things, crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of expression.
He has also been accused of misrepresenting poverty statistics, for example.
For a third term, Kagame will be able to seek because the constitution, which was limited to two seasons of presidency, was changed.
But in Rwanda, Kagame is also a genuinely liked leader.
During his time in Rwanda, social reforms have been carried out and international investment has poured into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting a country divided by genocide.
Rwanda's success has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
But Kagame, too, has promised his people more freedom after the country has been raised to its feet.
Now could be a good moment to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up facts check
Facebook plans to send potential fake news increasingly to independent fact checkers, as well as presenting the results under the original article, the world's largest social network announced on Thursday.
The company released a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news; any fake news will be sent to fact checkers and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest distributors of fake news, with many taking the view that fake news influenced the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The topic has risen to political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news ahead of May's presidential election and Germany, which is preparing for September's election, is backing a plan to fine social media networks if they don't remove hostile content quickly.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement released in Germany that the fact check was being tried in the United States, France, Holland and Germany.
"People want to see which stories do not pass the setup of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so they can decide in a more enlightened way what they read and share," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook's news feed, wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the related articles function and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The birth of a cartoon book: The story of a castle
The Little Scotney Castle in Kent County is now known for its Squeeze music video, as well as Margaret Thatcher's hiding place from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of turbulent history behind it; now this castle, located in a charming spot in the Bewl river valley, is the subject of a cartoon book written by Jamie Rhodes, a moppy writer who likes old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to study a text written by a person who died more than 300 years ago," Rhodes says catastrophically.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand."
Rhodes's book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families who lived in Scotney from the Middle Ages to the edvardian-era; each story has been filmed by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes's first book based on archives. In 2014, he appeared in Dead Men " s Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by the documents of the British National Library.
"I was moved to tears when I noticed the thumb trail in the letter, which was written by a double agent who worked for the dispensaries in the 17th century," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke, because at the time, fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel like he's on the ground himself.
I love the archives! "
The writer, who was attracted to the old documents, was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust and the English National Arts Council, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent the days exploring the Victorian "new" bastion, archives, treasures and anomalies, such as hyenas hung on the walls and bottles that had been in power for centuries.
He went around the old castle with ruins and bricks and talked to forest guards, gardeners and sometimes artists who imagine the book.
In the evenings, he "took whisky and started writing."
Scotney's closer history is fairly unknown, as the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust after only the last heir, Elizabeth Hussein, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff of the foundation were just starting to go through the repository.
In the archives there were diaries, letters from the days of the English Empire, and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that land disputes are boring, " says Rhodes." At this point, however, families are even dying from a single test.
It occurred to me that I would not be allowed to be already. "
Some of the stories in the book go from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer.
"The Book of Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot at the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The peasant rebellion in England began in the same region, and it occurred to me that the rebellion could begin with a riot.
Maybe these events are connected? "
Other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle -- such as The Priest, the story of a priest hid by the Darrell family for seven years during England's religious cleansing.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 17th century, who is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was spotted years later when his tomb opened).
The Darrells are the favorite family of Rhodes in Scotney. "The men of the family seem to have been a lot of stewards.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women.
Now, Rhodes is seeking new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a cartoon book about Life Mountain, a curator in the early 20th century, of which only the eutrophication plot remains.
Scotney Castle has a special place in her heart.
"It was sad to leave there," he says.
"I would not have wanted to go back to this daily life of the evil."
Relations with Russia the worst since the Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated markedly, commented NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is more difficult now than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, "Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO remains committed to working to ensure that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid escalation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump was able to say that relations between the US and Russia had even reached dangerously bad levels.
Trump called to thank the countries for their poor relations with Congress, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitshko quits - a rematch against Anthony Joshua won't happen
Vladimir Klitshko, a longtime heavyweight world champion in professional boxing, will end his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who struck gold at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, played 69 times as a professional, winning 64 of the matches.
He held various World Cup titles between 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost the last two matches of his career.
He was punched by Tyson Fury in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitshko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a frenzied match with a knockout in the 11th.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet in a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
Klitshko, however, found no motivation for the match.
I deliberately used a few weeks to make a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley match, "Klitshko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional wrestler, I got everything I dreamed of and now I want to start my second career after sport.
I could never have imagined having such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitshko's reasoning for his decision on video.
Klitshko's manager, Bernd Bönte, said in a statement that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to quit if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, "said Bönte.
Since 2009, Klitshko has partnered with US actress Hayden Panettiere.
The couple have one child, daughter Kaya, who was born in 2014.
Klitshko's big brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight world champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated the World Cup titles of various federations at the same time.
Finland's weather cracker noises conditions: 'Take a field'
Seiväsjumper Minna Nikkanen has suffered conditions during the summer's external border season.
Minna Nikkas has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and cold have taken the woman from her fiance.
There are unstable conditions at the World Championships in London, too.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
The conditions have been this winter against search-jumper Minna Nikka.
I wouldn't want to blame the track, but it was inconceivable that I couldn't even get the little seals to properly move, "Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I've competed and practiced here umpteen times and I've never experienced such varying wind in this place, "Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
It's been really tricky to standard jumping this season, with such volatile winds in practice too, Nikkanen noted at the Kaleva Games.
The weather was also speaking in London on Thursday.
It's been quite challenging to get the technology together - whether it's cold jumping or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken a fig.
It makes no sense to consume energy in a bad situation.
He reached his hallowed 455 thanks to the World Cup.
445 have gone outside.
The relationship is not the same for everyone in London.
You have to have composure and expect better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 in Friday's qualifier.
Why don't you change to train abroad?
It is not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany at the start of the season.
I got the jump on the pile and the technology standard.
You probably should have done the same thing now.
Normally you've got into the hallway to practice, now the hall has been closed.
What would it be like to race?
25 degrees warm.
There will be a little wind, as long as it is constant.
An experienced ex-official boasted politicians at One: "We have nothing to share now and not for many years."
Despite the positive climate in the economy, Juha Sipilä's government must hold firm in the hat and be wary of inflating the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets for decades at the Treasury.
According to him, there is no room for division.
Yle interviewed Virta, who retired in 2015, on Wednesday Night Live.
Construction of the state's budget for next year is just beginning.
Politicians' proposals that have surfaced recently include raising the guaranteed pension, lowering car tax and supporting electric bikes, Virtanen sees as election talk.
They mainly indicate that elections are starting to be close, because when 10% of the state budget is funded by additional debt, we have no room for division now and for many years.
I even think it's a betrayal to talk about sharing assets when debt is taken, "Virtanen said to Young.
Virtanen stressed that all debt is owed to the children.
Virtas has a long history of preparing state budgets: He started in 1978 as budget secretary at the Treasury and then worked as deputy head and head of the budget department.
Most recently, before his retirement, he served as Secretary General of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
Virtanen pointed out in an interview that the 3% economic growth now forecast is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is a thorn from which to start as early as next year, and Finland faces a 1% increase for decades.
Washington changes rules for permanent residence permit
President Donald Trump announced, according to media reports, that the rules for permanent residency, or Green Card, will be changed by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, tighten requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and backed by the president.
The draft law is due to be debated in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy, "Trump said, according to the media.
The wife of the Queen of Denmark does not want to be buried with the Queen in the same place
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareeta.
Photo Prince Henrik and Queen Margareeta filmed in April.
Queen Margareeta of Denmark, 77, and her spouse Prince Henriki, 83, will not be buried next to each other, according to the Danish court.
Traditionally, governing couples in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The royal house has today announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried at Roskilde Judiciary Church, the court notes in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT, the reason for this is Prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It's no secret that the prince has been unhappy with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, Lene Belleby, head of communications at the court, commented in the paper.
For Prince, the decision not to be buried alongside the Queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as an equal to his spouse.
According to the court, the Queen has long been aware of her husband's wish for a burial and understands the decision.
Horror moment on the road: The car was to come on top of the motorway
Tomm had an unmarried partner and two young children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but will not receive any money from the insurance if the other party is not reached.
The crash happened in the case of Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Arsenal image from the construction site of Circle III.
Tommi, from Vantaa, says his family miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his unmarried partner Riina and the couple's two young children were driving on the motorway at Keimolanport in Vantaa in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
From joining Circle III, a white car was driving along the acceleration lane, which was to drive into the side of the family's car, Tommi says.
Without the color movement, the car would have come on, according to Tomm.
I rushed and turned the car at the same time, and it went out of control, Tommi says.
The family's car collided at high speed with the cover.
The parents and two young children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is just under 3 years old, the other less than a year old.
It was obviously pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No one who drove was even driving towards us, even though there was a lot of traffic.
The accident happened around 5: 20 p.m.
Tomm said no one stopped to them, and the family called the emergency services.
They got out of the car on their own.
Staff from the ambulance and emergency services came and the family's condition was checked.
The car went into redemption condition.
Tommi says he and the unmarried couple had a small income, and they received a grant from the family to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without information from another car, the family will not receive any money from the insurance, according to Tomm.
That's why the family is hoping for observations from eyewitnesses about the car, which is why the family drove to the cover.
We need a car just every day.
It's tricky to take children to the zoo and go to work without it, says Tommi.
Tommi saw that the car was white, an old car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thought the start of the car's registration number was a sig.
If you can't catch the culprit, I don't know how to cope financially, we're going to have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that those who have seen what happened or know anything about it will be in contact with the police.
The police department in eastern New Zealand and the emergency services in central New Zealand are confirmed to have had a mission on Tuesday night at the scene of the accident.
The headline and story was corrected at 9.15pm: Contrary to what was originally reported in the case, the second car, according to Tomm, did not enter the lane of the receptors, but was to drive from the accelerator lane to the side of the family car.
The show, directed by Lotta Jäppinen, deals with relationships by means of humor - the self-detective is seen at the What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, brings her first directing to What? Theatre.
The self-detective is a musical theatre show about relationships and inadequacy that have gone wrong.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still leaves a good mind.
The subject is dealt with by means of humour.
You don't get caught up in the nasty feelings, "he says.
The rotating summer theatre performance has been carried out with a picnic budget and a large, young heart, according to Jäppinen.
The name of the performance challenges you to consider what you reveal about yourself when you get to know a new person.
Will he perhaps take on a role, or will he approach another jacket open?
Juoneton performance mixes fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatised the performance.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The proposal consists of the texts of the working group and is not a ploy.
The director believes that while the show sheds light on young people's thoughts, it speaks to people of all ages.
Jäppinen stresses that the detective does not directly indicate his own or the relationships of the task force.
Fact and fiction blend.
Your own set of values will certainly be conveyed by the performance.
I do not think that relationships are bad, but nor do I think that a relationship, especially a relationship, is a prerequisite for happiness.
Many people learn from their divorced parents
Jäppinen believes the self-detector is drawing a current picture of young adults living in Finland at the age of 100.
He said many people have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom have resigned.
At least the fact that you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance will feature Minea Lång, Niklas Rauté and Otto Rokka.
The task force also includes dresser Ella Snellman.
The atonement of music is Jäppinen and Roka.
Love for the theatre broke out in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying to be a director of theatrical expression at the Art Academy of Turku Polytechnic University.
There are two years behind and in front of another mokoma.
The enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the Kouvolan years.
The music class breeder has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and performed at the High School Theatre in Helsinki and, most recently, Linnatheater in Turku.
Directing has started to become more and more interesting.
The self-detective premiered last week in Helsinki on the Narri stage.
The show, which takes about 45 minutes, should also be seen in the future, at least in the city of Jäppinen in Turku.
Self-detective at Kouvolan What? Theatre on 4 August at 19: 00 and 5 August at 14: 00 and 19: 00.
The Finnish Olympic champion recovered from a gruesome motocross accident for a year - a neck duck broken
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
There were hundreds of days a year around the world in the middle of a slippery slope, chasing his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtela movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainee, but also an experiment in new species.
There may not be many forms of exercise on earth that have not been tested at least once by the chemical lake.
It has been inspired to practice.
There is always something new, Lahtela says.
In the end, one hobby was to stop Lahtela altogether.
In 2014, Lahtela was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I was nowhere to work.
I slept wounds at my home for a year, Lahtela says.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a part in the refuge.
Driving with a prince can sound ferocious.
But I did not seek any limits on it.
It is just a species so hard that this sort of four-year-old should not be too engaged!
After the accident, Lahtela found himself in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
Behind it was a long roll as head coach of Japan's freestyle team.
Lahtela started at the estate just after his own career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be in my place.
I didn't really do much, "says Lahtela.
Even in his coaching time, Lahtela often challenged his protections in the slope and physical tests.
Surprisingly, it was a good experience to stop.
I was physically and mentally so tired that my own thoughts didn't seem to make sense either.
Not even with the species.
Did good to be in place.
I actually enjoyed it because I really just got to be for once.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtela as Finland's head coach.
Without stopping, he fears he would have burnt out.
It is easier to find places in Kropa that have passed away than they have been!
Without the accident, I wouldn't have realised that I needed a rest so much.
Lahtela started as coach of Finland's freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace speed controllers.
I switched motocrosses to frisbeegolf!
After all, it came out of the lap straight away.
At worst I was seven hours a day throwing.
While Lahtela has always been a super keen trainer himself, he does not insist his coaches are the same as him.
I'm not forcing everyone into the same mould.
There is room in our species culture to be their own and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been consistent with that, Lahtela says.
Sex robots come and we should be worried
It's here: A report on the development of technology in the sex robot industry -- just as it had begun to feel that 2017 can no longer become more bizarre.
Yes, it is.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within the next five to 10 years.
"We need to start taking seriously the prevalence of sex robots," says Noel Sharkey, a founder member of the foundation and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the colour of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nuns and the type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are being hiked, but they're already sold quite a lot, and we're going to see more of them," Sharkey said at the report's release.
Sex tubes have evolved from blowing dolls to robots with silicone skin that feels warm, as well as features created with artificial intelligence that resemble human behaviour.
The user can also adapt the robot to their own preferences, from the color of the eyes to the shape of the nuns and the type and colour of the fingernails.
Even more worryingly, the robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, for example, as a swim.
The Roxxxy Gold robots of True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts to the user's personality as fully as possible," the company's website advertises.
In other words, a robot likes the same things as a user.
It also has a different mood:
It can be, say, tired, with a story wind or "that wind."
There are many worrying features in the prevalence of sex robots, which replace genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies as a user approaches, for example, a robot programmed to swim and resist.
On its website, True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot with a vibrator:
"Women have a vibrator. Why shouldn't men have a sex robot?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their prevalence and development is indicative of something darker and deeper in our culture: The decline from gender equality to sexual intercourse, where submission is one option among others.
Of course, most men don't get a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, even if the FRR report reflects their growing popularity.
Marginal phenomena, however, tell a lot about the spirit of the times.
And many will only start behaving strangely or offensively when the market gives permission to do so.
It's no coincidence that sex robots have begun to proliferate at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world and there is a president in the White House who has boasted of harassing women.
In the television series, The Handmaid " s Tale (Orjattaresi) is not the most troubling of its powerful visual language, for example, images of hanged bodies and eyes dug out.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now there seems to be a surprisingly short trip there.
Trying to make sex robots as much like real women (on the scale of porn stars) as is technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel authentic and movements to mimic human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far removed from reality.
The robot is unable to leave the relationship or situation.
They have neither the will nor the history -- nothing referring to independence or breaking the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Orjattaria.
Police suspect: Two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, the group was led by Isis chief
The extremist Isis chief led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take a bomb onto an Etihad Airways plane.
One of the leading figures in Isis had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.
There were suspicions that the bomb was to be taken to the plane on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before a security check.
Police will not elaborate on why the company was interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a device containing toxic colourless gas and take it to a crowded public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were apprehended in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation also continues.
The pros of Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like a beacon of common sense
In the Trump-era, it has already been repeated to the point of saturation that the powerful divide among voters at everyday level has also divided families.
Around Christmas and Valentine's Day, counselling pieces in American newspapers provided guidance on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want to burst into our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to unite families.
I will tell you this because my cousin was visiting me in New York this week, a left-leaning poet in Chicago who has long had buttons at odds with our family Republicans.
He recalled that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousin all acquaintances -- including a pro-Republican sibling with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades -- are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, that is a good thing, but, more broadly speaking, there are significant risks involved.
Trump has given new power to the left, but the perverse effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalisation," we are talking about the terrifying possibility that one day we will no longer be able to terrify his tricks.
In the long term, there is an even more horrifying possibility that Trump will normalize the right fringe Republicans, who, compared to Trump, suddenly seem quite reasonable.
I remember, awkwardly, Mitt Romney's restrained version of madness: A dog on the roof of a car, a 14 percent income tax (and his tax returns we've seen at least); compared to Trump, they seem to be very mild violations.
Once the Trump-era is over, the next Republican presidential candidate only needs to be clear-headed, and it immediately feels like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our kids to the Central Park carousel, the largest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best you can get in New York for $3 without caffeine.
Karuselli's horses are huge, the characters in the middle -- grotesque clowns and animals looking behind in horror -- are ominous, and the chilling music in the background is oddly fascinating.
Many of New York's hallmarks loom into disappointments over time: Views of tall buildings are starting to get bored, the city's sizable becomes too familiar and the city's reality doesn't match dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I have not completely overcome the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large transport circuit in north London.
The Central Park carousel, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience -- to the extent that two two-year-olds, one month-old and two women in their forties enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel full points if someone had asked for my assessment, but luckily no one came to ask questions.
Instead, I was asked this week at a department store to assess my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars, before I put my credit card on a reading device.
It's the same in a cafe on my home corner, but there I'm also given the opportunity to combine an estimate of 15 per cent service money when I go to the coffee counter myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer servant to put his personality in the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The department store salesman smiled with regret as I wearily gave my credit card user experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Interpol - "There was no management confidence."
FC inter have today released Shefki Kuqi from the club's representative team coach duties.
The coaching responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Piccareta, who was previously an assistant coach.
The rest of the coaching team will continue in their current roles.
Italian Piccareta has been an assistant coach in the past, including in Sunderland, England.
The 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined Interpol's coaching team in January, has completed a UEFA Pro licence last year.
Stefan Håkans, chairman of the board of FC International, regrets what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuqi no longer had the confidence of the club's management, leaving no other option now, Håkans commented in a club statement.
Piccareta's contract runs until the end of the season.
He, along with the rest of the coaching team, is already responsible for tomorrow's home match against HIFK.
According to data from Ilta-Sanomat, the team has been bubbling along Thursday.
Kuqi told players on Thursday morning that the club's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been set aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta rallied strongly in the Internationals match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius released an image of youth from the '80s - would you recognise a serious violin student?
Visitor Linda Lampenius released a photo of her youth on Instagram.
A number of hackers have been added to the picture, which suggests that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student.
Lampenius himself wonders about a young woman looking seriously at the camera.
Long ago, as serious, he signals.
If the image is not visible, you can watch it here.
Lampenius has previously released images of his past and also talked about painful subjects.
Just over a year ago, she posted a photo of herself on Instagram.
In another image she is seen 20 years ago, in another she is posing now, as a mother of two children.
In her caption, Lampenius discusses her own growth as a person and points to eating disorders she suffered when she was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look much the same as that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and how I look, "Lampenius wrote.
After the text she had added in English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, getting older is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating cages of previous years.
She was already in hospital at the age of 14 for anorexia and ortorexia.
A little later, he also became ill with bulimia, which was eventually revealed only in 2006.
The healing began gradually.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was sent from prison to hospital for chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for wildfires in his wrist, which he received after falling in a cell, according to prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed against the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, firing several shots through a toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a nighttime intruder who was hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again, as they believe Pistorius' six-year sentence is too lenient.
The attorney general plans to appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court and the appeal could be heard as early as this year.
If the appeal is accepted, Pistorius's sentence could be extended to 15 years.
We do not have the death penalty in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians who were illegally camped were arrested in Greece, reported the country's foreign ministry, according to BTV.
Police arrested a group of unlicensed people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, including two Bulgarians.
They were still released the same day, but the investigation into the incident continues.
According to television channel BTV, the State Department later announced it had released the Bulgarians.
Greek authorities have tightened rules on free campuses and are already issuing substantial fines for anyone camping in areas other than the designated areas.
The inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The ministry announced that the court may impose a fine.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may ease irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares of the digestive system.
However, a recent study argues the opposite: A diet high in meat protein and dairy products may ease irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects around 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in Great Britain, causing stomach cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Those suffering from irritable bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptofaani contained in the protein helps the body develop lymphatic cells that strengthen bowel tolerance.
According to the study's director, Marco Colonna, lymphatic cells guard from the swamp and ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells that cause infections are balanced by cells that strengthen resilience and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, the result may be irritable bowel syndrome.
The experiments found that immune cells that strengthen resilience exist in mice with a specific bacteria in their intestines.
The bacterium in question needs tryptofaan so that immune cells begin to appear.
"We found a link between the Lactobacillus reuteri bacterium and the development of cells that promote resilience.
"The more tryptofaan in the mice diet, the more they had such lymphatic cells."
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptofaan can strengthen intestinal resilience and reduce inflammation sensitivity.
Studying the immune cells that strengthen resilience, researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that while one group of mice had such cells, they did not exist in mice of the same mouse species, which were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was linked to microbiomes in the intestines of mice, or the normal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses in the digestive system.
When the DNA of the mice intestines was examined, six bacteria were discovered that existed in those mice that had lymphatic cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were given to mice who grew up in a sterile environment, who had no intestinal microbiome and did not develop lymphatic cells, they began to appear in immune cells.
The researchers wanted to find out how the bacteria affect the immune system; they grew Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the liquid and transferred small amounts of liquid -- without bacteria -- from the mouse to isolated immature immune cells.
The immune cells developed into cells that strengthen resilience.
When the active ingredient was cleaned from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptofaan metabolism, known as indoli-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptofaan in the feed of mice, the number of cells confirming resilience rose by about 50 per cent.
Cervantes-Barragan says a person has the same resilience strengthening cells as a mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptofaan by-products from Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as mice.
"We certainly want to encourage the development of such cells because they control inflammation in the intestine surfaces," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"High levels of tryptofaanitas combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their spread."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a 'genius' in their ranks after striking a deal with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a 'genius' in their ranks after reaching a deal with Nemanja Matic, the midfielder debuting in Manchester United's ranks in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for £40m, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin, United's last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday, impressed as a defensive midfielder against the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not in the best shape yet because he was not involved in the blue-shirt Asian tour before the start of the season; he only managed 45 minutes on the pitch -- that needs to change before the Premier League season begins, according to Mourinho.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and mindset make him a genius -- he has an inherent ability to think in football," Mourinho says.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho began to wrap up his starting line-up for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, although the club have already done a "fantastic job" of acquiring three of the four players he has prioritised.
"Three out of four -- you have to give credit to the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Germany was bullied by flight attendants for two instalments
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth match of the World Cup qualifying tournament to Germany straight er 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany's routine level of play is high.
Steady their game was in every sector, Finland's head coach Tapio Kangaspeni said in a statement.
In the first two outings, Finland kept their opponents under pressure, but in the third period Germany were clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, so we were able to bowl along, "Kangaspeni said.
The most powerful in Finland was Piia Korhonen, who collected 14 points.
Finland, which has lost three matches out of four, will still face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Large jury already sent challenges in relation to Trump Jr's Russia meeting
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The grand jury, convened by special prosecutor Robert Mueller, has already sent challenges in connection with a meeting between Donald Trump Jr and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer known for Kremlin ties.
It is reported by Reuters, which at the same time confirms information revealed by the Wall Street Journal earlier on Thursday to convene a large whale crew.
According to Reuters, a large jury has sent challenges in connection with a meeting between Trump Jr and Veselnitskaya, known for Kremlin ties, which took place in the middle of the U.S. presidential election in June 2016.
Donald Trump Sr's then campaign manager Paul Manafort was also in attendance, as well as his recruiter, current White House adviser Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a large whale crew in Washington marks an intensification of the pace of the Russia investigation.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a large whale crew to help with the investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election and whether the Trump campaign or his entourage cooperated with Russia on the issue.
The grand jury will expand Mueller's rights to gather evidence, send challenges and force people to testify in a whitewash.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury is weighing up the evidence found in the prosecutor's investigation and deciding whether charges should be filed in the case.
British inventor microchipped himself to get into his home and car with hand waving
The British inventor is the first in the whole country to microchip himself so he can open the outside door of his home, get into his office and launch his car with a hand waving.
The microchip is between the thumb and etus finger of 33-year-old Steven Northam, who is now offering a service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of Northam BioTeq.
Northam is working with Geoff Watson, a consultant sleeping doctor at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hantts, to make the installation of a microchip meet medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technology as the microchips for cats and dogs, and it only takes 30 seconds to install it.
Northam's company also makes the locks of houses and cars compatible with a microchip, which costs £300 to deal with.
Northam is married and has one child and has installed microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4 car, which kicks off when he puts his hands on the steering wheel.
White House exhibition object cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's decision last month to fly a Navy helicopter to the southern lawn of the White House for an event featuring American production came to cost taxpayers $24,000, according to military documents obtained by TIME.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is known as Marine One when the president is on board it; it was the attraction at an event at the White House on July 17, 2017 to showcase American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials took a look at the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter, which was made in Connecticut, the samples included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a true from Mississippi.
The White House military office had requested a helicopter to the scene with a mission order only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn for an "extraordinary" event, according to documents from the Navy's HMX-1 helicopter fleet.
"I just wanted to make sure you were aware of it because it's an extraordinary event that gets a lot of visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 unit wrote in an email the day before the event to his supervisor, who is an assistant comendant for the Navy flight.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn on 17 July at seven o'clock in the morning and that the event would start at three o'clock in the afternoon.
The message also mentioned that if the helicopter's departure from the White House was delayed, another crew would be needed because of restrictions on service hours.
The original crew were in the helicopter during the incident, and the unit's security personnel were aboard the helicopter while it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents obtained by TIME whether another crew was needed in the end.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 questioned whether the event was in breach of the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act. We were told there was no violation," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the assistant comendant replied.
The Made in America was an official event at the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president spoke out in favor of health care reform in the Senate at the time, as well as looser state regulation.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their travels,
But using them only for photos is unusual.
Trumpi's actions drew attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of a presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, where Trump has strongly criticized his predecessor's use of a presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which showcased products made by American workers of American materials from all 50 states," said Lindsay Walters, White House press secretary.
Crews from the HMX-1 unit regularly carry out training flights in the Washington area and practice at the southern lawn airport to bring the president to the White House with centimetre accuracy.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 practice landings for the White House.
One official said flights to Made in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 hours that day in "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said the incident did not involve any other costs for the taxpayer.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in organizing the demonstration of the helicopter on the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 has no accounting for flights related to presidential duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the costs of the event.
According to the Defense Department's 2017 hourly compensation, the compensation level for the VH-3D helicopter is $24 380 per flight hour.
According to documents from the HMX-1 unit, flights from Quantico base in Virginia State to the White House and back took a total of an hour.
The White House says the cost of operating the helicopter is significantly lower.
"Reducing the cost to the taxpayer according to the level of compensation is misleading," says Walters.
"The estimated level of compensation includes personnel, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs to be taken into account in the annual budget."
According to a 2015 study by the RAND research company, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to showcase American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and therefore probably employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is entirely appropriate to point this out. "
It is not certain whether Trump walked in a helicopter during the event, but at least he struck a fire truck driver's seat.
At the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky ship.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."
Lightning struck the Vaasan line - trains will have to be replaced by buses
Passenger rail traffic between the River Seine and Vaasa has broken down due to a technical fault, according to the Rail Transport Centre.

Venezuela's state prosecutor calls for court to block the appointment of the country's new representative
Venezuela's state prosecutor has sought a court order that would block the appointment of the country's new representative.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the assembly elected in last Sunday's vote is expected to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, the country was elected with a mandate that could, among other things, change the country's constitution.
Chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega said the decision to block had been requested because of suspicions of electoral fraud.
Ortega has also started a voter fraud investigation into the vote.
He appointed two judges to the post after the British company that organised the representative vote said the results had been manipulated.
The company said the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities was about a million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated for the House of Representatives, and the elected 545-member assembly includes Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to changing the constitution, the assembly can dissolve the opposition-led congress and change laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the editing of the constitution as a way for Maduro to consolidate his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro, calling him a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, meanwhile, have announced that they will not recognise the new assembly.
Maduro argues that the new assembly is the solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, unrest has been going on for months.
Numerous people have been wounded and more than 100 have been killed.
Venezuela plunged into an economic crisis after the price of oil dropped.
Now, many people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when the new assembly is due to begin.
Russian man extradited by Finland sentenced to 4 years in prison in US
A Minneapolis court in the United States on Thursday sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senah to nearly four years in prison for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a request from the United States.
According to Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by Finnish border officials when he was returning home.
Finland handed Senah to U.S. judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian objections, according to AFP.
In March this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud with the benefit of millions of dollars.
Senah received 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah is expelled from the country after serving a prison sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry harshly reprimanded Finland after the arrest, saying the man should not be extradited to the United States.
In a statement, Finland and the United States were reprimanded for making an arrest in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish user names and passwords.
The scammers then used the data to further direct internet traffic to make cliche scams and spread spam.
Kenneth Blanco, vt. director of the Justice Department's criminal division, said the case shows that the United States is also capable of chasing cybercriminals operating in others.
We have the ability and willingness to identify, find and bring them to justice, "Blanco said in a statement.

UN says Afghan democracy depends on political role for women
The election will only be representative if all members of society, including women, can vote in them, said the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, interim head of the UN Assistance Mission, said: "Hundreds of women have been nominated for elections to provincial councils, three women are seeking to become vice-president and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on April 5, 2017.
The Taliban have made threats about the election at a time when international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said the women's contribution will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

The influx of certain types of tourists poses a threat to the region's culture
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The fury of locals is particularly focused on the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
Italy's culture minister calls it "eat and flee" tourism: The site is just a few hours away and rushing through the sights in large numbers.
Venice has been choked with tourists making quick day trips to the city.
It is difficult to move around the narrow streets and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the people of Venice no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic centre while hotels have come in to replace the homes.
The problems brought by tourism in Venice are written by The New York Times and The Guardian.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the current phenomenon poor quality tourism - low-quality-tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you are given two or three hours.
You follow the guide holding the flag from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St Mark's Tower, and turn back, describing the prevailing and problematic tourism of Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the running of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of cities.
It is also one of the most popular places to visit the historic centre of Venice.
The Church of St Mark is located on the edge of the tower.
The anger of locals is also mainly focused on cruise ships.
There are only 50,000 locals living in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, there were about 175 000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians demonstrated against mass tourism.
They say that tourism has eroded their quality of life, destroying the environment and driving residents away.
About 2,000 residents leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years' time there will be no tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who organized the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as ships bring Venice the revenue it so desperately needs and create a need for a large number of jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution is for cruisers to go further away from the historic centre.
Luciano Bortos, who lives in Venice, believes that the situation would surely change if the administrative area of Veneto, where Venice is also located, were given more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
About 20 to 30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
Are you driving in the direction of the Kuopio?

The information nights unfolded Thursday afternoon on the side of Lake Sil in the case of the Ilmestys statue, or golden collar.
I get along well without such attention
The 23-year-old runner has had to notice the bursts of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has released stunning images of herself in landscapes such as the Grand Canyon.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has emerged as a popular athlete in her current home country of Norway, not least because she broke a 26-year-old Norwegian record in March in a 400 metre run by touring the track round at 51.81.
A month later, he improved a 400 metre donkey run at the time of the Norwegian record of 55.38.
Iuel, who is working hard on social media, soon after his record, found that fame and publicity have their downsides.
Men around the world began posting pictures of their Iuellle sexual organs, apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account to outsiders.
I got a lot of "bumps" from unknown people, so I was forced to change my account to private, "Iuel told VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of pictures he received.
You can probably guess, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I get along very well without such a different kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
Her mother is Danish, father Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amal was 2 years old.
When Amalia was 12 years old, the family moved first to Namibia, then to Pakistan because of the father's work.
It was followed by Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university student at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he switched Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel practices under the guidance of three coaches, Leif Olav Alnesi, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask anything, they just issue regulations.
In Norway, the coach has a lot more time to deal personally with the athlete, Iuel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norway records at 400 metres and 400 metres adrift.
The football injury took snowboarder Janne Korve's entire career into question - now included in the World Cup: "Nice when you don't hurt anything."
Now it has been nice to count when nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has been able to really enjoy her beloved sport again this season.
As recently as last summer, the continuation of a career was at stake.
A football table strain injury had forced Korve on the surgery table in January and the leg didn't want to get any better.
He, too, had taken a hit in the racket.
In the summer, I didn't know at all what I was doing, whether or not to continue singing.
Sponsoridiils were broken and many things were open, Corp. says.
But that is how it is said that things tend to get organised.
The leg improved, the sponsor extended the contract by two years, and the blood started to pull up the slope again.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew that, at the latest, when I went to the slum once.
I was that damn, yes this again is so much fun, let's draw a couple more seasons.
The corpse was only able to count properly in September and October, but after a long recess, just working out as a painless has been a big deal.
Games Corp. has been circulated by only a few.
It doesn't hurt.
The races have never been the most important aspect of singing for Corve.
I have never counted because of one race.
Mu finds it frustrating to aim for four years at the same Games, and then you're in the heat for that week.
I can't think like that, "says Korpi.
Today Corp. will race in the halfpipe of the World Championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even if the individual Games don't hold him up for a shot, from racing at a tough club, he always breaks out.
According to Korve, the valuation of the Games organized by the International Heart Association has increased over the past few years, although some of the boards chose Norway's X-Games, which will be held at the same time.
Yes, these are important Games, visibility is big.
For others, however, the valuation will always depend on the conditions and the level of the Games.
The corpse is the oldest athlete on Finland's 12-man team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's pit, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to watch the younger guys go.
I remember when I was at that point myself that everything was new and was so sick excited about everything.
It also brings new power to itself, Corp. thinks.
On the slope I still somehow keep up, but otherwise I don't, that's what's flowing in the guys!
Against the backdrop of a career in sport, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of managerial legend Pekka Korve is addicted to rap sports: The plaintiff has his own track horses for which he makes training programs.
When I'm in retreat all the time, I don't have time to be in the mall.
But every day I look at at least the rave results and usually something to start with, "says Corp.
Racing and track coaching is a potential career plan, according to Korve, when the board career comes to an end in due course.
I don't mind planning that far, but it's at least a likely option.
I feel it so that a little bit like I'm studying it here, along with snowboarding.
I try to stay on the nerves of time and develop, in the summer I might be driving some starting point too.
If it's mum's future profession, then it's not hard to start when you're already inside the sport.
The rallies also include an Elitloppet-track cruise with presenter Jaajo Linnonma.
The barrister has chartered a cruise ship heading to Stockholm for the Elitloppet-food race in late May.
The Corp and Linnonland decided to resurrect the old tradition.
The cruise has been well traded, and people have been excited.
We are now at a point where at least there will be no bankruptcy.
There's still a few months to go, let's hope we can get the ship full, "Korpi says enthusiastically.
Attendon's nursing home project for Kite has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new, 41-seat care home for elderly people to be built for Kite.
The building, which is worth more than 1,700 acres, is expected to be completed next summer on the other side of the health road next door to the health centre.
At Kite, a common cause for amazement is where customers will be enough for the new care unit, as now, during the Siu wars, many private nursing homes are poking up customer shortages.
Anne Flink Attendo, regional director of care services, commented that Kite will have more demand in the future, not only for options but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, "says Flink.
Attendo bought private nursing homes Kanervikola and Eerika from Kite last year.
The deal involved the business, but there is reportedly a five-year lease on the property.
Flink says Attendo has no acute need to move operations out of these facilities.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of McVitie's brand Scottish plant
The trade union is seeking confirmation from the directors of the McVitie " s inventor for a long-term commitment to production at a factory in Glasgow.
According to the Scottish section of the British General Trade Union (GMB), the company has not announced its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The plant, which makes Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits and other products, has more than 500 employees.
The Pladish company, which owns McVitie's brand, said it had invested more than £5 million in the plant in recent years.
The company added that employees and union representatives "will certainly be the first to be informed" if changes are to be made.
In a letter to the factory manager, GMB urges the company to "respond to concerns about the lack of funding to modernise production lines."
Drew Duffy of the GMB trade union is deeply concerned about the lack of clear information from the factory manager about the needs of Tollcross's business and future investment plans.
"Families have been working here from generation to generation, with a strong focus on the local community and the metropolitan area of Glasgow.
From the perspective of jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as Brexit, rising living costs and a continued reduction in production, Eastern Glasgow desperately needs a successful McVitie's production. "
According to a spokesman for Plato, the factory manager had only received a letter from the trade union the day before and the company will respond directly to the letter because it appreciates the ongoing interaction with workers and union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and representatives of the GMB in Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed a number of issues.
Among other things, we discussed with employees that, like other companies in a highly competitive and uncertain market, we are constantly evaluating all of our businesses and offices in order to remain competitive. "
According to a spokesman, the company has invested more than £5m in the Tollcross factory in recent years, particularly in its production lines and improving operations.
"We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a manufacturing plant and will certainly be the first to tell the workers and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the operation of the plant."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret his interest in Marco compared
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up their pursuit of Neymar after paying a £189 million transfer fee to end the contract, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record move three years ago?
The sensational move is the most talked about case of the summer; the French Ligue 1 football squad is poised to break the world record for transfer sums; the previous record was less than half that: It was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a £89 million transfer fee.
Following the move, Neymar will be the most expensive footballer in the world and also the best paid professional athlete in the world, with PSG offering him a weekly salary of more than £500,000 after taxes.
Barcelona are known to be furious at PSG's action and the way Neymar has left the club by force, with a source close to Barcelona reporting that the club has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived at Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG chairman warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned clubs looking for PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they beat our players, we will be their opponents and we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they beat our players, they're going to have to face the consequences. '
Barcelona appear to be guilty of just that: It expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco was compared earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances and it may well be that Barcelona are losing their star player Neymar as a result.

Now: Trump-heckled calls were invented - a White House spokesman said: "I wouldn't say it was a lie."
The White House admits that two calls cited by U.S. President Donald Trump never happened, according to the New York Times.
Trump-sued calls with both Mexico's president and the head of the patrol organization have turned out to be invented.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed there had been no phone calls.
However, he said Trump did not lie.
According to Sanders, many of the leading figures in the scouts spoke to Trump personally, and with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieton, Trump had talked to Hamburg at the G20.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty harsh accusation.
Those conversations happened, they didn't just happen on the phone but face to face, Sanders argued.
Speech to scouts sparked outrage
On Monday, Trump said the Mexican president had called him and urged Trump to successfully stamp out illegal immigration.
According to Trumpi, Pena Nieto told me that few will come over Mexico's southern border any more because they know the trip will, in any case, weather the U.S. border.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government issued a press release saying there had been no such call.
On Tuesday, Politico published a full version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump slammed his speech at a major meeting of the national scout organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the leader of the scouts, he said it was the finest speech ever given to them.
They were very grateful, "Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the scouts organization announced that it was not aware of a call from any of its executives to Trump.
According to the press release, an earlier statement by the organization's director, Michael Surbaugh, in which he had apologized to the scouts for Trump-speaking, speaks for himself.
Trumpi's speech at a meeting of the scouts organization caused much confusion, as it was exceptionally political in terms of the nature of the event.
Among other things, he slammed the results of last autumn's presidential election.
