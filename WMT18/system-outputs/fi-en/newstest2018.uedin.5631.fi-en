Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed with mental illness and now makes art on the subject - "People should be entitled to their own body"
Dozens of patient reports are hanging from the roof of the Academy of Fine Arts's Project Room.
Each of them reads the name of Camille Auer.
The papers tell a multi-year story of how outside people have written up their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell my personal medical history to make the violent nature of the process visible," Auer says.
In the process, he refers to the gender repair process.
It is often a years-long period of research that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, carers and doctors.
The process will start with the "gender identity disorder" diagnosis studies carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen he ordered via the internet and was already well advanced in his own repair process.
She felt that she was a woman, but under Finnish law a person must undergo a repair process so that the sex can also be corrected legally.
In other words, the Transgender Act (563 / 2002) obliges transgender people to have forced sterilisation so that the right sex can be found, for example, in a civil registration centre and passport.
At the moment, a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of reproductive inability are required for each gender to be repaired.
Man has the right to decide on his own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
The reform of Translaw has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight comments on the law and there is a precedent in the European Court of Human Rights which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish Government prepared the amendment of the law under the leadership of the then Minister for Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huovinen.
There were elections and the Finns came into government.
Now the change in the law is stuck again.
These are internal political disputes which do not even relate to this law.
"The government doesn't want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, executive director of the Amnestyn Finnish department.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installments.
One consists of the packaging and instructions of the medicines used by Auer.
In the statistical report, any visitor can read, for example, the transgender psychologist's interpretation of Auer at Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and, on the basis of these, wrote a report that would define Auer's right to treatment and assistance.
The sense of reality being studied seems to be exposed to instability.
The perception of the self that is being examined appears to be fragmented in a limited way, and the unstable characteristics of personality are highlighted.
Auer did not identify himself in those descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with a mental illness," Auer says.
An even bigger shock was when Auer was not granted gender repair treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
Then, on February 11, 2015, ­ Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked off a transgender waiting list for a television hack.
Later that television produced a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflexes his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any person defined as an emerging woman can magnify their breast, but you need a diagnosis to remove the breast," Auer says.
Your body is not your own if you feel anything other than the amount of your gender that is being born.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one of its kind.
For many, the gender repair process is more difficult for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people who have to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who are in need of support and assistance are denied treatment on the grounds that their resources are not enough," Auer says.
Many of those involved in the process have mental symptoms: Depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
For these reasons, medical staff may prescribe that treatment cannot begin.
"Preventing treatment and getting help can plunge a person into an even worse situation than it was before starting the process," Auer says.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I've had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and it's something that people tend to find difficult to digest."
Depression has been treated with medication and when Auer started taking hormones, it became easier.
He had been able to finally say the feelings that had existed in childhood and as a teenager.
That's why the broad jaw didn't seem to fit into your body and why the shoulder muscles had to be round instead of a flat breast.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people near him who see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using voice and movement," he says.
Nowadays, Auer already feels to be seen, she exists as a woman.
In the early stages of the process, however, the random comments of those nearby could hurt a lot.
Most hurt by the close misogyny.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they are not willing or able to internalise it," he continues.
However, not all trends require physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, where the body or its parts can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, there can be no official confirmation of their own gender.
"There is no medical justification for these studies," Auer says.
And that's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on self-determination with regard to legal sex.
A full-age applicant makes a written application for a new ID, indicating that he or she is of a different sex.
After a six-year period of reflection, the applicant will confirm his application in writing and the Ministry will give the applicant a new ID.
This right to self-determination is also required in Finland, and this demand is also encapsulated in the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist; the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still carries weight and can bring about political change, at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.
Camille Auer's exhibition at Antiphallic Dick 4-28 July 2017 at the Academy of Fine Arts in Project Rome.
Civil rights organization issued travel warning to Missour
The National NAACP, which advocates for the civil rights of African Americans, has issued a travel warning for Missouria due to discriminatory practices in the state and the racist attacks that took place there.
"NAACP's Missouria travel notice comes into force on 28 August 2017 and calls on African American tourists, visitors and local people to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when travelling in a state where there have recently been numerous questionable racial incidents."
The law, which recently came into force in Missouri, makes it more difficult to export discrimination cases to court; in addition, the enforcement of state laws disproportionately affects minorities, according to the NAACP, which led to a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of skin colour and beaten or killed, "NAACP Missouri Chairman Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
'We haven't heard of as many cases in the past in such a short time.'
The travel alert for Missouria is the organization's first warning to the US state.
The organization cited examples of racist comments made against African-American students at the University of Missouri, as well as the death of 28-year-old black supremacist Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year, driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel; he was arrested by Missouri police, though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel announcement also pointed to a Missouri Attorney's Office report that police stop a black driver 75 percent more likely than white.
"The purpose of the travel newsletter is to urge people to be vigilant and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People need to prepare, for example, by taking money to pay for guarantees or telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, a hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, the sixth most in U.S. states.
The travel warning is also a response to a new law in Missouri that makes it harder for companies to challenge lawsuits over discrimination in housing and employment relationships.
The ACLU, a civil rights organization guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they passed immigration laws that oblige police to arrest people for immigration violations, according to the organization, adding to racial profiling.
Generally, travel warnings are issued by the State Department and apply to other states, but recently they have been published by NGOs in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
YLE: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the supplementary pension of the CEO
State Corporate Governance Minister Mika Lintilä (kesk.) has asked Finnair to report on the additional pension contributions received by the airline's chief executive, Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
It is at odds with the will of the state, according to the minister.
The additional pension of €130,000 received by Vauramo came to light this week when Helsinki's Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of the directors of listed companies.
Finland's Kulie reported on Vauramo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said it would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has signaled that supplementary pensions will not be used to reward.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's policy decision on ownership guidance.
The sanctions immediately hardened the rhetoric
Not long ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on their way from cold to warm.
On the sidelines of the G20 meeting of industrialised countries in Hamburg, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to come to terms with each other brilliantly.
Since then, the mood has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions, approved by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday, were met with a smooth response from Russia.
Trump's response has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who says the sanctions bill signed by Trump amounts to a "full-blown trade war."
While Russian reactions would only be reflected in the escalation and excesses of political rhetoric, the heightened tension between the United States and Russia is a fact of life after a brief honeymoon following Trump's election.
In the United States, the passage of the sanctions law on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Admittedly, Congress passed the law with considerable unanimity, but for the president, the adoption of the law was much more difficult, according to the report.
Trump criticized his latest signing of the law as "significantly flawed."
Russia, in particular, may have been the cause of President Trump's fist, although the adoption of a law restricting its own prerogatives must also have been distasteful.
As is well known, an investigation is being conducted in the United States into both possible Russian interference in the presidential election and Trump's campaign's Russia connections.
The heightened tension between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
When White House staff have switched tight and various scandal-ridden turns have been revealed almost to be updated, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not conducted in the United States under the leadership of the president, but in spite of the president.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is the same in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's nuclear region in the Baltic Sea is tightening relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy towards Russia, at least on the face of it, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State that does a lot of trade with Russia, such as Finland, economic sanctions have been a real rip.
The effects of the recent U.S. sanctions law are still unclear.
There have been fears in the EU that the sanctions will make it more difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects can be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project and possibly in the Fennopower nuclear power plant.
The acidity in Europe has been caused by the fact that, for example, liquefied natural gas LNG, which is important to the US economy, has been excluded from the sanctions.
Trade sanctions are a way in world politics to show disapproval.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought out and rigorous.
Otherwise, they will easily do more harm than good.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House now has its sights on a Statue of Liberty
The absence of statues is the strongest sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as others: The Iraqis, along with American soldiers, toppled a statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the chief ideologues of the Trump administration, knew well what was going on in a heated argument with CNN channel Jim Acosta, a statue of Liberty that fell under Miller's attack on the president's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't exactly criticize the statue itself.
Had he done so, he would have been attacked by huge crowds of crutches and adorable characters from the Statue of Liberty.
His attack focused on the importance of the statue, especially the fact that in 1903 the statue's leg was added to the poem by Emma Lazarus - 17 years after the statue was completed.
This is how Miller slammed Acosta: "I don't want to go further into history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem was later added and does not belong to the original "Statue of Liberty."
Miller himself was not wrong, but it's not just about history, as he said himself.
Essential are the touching words of Lazarus, the only one of its kind in which the state calls not only immigrants, but "the poorest of the poor": "Your tired, your son, / Your huddled masses year.
The poem is now more topical than ever.
Miller was far from pursuing literary criticism; he made it clear that "the poorest of the poor" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The dispute over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural dispute over the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus's friends campaigned for the poem to be placed on the statue's foot; they knew well that the act was strongly political.
The statue was designed to reflect the connections of French-American republicanism with a classic metaphor, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: In his poem, the female character is no longer abstract but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: The mother of the deportees.
Linking the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
Rush Limbaugh - a commentator who can now be seen as some kind of predictor of Trumpism - claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not present anyone with an invitation, but is an early pioneer.
He takes the freedom to soar from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch "doesn't show the way to the United States."
Rare enough, Limbaugh was partly right.
The importance of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it like poor and exhausted but hopeful migrants from the ship's shoulder after a long and hard journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people seeking shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty is comforted by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's what Miller and Trump certainly don't want.
Their belly does not show the way, but fuels the flames of hatred, their only source of force.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of British national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots got into the British national team
Neil Black, performance director of the British Athletics Association, says the 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Cup are "significant confirmation."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.
According to Black, "something special is happening in Scotland," which British Athletics must learn from.
"This is welcome and we will continue to investigate it as long as we understand what is at stake," Black says.
"I spoke to representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute and they thought it was related to the Institute," he said.
The Scottish Athletics Association, on the other hand, believes it is linked to the operation of the union,
And the British Athletics Association believes it is driven by their actions.
And the ordinary street player thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it is something quite fabulous, whatever it leads to. "
Many Scottish athletes compete in London for serious medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competed with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000-metre race; Eilidh Doyle was selected as captain of the team.
'Eilidh is unnecessarily humble.
His captain's speech was incredibly fantastic, "Black says.
"The athletes left the event proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where you happen to live and exercise.
There was a genuine feeling and passion for the sport, "Eilidh said.
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medallist at the Commonwealth Championships in the 400 metres hurdles, and these are her fifth world championships; she believes it is "unbelievable" that there are 16 Scots in the team.
The previous record was seven from 1983 and 2015.
Middleweight runner Laura Muir has jumped five British and two European records over the course of the year.
He competes in London at 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare is running 1,500 metres in London; he is also worth keeping an eye on: The man has an outstanding season, including victories in Britain's World Cup qualifiers and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first world championships, when the national team's only scorer for his addition was Lee McConnell.
The national team captain says he is "immensely proud" that there are so many Scots involved, some of whom are seriously competing for finals places and medals.
"Being a captain is a great honour anyway, but it's even more special because the members of the national team voted for the captain," Doyle says.
'i'm obviously extremely proud of all the Scots who got into the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are joined by distinguished athletes competing for prize money.
My captain's speech?
I think it went quite well.
I focused on how lucky we are to have home games.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere is going to be absolutely fantastic. "
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't stand for public office if you don't withstand criticism
The father of our country knew what is bad publicity.
Americans loved George Washington, but newspapers soon began to criticize him for everything from possible domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism certainly irritated,
But he did not silence his critics.
"If the freedom of speech is removed, we may be led as empty and quiet as sheep to be slaughtered," Washington said in 1783.
That brings us to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their performers.
The American Civil Liberties Union challenged Hogan in court earlier this week.
His staff sees the challenge as unfounded, and the attitude was dismissive online as well.
"What matter? This is just Facebook," many commented.
But it does matter,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of a state controlled by Democrats.
He has received the second-best estimates of his activities among the 50 governors.
Hogan is unresponsive to the heat.
He has led the state firmly and held firm on principles.
He has also made a partial use of Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents and published there a picture of chemotherapy in a squalid reach.
That's why blocking users coming to the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous; the governor's page is a public and official platform maintained by his staff with tax credits.
Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions in an interview with The Washington Post, which she said was only about moderating comments.
But branding commentators as trollers, spiders or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their elected leaders, who were not trolleys, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They reported that their comments were respectful, considerate and factual.
In his comments, the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland's Bowie was not hostile but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I would politely comment on my disappointment that Hogan had not taken a position on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in the Washington Post's news commentary.
"I also find it unacceptable that, when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately regarded as some sort of organised mass and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments a "focused attack"; someone else could call them important to promote the things that were considered important.
In the age of Facebook, communication is easy to manage by blocking critics or removing critical comment.
In the past, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers where critical editorial papers had been published, or to arrest and silence the demonstrators.
But it really is the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public office holder to have been accused of shackling Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have challenged him in court.
The issue was given its first major decision last week in Virginia.
According to Alexandria District Court Judge James C. Cacheris, the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office violated the first addition to the U.S. Constitution by blocking a voter on Facebook.
And the American Civil Liberties Union held talks with Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This should not be difficult.
At the time of Washington, low-cost mail charges had a similar effect to those on the internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous authors hammered Washington.
There were trolleys back then.
Name brands Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to the newspaper in which they hailed Washington's decisions.
The president's office was flooded with petitions criticizing Jay's deal, the US-British cooperation, trade and shipping agreement, according to documents collected by the Papers of George Washington online project.
But he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the foundation stones of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
Summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about one in 10 locations, plus nett notifications for a couple, three.
Most of them have come from South and Southwest Finland, but then also from the individual Haapavän and Seinäjoki, the specialist researcher Marja Isomursu Easta says.
Green peppers have died of a parasitic disease called trikomonosis.
It is caused by an early animal called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to hit the pigeon and, in particular, the pulpit.
In the 21st century, however, the disease also began to be detected in peppers.
In 2009, we had a very good start.
At that time, trikomonosis caused a major collapse in Finland's green pepper stock, after which stocks of the species have recovered.
There have now been sick green peppers, but at least not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, a museum master at the University of Helsinki's Natural Science Museum (creation).
It is to be feared that the previous epidemic of green peppers will regenerate again unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: Stop the summer feeding of birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home-field advantage at Renaissance Club
Former European number one player Ronan Rafferty is hoping to benefit from a home-field advantage for the next three days with the 25th Scottish Senior Open at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian.
Northern Ireland's Rafferty led the tournament at the neighbouring Archerfield Links last year before the final round but eventually lost to Paul Eales; Rafferty is fit for a new place and will serve as the tournament's ambassador.
"I was watching the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event, it gets to its full glory," Rafferty says.
"The players see the pitch at their best. It's in fantastic shape.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He is a keen ambassador for the game and is proud of his achievements here.
The tournament is a great showcase for this field. "
Englishman Eales is defending the championship for the first time, despite winning his 32-year career on both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"This feels like a really special opportunity," a player who lives in Southport says.
'i was unable to defend my victory at the Extremadura Opens because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It is wonderful to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to mind: A tournament victory was a wonderful thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember. ""
Gary Orr returns to action on his own soil; he went on to join the tour after completing 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing at home is always more relevant than usual," Orr, who lives in Helensburgh, says.
"You want to succeed but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and playing pretty strongly.
I'm happy with my game so far. ""
The trio will be joined on the pitch by former Masters winner Ian Woosnami and senators majors tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots will take part in the tournament: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance as well as Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Car parking costs £5 if there is only a driver in the car, and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
The village explained the potential internal air problems of the barracks
At least so far, no internal air problems have been found in the basement building of the Pori Brigade, the Brigade reported on Thursday.
Internal air investigations are continuing.
The investigations began when a man who interrupted his equipment service for health reasons thought his health had deteriorated due to poor indoor air.
According to Colonel Mika Holman, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been identified in the health situation of other servicemen.
It turned out that this was an isolated case and other people who served in that unit had no health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to get to the bottom of this.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any internal air problem, Holma says.
The brigade's note says that as a result of the July arrival, the barracks have had to be moved to the barracks, causing the dust to increase momentarily.
As a result, the air may have seemed emotional, Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's golden country
Bardina Degei doesn't use cooking to relax.
After all, he is rarely used.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in Indonesia's troubled Papua province; when he prepares for dinner, he usually puts a bag - locally "nota" - directly on fire.
After half an hour, the batata, which was burnt into the carriageway, is eaten in a cramped, washed-up bowl.
Degem's home has no furniture; she sits on a muddy paint floor, where she usually also manages her daily clothes, such as laundry from a nearby suite in the haunted clay water.
The office of the toilet is supplied by a bucket in the living room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives and has not been ordered to play.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: Most of the men in the village are unemployed and many drink a lot, as well as the soldiers.
"No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening," Degei says.
The annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 villages were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch power, quickly turned its anger at the Jakarta government, which keeps the region firmly under its control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering the country.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Paid and Western Paid; the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is remote and a corner. The journey there begins with a one-and-a-half hour flight from the province's capital, Jayapura Nabiree, and continues on a five-hour drive.
There is no public transport here.
In the city of about 19,000 people, there are wooden houses surrounded by bambugs, whose wave roofs flowed into the basement brown.
Few Indonesians have visited here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago tribe hired the Uga Tamee god.
There have been other changes.
"We had no such clothes," Degei says.
"Before, we only had magazines on the cover of our houses."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia; 28% of its inhabitants live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold.
Paniai is roughly the size of New Jersey, with a population of 153 000; only about 100 kilometres from Panama is Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine. It is owned by Freeport McMoran.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper to Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, as they mean the repressive presence of a strong Indonesian army.
The New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and the military's local units between 1998 and 2004; individual officers were paid as much as $150,000.
Papua's demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income and are mercilessly silenced.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 priests and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the Papuan tribal highlands in the 1970s had the proportions of genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the region in peaceful protests.
The Brisbane Archdiocese report We Will Lose Everything from 2016 contains reports of atrocities in the previous year, including executions without trial, torture - rape and electric attacks are particularly popular means - and relentless attacks toward peaceful protests.
"Counting the number of victims is difficult because there are cases on a weekly basis," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been tightened as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83 percent of the province's 3.5 million people are Christian, but demographics are changing as Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi move to the region in search of a better livelihood.
The Javanese warung-food coconut sells fried chicken and a mixture of gado vegetables in a ground nut sauce.
It is difficult for local people to compete.
"Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the tower more cheaply than the locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Panama and moved to the province's capital after work.
"Local women lost their customers." "
Indonesian President Joko Widodo - nicknamed Jokowi - pledged during his 2014 election campaign to address the injustices and human rights violations in Papua.
Papua is made up of 29 regions, and this former woodworker won the vote in 27 regions, including Panama, on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted Jokowi in 2014 and expected him to fulfill our hopes and restore justice," You says.
Paniai experienced something of a wave just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs on the edge of the doldrums in Enarotal on July 12, 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle appeared in the dark.
Frightened children told soldiers they should wear headlights.
One of the soldiers did not like the comment; according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned to the scene with four soldiers.
According to reports from victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers captured the children and assaulted them with rifle wounds.
So one of the soldiers shot toward the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of the assault.
A couple of hours later, the State Election Commission building near the scene was set on fire and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand priests - young men and women as well as children - gathered on a football pitch in front of a local police station and an army command centre to demand justice.
They had a trophy for the celebrations, and began presenting the traditional waita dance in Papua's Mee Pago, dancing in the ring and tracking the bird song.
Some of the protesters began to stone police and army buildings.
When the mood heated, the soldiers received a command in the internal radio system: "If the crowds make resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," according to an official document seen by TIME magazine, which has not been made public.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, a resident of the Kego Koto region, guessed the situation was getting out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot on the left ranch," he told TIME with a whisper of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
"Several shots were fired in the crowd," the statement said.
Alfius Youwia was shot three times; his cousins saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," he told Yohanes TIME in sadness; like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
'i saw he was dead... I kissed him.'
Papua police chief inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that police only "protected" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"Then it's about life and death." "
Five young protesters were killed and many were injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
News of the killings landed in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
'i want the case to be investigated immediately so that it never happens again.'
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the justice system.
But he began to cancel his speeches straight away.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago," the statement said.
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the breaches, but it requires certain processes, "he said.
In an interview with Time magazine in Jakarta on May 6, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind, saying he did not intend to start investigations in Papua.
"Everything will be sorted out in court," he told her.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity" in connection with the deaths of more than a thousand people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999.
The families of the Paniai victims view the allegations with grim disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed in any way," Yohanes says.
'i'm already tired of that.'
He says he is still living in fear, even though the event has been going on for years.
"Yes I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me; I'm afraid I'll be fired." "
His brother Yacobus confirms that the panics are not afraid to discuss the event.
He says he had been assaulted by soldiers after helping to bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after the burial of the victims," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the Paniai neighbourhood of Deiyai.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between villagers and the head of a construction company that sparked outrage when the manager refused to take the man who lost consciousness to hospital, including children.
The man who needed hospital treatment was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been trapped in the water while fishing in a nearby river, who died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers showed up at a construction site in front of the company's office.
According to police, villagers thanked police who responded with warning shots.
However, according to locals, a mobile police unit of Indonesia's paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, leaving one villager killed.
"We are terrified; we are afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw when the wounded were brought in for treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days." "
Deiyai House has called for police officers who fired shots to be held accountable and for the rolling police unit to be pulled out of the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development is fuelling discontent in the Mee-, Mull, Daniels and Damal tribes, which live in Papua's wheat fields in the central highlands.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans with occasional attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of OPM's leaders are Panians such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The military has responded to the insurgency by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Panama in the name of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some of those arrested will never return.
Among Papuans, Paniai is known as a "sad, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
There is little rice for sale in Enarotal, and that too is too expensive for the local,
Like bread.
People grow their food themselves: Mainly baths and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Cultivation is women's work, and one woman can have four or five bathrooms.
Most of the rain is for the family, and the rest is sold in the tower.
Ten bathrooms cost just 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the livelihoods of locals and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes opened at Nabire airport.
There are few jobs, and they tend to go local to better educated and wealthier migrants.
Only a few batsmen have enough capital and know-how to run their own company competitively.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village because there's no work and no money here," says John Gobai, president of the Paniai tribal council.
Remote Papua is neglected in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua, although they had been granted a rare photographic licence; the official reason was the inability to co-operate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kinen, Asia deputy director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises; he has neither increased transparency nor promoted development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
"Journalists from Indonesia's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua are facing new risks: Refusal of visas and blacklisting," Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian Government is only under pressure from the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "numerous and widespread violations" of Papua, including.
These countries have traditionally also supported the Papua liberation movement.
Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia remains a democracy with freedom of the press, so covering up evidence of human rights violations would be tricky."
Locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When an official Dutch delegation led by human rights envoy Kees Van bar visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, the locals broke their silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says an anonymous source who attended the meeting.
There will be presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019, but the swans say they are no longer likely to vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who are entangled in Paniai's ammunition," says Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know the situation of the Paniaans: They live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in deprivation and poverty, virtually deprived of health care and educational opportunities.
According to Gobain, the Paniaans, like the rest of the Papuans, regard the votes given to Jokowi as a "debt" to be repaid.
"They don't want money; they just want justice," he says.
Despite the intimidation and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Paniai shooting once again showed resistance symbolically: They buried one of the victims at a police station and an army branch in the opposite country.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family members were killed," Yacobus says in head wrestling.
'What else could we do? '
Dereck Chisora hails the cancellation of Robert Helenius's rematch: "Even my own fans don't want to see"
Heavyweight boxing champions Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to play on May 27 at the Hartwall arena.
But the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora belts out the reason for flopping the rematch entirely to Helenius.
My apartment in Finland flopped, but it was not my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him match because he's miserable, "Chisora tweeted.
Helenius and Chisora first met at the packed Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
Ticket sales for the rematch went instinctively, with its promoter Nisse Sauerland telling Ilta-Sanown in May that the match had been postponed until the autumn.
There has been nothing new about the match.
But the cancellation no longer annoys Chisora.
After all, the match would probably have had to be cancelled anyway after Chisora fell ill.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up with severe pain.
My girlfriend was exploding.
The hospital said I needed to be cut, Chisora says.
The Briton says he is currently in a 45-degree condition.
By all accounts, he is not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but has Dillian Whyte in his sights.
Chisora suffered a defeat to Whyte in December with a split.
Fire blew up another Torch sculpture in Dubai
Flames stormed the world's highest locked residential building in Dubai on Friday, with hundreds of residents forced to flee 337 metres from a high-rise 79-story building.
This was already the second fire in two years in a building whose name happens to be a torch, a torch.
The building was emptied and no one is known to have been injured. The cause of the fire had no idea immediately after the incident.
'We were asleep and woke up with a fire alarm out loud and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took a dozen minutes, "a George-based resident told Reuters.
According to Dubai rescue authorities, firefighters were able to extinguish the fire at four in the morning local time and were left cooling the building.
The government said it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The incident could rekindle questions about the safety of materials used in high-rise buildings around the world.
The board of the Torch building commissioned an investigation after the 2015 fire, which found that the most affected were the discs used in the dressing room and insulation.
In Britain, police believe the insulation and curtains of London's Grenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid progression of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.

In the US, more than 20% of air passengers take banned items on board, reveals survey
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had taken prohibited items knowingly or unknowingly to aircraft over the US Transport Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints; at least 6% of passengers had knives.
Less than 1 percent said they only learned afterwards that they were mistakenly carrying weapons, ammunition or explosives.
More than a thousand passengers responded to the survey, carried out by the Stratos Jet Charters charter airline, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules than others.
Of passengers who deliberately violated TSA rules, 19.7 percent were Y-generation representatives and less than 15 percent belonged to the X-generation.
Most commonly, the rules were broken by exporting food and liquids to the aircraft.
In addition, 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men reported that they were deliberately taking banned drugs on board.
Passengers from across the United States took part in the survey. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many people had accidentally passed the security check and how many had done so deliberately.
It is not surprising that those who travel the most also take the smuggling goods most likely to pass through a security check - knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that conducted the survey says, TSA's instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids are allowed to board a plane and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of those seized by the TSA are liquids.
For a while, there was also the belief that books should not be taken off the plane.
Liquids may be exported to domestic flights but not to international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, tweeted his decision to delay Obama-era decisions to cut emissions
A day after 15 states challenged U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA Director Scott Pruitt to court, Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smog-causing emissions during the Obama administration.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he leads will take better account of the needs of state environmental decision-makers than previous administrations.
Pruitt made no mention of the lawsuit filed against his previous decision in a federal appeals court.
The Länder should begin to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone from 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would move the implementation of the decisions by a year to give his agency more time to study the plan because the agency "does not want to interfere in local decision-making or hamper economic growth."
Pruitt was a public prosecutor in the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as EPA director; Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to block or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical industry and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback to Pruitt's plan to ease regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA director exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay implementation of the Obama administration's decision on oil and gas companies, a decision that required companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday night, Pruitt argued that his U-turn on ozone regulations would only strengthen the EPA's cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements on schedule.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to challenge it in court to reach an agreement on timetables," Pruitt said, challenging the environmental agency in his previous action more than 10 times.
'We don't believe in regulation through litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We are also serious about the regulation on our activities and the powers it gives us. "
But an EPA statement said Pruitt could continue to use his "powers to delay the implementation of decisions as well as other legal powers" to ensure the regulations "are justified and based on the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader change in ozone regulations.
The bill, passed last month, aims to delay implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was brought to court this week by the EPA, said the group plans to keep up the pressure.
"EPA's change of mind as a result of our complaints is a significant victory for the 6.7 million newborns and more than 115 million Americans exposed in their communities to the direct effects of smog," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the plaintiffs included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont
Ground-level ozone occurs when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause severe breathing difficulties for vulnerable groups of people, and is also responsible for thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising turnaround.
"It's worrying how much pressure was required so that the guy in charge of our breathing system used common sense," says Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration, whose ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-interest groups," the statement said.
Supercar manufacturer becoming street charger - "happens in Ferrari style"
It also plans to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to maintain its expansive status.
That is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari's style, chief executive Sergio Marchionne said of the plans at a briefing on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be unveiled next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer unveils its new five-year plan, Automotive News reported.
All East Savo measles cases of the same type of virus
The measles infection in Rantasalme is the same type of virus as previous cases in East Savo, reports THL.
The virology laboratory at the Institute for Health and Welfare has ensured on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in East Savo has the same viral strain with previous infections.
THL has ensured that the measles infection, which was confirmed by a ransomware person on Friday, July 28, is the same type of virus as previous cases in East Savo.
Based on this information, all infections detected in eastern Savossa are linked to the first measles outbreak recorded in the region in June.
The news is good because it means that we have not come up with other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that new infections from the fifth disease may occur until mid-August, and the epidemic is therefore not yet over, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, the doctor responsible for infectious diseases at Soster.
New measles infections, or their suspicions, have not come to light since the fifth confirmed incident.
However, it is still important for everyone to take care of the timeliness of their own vaccination protection, Erkkilä recalls.
More on the subject: Pirkanmaa secured three new measles infections - "further infection or epidemic very unlikely"
Finland prepares for a licensed race
The Pontika soup was not even considered to be legalised.
The underlying argument is that the process produces wine along with methanol, which is toxic.
The manufacture of Kilju at home is legal next year, but the legalization of the pontiff's soup is not even considered.
Kilju is manufactured by fermentation, while the pond is distilled.
Behind the regulation of distillation is the argument that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, along with wine.
There has been no political will to regulate the soup of the pontiff as a right of public access, "government counsellor Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the ministry prepared the reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of the pontiff was not considered to be legalised.
Nor was it brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, "said Outi Mäkelä (kok.).
He is at the negotiating table of the parliamentary groups of the governing parties, which took a position on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
In the future, it will not even be possible to grant permission for the distillation of the pontika at home, even on application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain licensed.
Import tells us that the home manufacture of alcoholic beverages becomes a simple rule: Alcohol can be produced by fermentation at home.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally make a drink at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements for taste and flavouring substances and makes it possible to manufacture a kilo, Mäkelä explains.
The production must still take place in such a way that the raw materials, or the flavouring and flavouring ingredients produced when they are used, are clearly visible in the drink.
Under the new law, drinks can be prepared for themselves as much as they like, and alcoholic drinks can be given as a gift.
It must still not be put on sale.
The act of Kilju is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much bigger change occurred in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will come before the Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law will take effect in early 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament had already taken a position, Mäkelä is delighted.
Oscar Pistorius rushed to hospital escorted by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from breast pain, was rushed to a South African hospital for heart failure.
Pistorius has already been discharged from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence at Atteridgeville prison.
According to the British Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered chest pain but got out of hospital in the afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to hospital for investigation.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family, meanwhile, reported that the former top athlete is OK.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Leaked phone conversations reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build border wall
A flurry of phone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked to The Washington Post.
In a phone conversation on 27 January 2017, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Peña Nietoa to end his public remarks that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The US president phoned Nietoa that this had slammed the wall project in public; "you can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on America's southern border at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a flat on Trump's first phone call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull - a tense exchange of words during the call.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull that the agreement that the US would take refugees on its way to Australia is "ridiculous," "pathetic" and "foolish."
Trump ended the call by telling Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call of the day."
Georgia massacre: Activists recreate racist lynching in hope of justice
A Ford Mercury-branded car misses the crowd in the small town of Monroe in the Georgian countryside and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car; four armed men tumbled down the road before the car reached the bridge.
The gang leader, a middle-aged man dressed in a raided suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and tires through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n---u!" The man tweeted.
"Out of the car!"
Cries break the silence as a young black man is pulled from the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a rehearsal, presented on 22 July 2017.
But the scuffles of shock are genuine when the hanging silk pulls into the neck of "Rogers."
Human rights groups have since 2005 returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to reprise the events of 1946; at the time, the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George.
No one has been charged with murder.
"It's baffling that no one has been arrested over these years - even though the murderers are living among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with rehab arrangements.
'It's a disgrace in history, but most of all it's a burden that weighs on our soul '.
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia congressman.
For him, the revelation is a startling invitation to action; it also reminds the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want those responsible to be brought to justice; we want things to finally come to an end, and we want to recover from grief and reconciliation, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
'We can't recover and make reconciliation until we get right.'
A death investigator covers the body of the victim who died in the Georgia massacre on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI documents obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
But no one was charged with murder.
While the culprits have been free for decades, activists say the motives of lynching have been known to locals all the time: Politics and sex.
In 1946, black supremacists in the state of Georgia received a Supreme Court decision to vote for the first time in a presidential election; the Supreme Court ruled in April, and the election was held in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident at the time of the election, in which black rental farmer Roger Malcom stabbed white landlord Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently involved Malcom's wife Dorothy.
According to Brooks, the city was rumoured that Hester had had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting this child.
According to FBI records, influential white land owner Loy Harrison paid $600 in guarantees to Malcom on 25 July 1946, against which he was released from prison.
On their way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car ahead of Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and organised the murders," the FBI report states.
"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities, who were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses," the statement said.
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
"It was a vote murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has guided the revival of the Georgia massacre for nearly a decade.
The motion is extremely realistic and captivating; it is a description of the appalling racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States of today.
It is difficult to look at the motion, but it is even more difficult not to look at what is intended, according to Mrs Green.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our own dark side," the director says.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
The exercises for this year's presentation began in June; on the first day, about 30 actors - a dozen black and twenty white - gathered to listen to Green's rumored summary of the motion.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Green's deputy director.
He has portrayed the leader of the local Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always as difficult and distasteful.
"There's going to be a dirty feeling because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
'But it's important that this side of history is kept on display so that it never happens again.'
On the other side of the room, their shifts are practiced by Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, played by Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The presentation begins with a scene in which Malcom cries and stumbles at Hester, who is furious that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear? I said," I'm going to leave my country, n---u! "
Rascona or Hester responds.
Then leaves the lynch.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene is laughing the hardest.
"What?!" Rascona asks.
He is in distress.
"Did I accidentally get too loud?" He asks.
"Et," Greene shouted.
'i just don't think white people used the word n---u at the time.'
"So," another black-haired actress confirms.
"It's jargon. You have to use a longer version."
The subject of the motion is unpleasant, but the power of the room is crony.
Everyone wants to succeed, and not just because of the motion; they want to honour the memory of those who have been killed.
The encounter begins from the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are huge.
No one is laughing.
The revamp ends quickly and violently.
Shouting, shots - and silence.
A woman dressed in a black fundraiser stands beside her body while singing Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice is shattered by every other word.
A few ten metres away, fifty spectators are wiping their eyes with sweat and tears.
Almost exactly half of the audience are black and half white.
Among them is a couple who have come to watch the show from Ithaca to New York State, but most are local.
They have visited Brooks's guide to the victims' graves in Georgia's pressured wetlands.
The murders have turned the story into a reality; the mood at the scene is heavy.
After the lawsuit, Greene calls the crowd to inspect the bodies.
The children are pictured looking at artificial blood and immobile bodies and whispering to each other.
"They are not really dead," the little boy mums as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the audience.
The actors, who posed as lynchmakers, took off their cloak and wiped away tears.
BRADSHAW halts Marbaugh, the man who presented the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona halts two actors and then breaks down in tears after a tough presentation.
"Don't worry," the woman involved in the motion comforts.
'We know you're not him.
You did this for good reason. "
Later, the audience and actors gather for a joint dinner.
The white couple, who arrived from Altanta, are busy discussing the motion with the black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it hard to find words when she describes the feelings raised by the motion.
"It's hard to listen to horrible words and watch terrible acts that are said and done by people who look the same as you - just because they look the same as you," he says.
"The presentation made me realize that lynchings are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks commemorates the evolution of civil rights to the audience sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning for next year's draft.
"Rehearsal is a powerful experience because it depicts the horrors we've experienced, but it's also an educational experience," Brooks says.
'It's a message that this can happen again if we don't learn from it.
Those who don't know their history are doomed to repeat it.'
The game of vegetables in shops is sparkling: This is what the removal of 'extra parts' will actually save
Is it permissible to remove the flower-covered leaves already in the shop before weighing?
What about taking away a big hat from the anchor - it weighs how much?
The answers divide opinion strongly: For one, it is a sign of extreme nudity, while others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that they do not use and yet go home to rubbish.
Yes, the phenomenon is recognised in the shops.
For example, cardboard boxes can be found in the Ruoholahti K-Citymarket vegetable department in Helsinki, because many people tear off the leaf parts of the flower cake, for example.
From the box, the newspapers are exported to the biowaste of the trade.
According to a news release published by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, snacking on the vegetable counter amazes traders.
But how much does removing extra parts of vegetables before weighing really save money?
How significant is the snacking tool really about?
Us Women tested how the price changes when the antioxidant, latva artisan, herb mussels, parachutes and flower coats take the leaves or stocks away.
Flower cake: The price of the flower cake, which costs EUR 2.10, was EUR 1.80, when all the leaves were removed from it.
Ananas: The price of an entire anathema, which costs €2.30, jumped to €1.95 when its stock was wringing away.
Latva artistry: The $2.60 price came in at €2.40 when the short-lived stock was cut off.
Delicious mushrooms: Two delicacies cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price came in at 60 cents.
Balcony: A medium-sized balcony cost €1 and without a stock of 80 cents.
The end result: If the leaves and stocks go out, save a few dozen cents at best for one of the vegetables.
The price of vegetables, considered as a percentage, fell by as much as 20%.
So a total of EUR 1.20 would have been saved from these purchases!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - the brass star broke a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, reports news agency AFP.
Earlier on Thursday night it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a €222 million exit price for FC Barcelona, who played in the Spanish league.
The soaring €222 million transfer fee is the biggest in football history.
Previously, the record was for Manchester United, who paid €105 million last summer from Frenchman Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league bragged about the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment from Neymar's representatives.
Under league rules, the buying club cannot pay the exit price directly to the seller, but the player himself has to buy his contract out, which is done by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG have paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to have arrived in Paris on Friday.
He will be presented to a potentially new home audience at the opening of PSG's season against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA investigates the details
Barcelona also said in a statement that it would provide information on the fee to the European Football Association, Uefa, so that the union can determine any disciplinary action that might arise from the incident.
Among other things, the president of the Spanish league, Javier Tebas, has suspected PSG of violating the rules of Uefa's financial fair play.
UEFA can punish a successor who makes more than €30 million in losses over three years.
According to UEFA, Neymar's transfer does not automatically violate its economic clause.
Neymar's transfer to PSG will affect the club's finances for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
PSG may, for example, sell a number of players in substantial amounts, UEFA was informed.
PSG is owned by state-owned qatari company Qatar Sports Investments.
The club is chaired by a former tennis professional, qatarian Nasser al-Khelaifi.

Austin, 21, received severe burns from a lightning attack - a stamp was stored on an airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing ordinary work measures on a plane at Lounas-Florida International Airport with a couple of commuters when suddenly the wet sky was hit by a lightning plane.
The force of the lightning threw the plane's wings to the ground near Dunne.
Dunn was rushed to hospital.
He had third-degree burns around his body.
My father phoned me and said my brother got an electric shock and he is in hospital.
But I asked if he was alive, "Austin's sister Autumyn says.
Austin spent two weeks in the dressing room.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and a brain haemorrhage.
The experience was tough for the whole family.
There is no such thing to expect.
It's traumatising for everyone, "Autun says.
According to an airport spokesman, the lightning warning system was on the ground at the time of the incident and the transport business itself will decide whether to comply.
Pearson to cut 3,000 jobs and revive business by cutting dividend
British education group Pearson announced on Friday it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut its dividend by 72 per cent by launching a new restructuring programme in response to pressure on its business.
Chief executive John Fallon says job cuts will mainly be made at the end of 2018 and early 2019; the company already cut 4,000 jobs under previous restructuring arrangements.
Pearson announced it would cut costs again by £300million in May as part of its third austerity programme to revive a weakened business as a result of a rapid digital shift.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann, a company that said it would keep its outlook for the current year unchanged.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber struck a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul; according to authorities, a NATO soldier was killed and several others wounded in the attack.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack, according to a NATO statement.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh district of Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month; on Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people died in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to a NATO statement, Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint patrol between NATO and the Afghan army was attacked by a "person carrying a self-inflicted explosive device."
The statement reported that all the injured were in a stable condition and were being treated at a US military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of an ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are significant concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, including 20 percent in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul in an area mainly populated by Shiite Muslims.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in the centre of Kabul, the deadliest militant group in the country since US-led forces plunged the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the volatile situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump is considering whether to send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses its decision to postpone implementation of smog regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA reversed its decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smog-causing emissions during the Obama administration, a day after 15 states challenged the agency in court.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 so-called "ozone regulations" late Wednesday, according to the agency, a decision that reflects its commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states," Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement from the agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the agency's intention to delay the implementation of ozone regulations by one year to October 2018.
On Tuesday, the agency filed a lawsuit against 15 predominantly Democrat-controlled states, including the District of Columbia, saying it was illegal to delay enforcement.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to ease environmental regulations under Barack Obama; Trump says the measures are part of a broader economic growth agenda.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who worry about the health effects of rising emissions.
According to the EPA's website, inhaling air containing ozone "can impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
A person belonging to Isis's senior figures was also sent to Sydney for building parts of the bomb, according to Sydney Morning Heraldi.
According to the suspect, the bomb was supposed to be taken off the plane on July 15, but the company was interrupted before a security check.
Police will not elaborate on why the company was interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a device separating toxic colourless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport facility.
Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were captured in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continuing.
Liquid CEO: Renewable fuels did well
Oil processor Neste's result before taxes fell, but slammed forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company made a good performance in oil products, sales volumes for renewable products rose to record levels and the development of operating profit in the Marketing & Services segment was moving in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by a tax break for U.S. Blenders Tax Credit.
According to Lievosen, operating profit for renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and a more favourable market, even as the tax break came to an end.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and complete our previously announced strategic investments in 2017, "Lievonen said in a news release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatchenko discuss a potential match in their first meeting
Vasyl Lomatchenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course for the near-most interesting boxing match of the 66.7-kilometer series, faced each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel's premises in Los Angeles until WBC's undefeated light-heavyweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the WBO senior featherweight champion.
Garcia won at Showtime on Saturday with the unanimous decision of former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner, after which Garcia and Lomatchenko have been among the top five on a comparable list of heavyweight boxing players.
Garcia grabbed his right hand and asked, "How do you go, champion?
Good luck for the match! '
Lomatchenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN in round seven on Saturday.
When the tweet was posted to photographers, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas pointed out that the men's match would be "perfect in terms of sizes."
"I'm a former featherweight champion," Garcia recalled.
'i moved the series to a senior [63.5 kilograms] for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I am a small size 63.5-kilometer.
I want to go back to the light series.
He has to get up in a light series [61.2 kilograms], then we can sample.
That's what our fans are hoping for.
Meet their wishes. "
Lomatchenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this match." "
Klimas was asked if the match should be played on the pay channel; it is part of his strategy for Lomatchenko to debut in the lightweight series later this year and match up next summer against Garcia (37-0,
"The match could be on the pay channel because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced he was ready to match the channel offering the best prize package.
'We're the most interesting names.
No one else wakes up as much attention.
It suits me as soon as an agreement is reached....
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as an "incredible match" and perhaps planned to go and watch Saturday's match.
Lomatchenko interrupted Garcia's flurry of praise and said this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "really slow. Fingers crossed, Mike... but you needed a knock."
Garcia said he focused first on showing the attacking force and then boxing.
The men said they felt there was a growing desire for a match between them.
'This is the match expected.
No other match inspires as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this stuff, "Garcia said.
Lomatchenko said he expected to get into the match against the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's going to be a great match. ""
Average salary €5,300, training whatever happens - the situation of investment advice was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has talked a lot lately.
Most recently, Helsinki's Sanomat reported Ritva, 68, to whom the investment advice of the banking movement spoke in full when selling investment products.
The rules for investment advisers and the sale of various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The tightening will be based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisers and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not define skills requirements.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service carry out their own APV1 or APV2 exams.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of qualifications for a company called APV investment qualifications Oy, whose qualification working group is composed of experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry.
The qualifications are between 12 and 15 credits and are prepared by Aalto EE, the Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides business management development services.
Its website reports that, in general, both tenants are "quite extensive in terms of requirements."
The learning materials for qualifications include 10 to 15 books, as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku savikko, chief executive of APV investment qualifications Oy, says that the pass rate for tenants is roughly around 70.
Of the staff of the largest banks, roughly all those offering investment services have completed either APV1 or APV2, as they are compulsory under their own rules.
Then there are smaller bank accounts, without mentioning names, whose staff seem to shy away from carrying out their qualifications, clay says.
According to him, there are "a few" such bank movements.
According to Saviko, the APV1 qualification has been carried out by between 13,000 and 14,000 people since 2000 and the more demanding APV2 qualifications recommended to investment advisers by about 3,000 people.
Some bankers consider graduates to be an advantage.
A number of other sectors have significantly stricter skills requirements.
Clay says that a recommendation in the financial sector requires APV qualifications to be carried out, because that is where the expertise in the investment sector will be ensured.
According to the Bureau of Statistics, financial and investment advisers earn, on average, several thousand euros a month, including commissions, in-kind benefits and performance bonuses.
The average value of regular working time for monthly employees is approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men working in jobs earn more than EUR 5 900 per month and women earn more than EUR 4 500 per month.
On average, the tens of people who earn the most earn around EUR 8 100.
The tens of men who earn the most earn more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, a tenth of the women who earn the most earn EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
Up to now, there has been confidence in self-regulation at employee and job level.
According to Fivan, its audit received individual cases in which the expertise and competence of the investment counsellor was not sufficient on the basis of the counsellor's activities.
It is also possible, in principle, to act as a seller of investment products, even if skills and qualifications are at a low level.
As a matter of principle, the situation has been wild and free.
More other industries have significantly stricter skills requirements, clay says.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened up with the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II).
It requires each company to be responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently skilled.
Financial supervision, on the other hand, will have the power to determine what to know.
Marko Hovi, market supervisor at Fivan, says that one of the clear changes to the current situation is a piece of legislation on the skills and experience of investment advisers and sellers of investment products.
According to hov, the new requirements apply both to investment firms' own staff and to captive agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
Hovi says that, according to a government proposal from the Ministry of Finance, Fiva would have the power to dictate skills and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided in the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, where necessary, follow-up and further training.
All of this has to be documented, and the company has an obligation to show that this has been done.
Hovi specifies that, in practice, the company must, for example, map out the tasks of the staff at an individual level.
There will certainly be different standards for this, depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to hov, there is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced than the deadline if the knowledge or experience is not at an adequate level.
In other words, if a company employs a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work for a certain period of time with the person who meets the criteria.
According to hov, the change will make the rules tougher and more tangible.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened in early 2018.
Image caption The 787 Dreamliner passenger plane "besieged" a giant plane on top of the US
The plane flew over the United States in the service of Flightradar24.
The flight was carried out on Thursday by a 787 Dreamliner plane, with Boeing testing the durability of the plane's Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane, which left Seattle, flew 15,700 kilometres in 18 hours and 1 minutes, longer than any available permanent commercial scheduled flight in the world.
The flight stayed all the way inside the US borders.
It flew through a total of 17 states.
Imatra's persistent rank-and-file pupils do not notice the rain or the sun's escape - Iines Kaikkonen Polski doggedly with the help of a swimsuit village
Iines Kaikkonen moved at a good pace, Talways Itkonen followed.
Beach schools in Imatra will revolve around the sludge and Lempuka this and next week.
Even if it rains and then shines again, the young bathers are not moksy, praised by the swimmer Talways Itkonen.
A total of 13 children will be enrolled in swimming schools this week, a dozen next week.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that school and eskari are already starting, says Itkonen.
The beach school in Imatra is organised in cooperation with the county-linked project and the city of Imatra.
On Thursday, the slurry beach had a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and the young swimmers were training to stay afloat with the toilets, someone was already in the air.
Smaller siblings were also comfortable in the water.
Iines All, 5, was first dubious about going deeper into the water.
But Talways Itkonen encouraged him to kick towards the beach.
Well done!
Iines Kaikkonen is reported to have spent a lot of swimming this summer.
The slurry beach is good for him.
Like Iines All, the season-ending villain was busy swimming with Vili HUHTANEN, 5.
You too can be pleased with today's achievements, "the swimsuit praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, again wanted between waterboarding.
Ilona Villberg, 6, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, swimming from the beach, sees the beach school as a good start for swimming lessons.
Even though the weather has been what it happens to be, Anna is happy to go here every day.
Sometimes you had to warm up.
Diving schoolchildren packed into the pond.
The boys drank larvae with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Lukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread the pastry with towels, nailed the fruit and paired the day.
The lesson went on in the water, but there was no rush on the floor.
One that does not belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier is selling water exercises - "Here is such a unifying story"
You see all kinds of things.
A few days ago, Sinituote, which produces cleaning products, launched an unidentified soldier product series.
In other words, the artistry and laundry scaffolding - as well as the "wc-grey on the edge."
The unknown soldier refers to the film and the marketing of Leffa, which will take place in the autumn.
Still, there's something special about the mix, and the products are irresistible on social media: When are the upcoming Tunteunta health ties?
You have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määtä, the deputy chief executive of Blue Products, say?
We are a partner in the film.
We are supporting this film, as are many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, "Määtä says.
According to him, there will be a special presentation of the products, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn't there something a little funny about this - often when you think that products and accompanying stories have something in common?
Yes, this is such a unifying story that we are a Finnish player and these are Finnish products, "Määtä says.
According to him, the company supports his same Finnish fundamental values, which are supported by those who have seen an old unknown soldier.
And cleaning is no stranger to army culture, Määtä points out.
Other business partners in the unknown soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwallin's vichys have been placed on the market, with names such as Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products have already been recovered by the Finnish Kulie blogist Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and bells are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the next evening of the film, so there is more to come.
Unknown partners have not yet revealed their military products, such as Valio, processor, Neste and German retailer Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
New results of age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden announced
The latest results of the medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been made public, and the results of the tests carried out under the new evaluation method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were identified to be over 18 years old.
Sweden's National Legal Medicine Agency began testing earlier this year.
Tests can assess the age of an asylum seeker more closely; a new test was introduced after Sweden's immigration agency was criticised for failing to determine the true age of applicants claiming to be minors.
The immigration agency has conducted 6,880 tests so far, and the Office of Legal Medicine has now released the results of 2,481 tests, which were conducted between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Of the 80% tested, the 2002 asylum seeker was identified as being over the age of 18, and in 25 cases, the Office of Legal Medicine determined that the test was "possibly 18 years old or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under the age of 18."
The tests were only carried out in cases where there was reason to doubt the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson from the Legal Medicine Agency says the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The numbers are pretty consistent; there are no big differences in the statistics of previous months," he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were identified to be over the age of 18, that does not necessarily mean that applicants have lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases there were "indications that the investigation is 18 years old or older."
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly told him that he would be 18 years old this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of polvinivell; then dentists and radiologists analyse the images; the method has also been criticised.
One of the doubters is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karoline Institute, whose work involves assessing people's biological maturity.
'i've had reason to think about it and I think the method used is not the right one.
Determining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we are certainly not able to determine age, we should not pretend we can do it, "he told the Metro newspaper.
However, the forensic agency Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is greatest in a situation where the test will soon be 18 years old. Then the risk is about 10%. "
Ilonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland
The five-over par result in the third round celebrated Mikko Ilose's 30-point lead at the top of golf's European Tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left on Saturday for a jailed place at 11, but was found at the end of the round to share a place at 41.
In a difficult yellow, Iloselle begged for three bogs to be followed by one tuplabogi.
Others were tricky.
Englishman Ian Poulter rose to share the top spot in the one-under-par round, although he was told there was enough work to be done on the umbrella.
The angel was raw, but I roared along and in the end the day was good, Poulter tuumi.
He shares the top spot with compatriot Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
West Virginia governor to change party
Jim Justice, the Democratic governor of West Virginia, announced Thursday night at Trump's campaign event that he would change the party.
"The Democrats simply rejected me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough consideration... Today I tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The audience erupted into raucous applause.
"As a member of the Republican Party registered tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say to you, it's time for a new game." "
Trump previously promised a major announcement at a campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won by 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016; according to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited his father from a mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
His property is worth about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) released a statement Thursday night that "Governor Justine's party change is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, which is building barriers rather than a better America."
"Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before; in this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership and is unable to find a positive, people-unifying message," RNC.
Salamat sown damage - Thursday becoming even the hottest day of the summer
For the rest of the week there will also be more swimming in southern Finland.
During the past week there have been thunderstorms, especially in the central and northern parts of the country, as well as in the region of Southwest Finland.
On the night of Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes sparked several fires.
According to Meteorology, Thursday could become the hottest day of the summer so far.
The rescuers have finally found Finland as well.
Over the past week there has been lightning, especially in the central and northern parts of the country, as well as in the region of Southwest Finland.
At the table, the lightning hit the electrical centre of the riverside house, causing a small fire.
The rescue service received a notification of the fire about a quarter to midnight on Wednesday.
The electric center was located in a sauna at the end of the riverside house.
A rescue worker smashed a roof and a wall to find fire extinguishers and extinguished the fire with a bucket of water.
A total of eleven homes were left without electricity, but injuries were avoided.
On the lookout again, the lightning detonated an external building on an airfield in Harjulantie before midnight.
When the rescue service arrived, the building was already in full fire, and the rescue facility could not help but prevent the fire from spreading.
An external building of about fifty square metres was burned to the ground.
In Kuopio's direction, the lightning hit the self-contained house.
The occupants of the house were outside the building and witnessed a marked salamander attack.
Rescue crews visited the scene to check the incident, but this time the lightning did not cause a fire - only a few melted heads.
In traffic, the ukkonen caused problems on the train line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when a lightning attack damaged the traffic control system.
Information about the villa was reached between eight and nine on Thursday morning, after which trains in the meantime were replaced by buses.
It was only a little before five in the afternoon that the problem was resolved.
Since then, train traffic has been able to continue normally along the thunderstorm track.
Salamat has wreaked havoc across Finland.
But lightning has been relatively low this summer.
These thunderstorms this summer have been quite scary! Assessed by the Meteorologist Jari Tuovinen of the Meteorological Institute.
Wednesday's and Thursday's thunderstorms have been mainly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the lack of lightning in the summer, that too seems to many to be even strong.
This might seem like a really tough thunder, but that's what it's been compared to this summer's swim, "Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, the terrain climbed 1,700 times, and on Thursday there has been potential for even the coolest thunderstorm of the summer: By about 16 p.m., there were 1,790 terrain in the plaque.
If the lightning continues into the early evening, then more than two thousand lightning can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record-low lightning year occurred in 2015, when the year's salad volume was around 30,000 copies.
By Wednesday, this year's salad had risen to 18,386 salts.
So there is still catching up so that this year does not break the "record" of two years ago.
However, the thunderstorm can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air above Finland will also remain warm and wet during the rest of the week.
The focus of the thunderstorms is expected to shift from the northeastern parts of the country to the south on Saturday, where you can get around 2,000 salad days on both Saturday and Sunday.
There will be a more uniform cladding in the middle of the country.
In such cases, according to Tuovinen, the thunder is only hardened.
CoE praises Russia's' open-minded 'apology over doping scandal
World Athletics boss Sebastian CoE praised his open-minded description of the apology made by Russia over the doping scandal on Thursday, but CoE added that it was not yet time to end the Russian participation ban.
Russian Athletics director Dmitry Shljaytin said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Cup on Thursday that the ban received by Russia is appropriate and that he is determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry "for all the athletes who were deprived of a gold or silver medal in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to extend the ban; Russia was ruled out of the Athletics competition in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency's WADA report presented evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his response today was very direct; it was a very open-minded presentation," IAAF president CoE told reporters.
"The entire council and Congress welcomed the fact that the Russian Athletics Association acknowledged the country was going through difficult times and said it would do everything in its power to restructure its operations."
CoE said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the terms of the termination of the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendation that now is not the time to end the Russian ban," CoE said.
"We must do everything we can in the coming months to normalise the situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupted system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete for the status of a neutral athlete at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday, having met the IAAF's strict criteria.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia has yet to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
"The testing remains inadequate and the coaches who received the operating ban continue to operate freely," he told reporters on Friday after a presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
Production company disappointed by Tom of Finland film's poor success
The Tom of Finland film did not become the kind of success the authors hoped for, says Yle.
To be honest, I'm disappointed, "admits Annika Sucksdorff Yle, executive director of the Helsinki film, which produced the film.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it looks like it is.
The film got its premiere in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached more than 100,000 viewers, which is in the film's budget, about five million euros, compared to little.
No lottery profit has come out of this, but it is now important that investors get their own back.
If the film had been more successful at home, they would already have got their money.
Now you have to wait for small streams of foreign releases, "Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The provisions restricting the spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris Saint-Germain, the most expensive player transfer of all time in football.
Its potential penalties for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA regulating European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
UEFA introduced fair play financial rules in 2011, saying PSG must be able to prove that Neymar's transfer has been funded without major losses.
Barcelona were paid €222 million to terminate the Brazilian contract and Neymar's annual salary in the new club moves in tens of millions of dollars.
There are a wide range of economic aspects to Neymar's transfer to France.
PSG will have no trouble paying Neymar's transfer fee and linking him to their star squad, with the consequence of funding a dynasty rich in Qatari oil.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums of money on acquiring players, but they need to be balanced by real sources of income so that football-related business is not at a loss.
The economic rules of fair play were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platini, the French President-elect of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini argued that the pursuit of success with debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners pulled their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play financial rules shifted from clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used by Roman Abramovich for the first time in Chelsea in 2003 became significantly more difficult.
The current three-year review period of fair play financial rules will run until 2018, during which clubs will be allowed to make up to €30 million in losses.
Although Platini was forced to leave the role of UEFA chairman in a scandal-plagued 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin also wants to curb the club's reckless spending.
"The rules of fair play are still in place and we will continue to apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, responsible for fair play economic rules at UEFA, told the Associated Press news agency last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a lump sum, it could stretch the amount in the accounts for the full duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so the transfer fee can be recorded as an annual pass of €44.4 million for the next five years.
On the basis of fair play economic rules, the first sanctions were handed down in 2014, with the biggest sanctions imposed on PSG and Manchester City funded by Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a €60m fine, which was later reduced to €20m, and the club were also ordered to limit their Champions League group to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is monitoring clubs that might try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their revenue through the club's owners-related companies.
If, for example, the qatarian company supports PSG, but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, UEFA does not count the support as actual income.
That was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the Qatar Tourism Authority's support for PSG was excessive.
It has also emerged that some of Neymar's merits at PSG could be funded by fees available to Qatar's 2022 World Cup organizing commission.
However, PSG and the organising committee have denied that Neymar would be made an ambassador for the World Cup; it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
As a result of PSG's previous sanctions, UEFA is even more closely monitoring attempts to sidestep the rules.
Sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG over Neymar's transfer.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on condition that their identities are not disclosed because they are not authorized to discuss the situation at PSG.
According to the latest published accounts, PSG's turnover for the period 2015-2016 was €542.4 million and operating profit of more than €10 million.
Last season's accounts have not yet been made public.
PSG expect Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of successor products and game shirts.
The club estimates its turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent with Neymar's contract.
Clearly irritated by the departure of the world's best players, the Spanish league tried to complicate the transfer of Neymar, who was allegedly in breach of fair play's financial rules.
"This is a clear financial doping case for both the club and the state," Spanish league president Javier Tebas told the Spanish AS newspaper, referring to PSG's qataryan ownership.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state's funding of the football club's operations; Arsenal is owned by an American sports club.
"The incident is the result of ownership that has completely changed the football environment over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
'Everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the economic rules of fair play. There are so many interests associated with the famous player representing the state. "
Now in a hurry: Finland's World Cup athletes coach stuck in Helsinki
Spurs skipper Arttu Pajulahden and triple goalkeeper Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan are stuck in Helsinki, although he should coach at the IAAF World Cup in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete in the long jump race tomorrow and Mäkelä on Saturday in the triple jump.
However, the two-time coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not been granted a visa to Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the issue in a major British broadcast to no avail.
The candidate has the invitation of the organisers of the World Cup as a document, but even that has not been enough to obtain a visa.
I wonder if this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, "coaching director Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always handled visa issues successfully in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Federation Sul for years.
It doesn't make such a big difference.
As long as someone sees the signs at the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said of his coach's possible omission.
Image copyright PA Image caption Finally London is calling for a miracle
The World Athletics Championships will begin in London today on Friday and take a fair week to finish on Sunday 13 August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the species that Finnish bench athletes can be passionate about year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other indicators.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one race to another, where experience matures the athlete's performance to the level that an adult World Cup medal is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in the small World Cup team in Finland, and indeed there are no contestants.
The World Medal for Finland is calling for a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sport is that miracles can happen too.
It draws bench athletes to the television screen and glue to watch the Games, even if the London medals are resolved due to the time difference until late in the night.
From the previous World Cup in Athletics in 2015, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by the chef, Tero Pitkämäki.
The Users are looking forward to a long medal even now, even though the other shows the recent results of him and the other cast, as well as the absence of Longhill in last summer's World Cup.
Whatever happens in these Games, Pitkämäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sporting hero.
For other Finnish athletes in the Games, getting to the finals or making their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal of Finnish Athletics in the coming years will be a great success for young people at the international championships this summer.
The processing of young talent and financial support for its work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success will not come in an instant, but will require years of hard work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns can also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully the London Games will go down in history as the Games of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, and not because of terrorist deterrence or cowardly attacks, for example.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copperin bang airs - "But I do regret"
Snowballer Enni Rukajärvi is ranked second in the big air race in U.S. Colorado.
The runner-up at Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi's best bang Air in the World Cup.
The women's contest was won by American Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the contest.
He tried his last jump in the caballerial 1080 for the first time at the Games and was very close to succeeding.
A good feeling and a good fiilis is now, but I do regret that the last jump did not go well.
Yes, from now on, I'm going to try it again in the Games, "said Rukajärvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, a competitor jumps from a jumper made for the species.
Viking Linen's new picnic ship stuck in port in Helsinki
Shipping company Vikings's new pickup ship FSTR is well behind schedule.
The picnic had to go from Helsinki to Tallinn at 18: 00.
The ship had a loading operation in eight countries.
The ship came to Helsinki late.
For at least an hour and a half I've been waiting to get on the ship.
Now the car queue is moving slightly, the Estonian John Rebane, who is waiting to board the ship at the port of Helsinki, reported at 7.30pm.
Rebane thought the new vessel had become a technical fault.
Rebane reported that the shipping company had brought the ship access to water bottles waiting in its cars.
Vikings communications chief Christa GRÖNLUND tells IS that the strike became a technical fault.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
GRÖNLUND says the ship will also miss the return trip to Tallinn for a couple of hours.
The ship had to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 8.15 p.m.
A 42-metre special carriage disrupts traffic on the main road on Thursday night
The 42-metre-long special carriage moves from Moomino to the port of Mustola on Thursday night.
Transport from nine should be informed by the end of the evening.
The police are directing traffic on the main road, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
On the other side of the road, the carriage moves along the road 13 miles to the port of Mustola.
Little Circle nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, the story haunts both the characters' 80s glorious days and 90s grunge (at the time David Wain and Michael Showalter made their brilliant The State Sketsister MTV) and their own.
As a cultural product, it's both a parody and a description of the constant memory we've gotten in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it feels like a waste of time.
The First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humour (it was, among other things, the story behind the vegetable cans spoken by H. Jon Benjamin's voice).
At the heart of the joke is that the middle-aged actress displays her flawless complexion with her impending luscious teammates - an emphasis that makes the pursuit of the past an impossible part of the joke.
The TEN Years Later, in which adults show up as adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more patchy: It parodies, for example, 90s stalker cliffs, like a horror film with a hand.
At one point, one of the characters takes a dig at the Apple Powerbook, inline rollercoasters and "the rest of the street from 1991."
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still hasn't got over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot involves Ronald Reagan (also known as Michael Showalter) as his accomplice George H.W. Bush (played aptly by Michael Ian Black).
As always in this type of series, the best are side paths.
It is particularly fun to see the icon Paul Rudd, who has a partatupsu under his underwear, or Matt Dillon's "soul patch" from the film Singles.
Moments of random madness might elevate this series to the air as a kind of recognizable Seven Up! Series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer - Twenty Years Later.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series, on the other hand, appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: The Cold War spirit of the American series, the Atomic Blonde film and even the glow of the West.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and has been directed by Rhys Thomas.
In the main, the comedian Gregorina and idealist Iosefina are seen as Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici; their interactions are duped in English by Channing Tatum (the series's chief producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But it is not much more than that.
The series has some good visual jokes (police spend time watching TV chess in the same way Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slater, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, the Comrade Detective remains too caught up in a clumsy socialist drama - involving, for example, a killer hiding behind a Reagan mask - which is why the series often starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humour of the series is neither quick nor poignant enough.
Summed up, the series might work better as an agitprop satire, say, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two obese men in the lobby to cram the hamburgers.
The message to an imagined communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: We hid our own recent history and their history.
Kouvolan Toni Tauru rises to the ring in Macau on Saturday - facing former UFC champion
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match going.
Toni Tauru is enjoying a tough spell in Macau as Brazilian Leandro Issa still fronted the UFC organisation last year.
The Brazilian also has a juicy black belt and a world champion of the species.
For once, I match myself against a parent.
It's a funny thing, "32-year-old Tauru says.
Kouvolan had to climb into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three fights were completed with a quick timetable for the Chinese autonomous region of Macau.
Tauru has not encountered such a thing in the past.
This was the first time my match was cancelled.
It was annoying, as preparation and trey took a lot of time.
But Otter is pleased to have a new time for the fight.
The wait of the week has little effect on preparation.
The transfer does not appear to be in order, as it does not improve in a week.
Fitness can get even worse if you exercise too much now.
In a couple of previous struggles, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths are erecting.
This time, the situation is different.
Issa kouvola is described as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive guy.
I bet he's going to get tough in the first set and try to take the matchup.
He has won a preseason world championship, so he knows wrestling.
Kouvola's previous match did not go as planned.
Philippine Kevin Belingon struck Taurua badly in the eye and the victory fell to the Philippines.
I've never played so well, especially standing up: He didn't get any hits.
When I started to fall, he hit my eye.
It was harmless for a really long time.
New motivation
Some of the freelancers match once a year, some rise to the ring more densely.
For example, future opponent Issa last played in September.
Taurulla, on the other hand, played three matches last year.
We are now facing the second battle of the year.
Sometimes the pace has become heavy.
I've been training in recent years and been in good shape all the time.
But I've only been okay because of the match.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, she decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was training in Espoo and got the joy of doing it back.
We got some really good treens when there was one guy from Sweden.
Training was a great help, as on Saturday the hooker will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I have been able to work out against opponents of the same size and practice an erection.
Standing up is the 32-year-old's main tactic.
You have to bet sensibly.
If there is an opportunity, I am, of course, going to take a ton.
Lasers must not be given free of charge, as they consume the most.
Macau is attracted to Tauru in China in the past.
It is reportedly China's Las Vegas.
I think there is a big and wonderful evening ahead.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce it will keep interest rates unchanged after weak economic growth and easing inflation has stopped speculation about interest rate hikes.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to slow; the bank shifted interest rates because of increased pressure on family incomes.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's monetary policy commission decided by a 6-2 vote to keep interest rates at 0.25%; the rate hike received less support this month due to weak economic growth.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank lowered its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7 per cent and its 2018 forecast to 1.6 per cent, also warning of increased pressure on household income levels as inflation continues to accelerate to close to 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank said interest rates will be needed in the next few years to curb inflation fuelled by Brexit, and the bank also indicated that borrowing costs may have to be increased in financial markets more than expected.
In addition, members of the commission decided to cancel part of the massive economic package that began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The bank will close its Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to offer cheap funding to banks through the programme for £15m more, or a total of £115 million.
The minutes of the Bank's interest rate decision state: "According to the Monetary Policy Commission's forecast, the slow development of gross domestic product will continue over the next few years as the fall in real household incomes reduces consumption."
On interest rates, the bank reiterated the need for "some tightening of monetary policy" to curb inflation, with market expectations "slightly broader."
The market is currently predicting a first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
In May, the bank forecast growth of 1.9 per cent for this year and 1.7 per cent growth for next year.
Now it kept its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro in the wake of the news.
Against the dollar, the pound weakened 0.5 percent to $1.31; against the euro, it weakened 0.4 percent to $1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after weaker-than-expected growth figures dampened increased expectations for interest rates; GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its most recent inflation review gave little hope to households affected by rising inflation and meagre wage increases; the bank says the situation will get worse before it gets better.
The bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" a fall in revenue in the coming years, but it expects wage growth to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which will reverse some of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
The decision came a year after interest rates were reduced to 0.25 per cent in the wake of the shock EU popular vote, which plunged into a fall in the pound.
The bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to start to be reflected in prices and the economy after only four years.
Ahead of the central bank's latest decision, interest rates had become increasingly vocal as inflation tightened pressure on households, with three policymakers calling for a 0.5 per cent interest rate hike in July.
Inflation eased last month to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent in June, but the bank said it was better than expected and inflation will tighten again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess of its 2 per cent target was "entirely due" to the weak pound.
"Given the recent fall in Swap interest rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be tightening further as lenders are feverishly seeking customers and want to end the year strongly," says Andrew Montlake, director of Co.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end; price deals are becoming more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also consumer options available."
NHS to prescribe 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
From September, patients can be prescribed a "landmark" HIV prevention drug; the Supreme Court completed a dispute over funding for the drug in England's public health system (NHS).
The NHS announced that pre-exposure inhibitors (prep) will be prescribed to around 10,000 people during the first three-year experiment; prior to intercourse, the drug has been found to reduce the risk of infection by about 86 per cent.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after a court of appeal upheld last year's ruling by the Supreme Court, which allows the NHS to pay for the prep drug, despite claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, head of the NHS in England, called Thursday's decision a "significant new intervention" and the National AIDS Association described it as a "crucial moment."
Sex health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to receive registration for the experiment, which will expand in October to other clinics; the experiment will reach its full expansion in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (prep) is an HIV drug before intercourse, which reduces the risk of infection.
Tests have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV infections in at-risk groups.
A drug taken before intercourse means that the body has enough medicines to prevent HIV infection during intercourse.
The medicine can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The target group for the treatment includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people with an HIV-positive partner who do not receive effective treatment.
Clinicians choose to test the conditions for qualifying applicants from men, women and transgender people, as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and registered for general medical care can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost £10m and the NHS in England this week signed a procurement contract for medicines after an international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of the prep drug by collecting extensive clinical evidence for its targeting, taking and delivery of treatment.
"This significant new intervention should complement and enhance existing diversified and increasingly effective ways of preventing HIV," says Stevens.
"It is yet another significant achievement in the battle that has been going on for more than 30 years to solve the greatest health challenge facing mankind."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Association.
'if prep medication is properly targeted at those who need it and those at risk, it could have a pivotal impact on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September, those at risk will receive, through an experiment funded by the NHS, a drug that they can decide independently without the need to negotiate with a partner, which will have a powerful effect that will improve the lives of very many people.
This was welcome news. ""
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and no one at risk is excluded from it," says Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The prep drug used in the experiment has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the prep experiment is a welcome event that dragged on in vain for several months due to a government slowdown," says shadow cabinet health minister Sharon Hodgson.
'We have evidence that medicine can have a pivotal impact on the work we do to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us better understand the real benefits of prep medicine.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible across the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society. "
Quality of life: Storefronts and smart interior solutions have made the small Earl's Courthouse a spacious home
Former banker Joanne Leigh, who was excited about the renovation of the property, moved from the Knightsbridge residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna's era-style house. The success of the renovation is illustrated by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed her campus and moved.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something similar in my price class.
I went to a housing show here and noticed that the rooms were as high as in my then flat.
I was lovely straight away and made an offer the same day.'
Since then, about 90 square feet of housing has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a cubicle where the bedroom only got out of the kitchen; Joanne wanted more storage space as well as a storefront to take advantage of the height of the room.
"I wanted space, big windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands, "he says.
He paid for work at the Duck & shed design office in Erfan Azad in Notting Hill, where Erfan was tasked with taking advantage of the space of nearly four metres of high rooms and creating an apartment that would not just be a renovation and sale, but a home.
The height of the room was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where you could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
'the steel structures are pretty complex.
The premises had to be duplicated in such a way that they did not need to be cordoned off.
The structures had to be shaped in such a way that the height is just suitable both on and below them. "
Erfan was able to invest in the space by duplicating two full-length rooms with fascinating details.
The storefront opens Retrouvius's copper-colored window into a stylish living room.
Mirror-style furniture, silver enhancements and Serge Mouillen vintage lighting create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatrical, space feel and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem real longer.
The mirror in the kitchen is like a window opening a view to another room.
In the mirror-lined furniture at the entrance, there is a storage room for Joanne's aterns and glass goods.
The elegance is enhanced by the fact that the kitchen gets hidden when it is not used.
Kitchens equipped with a taxi door are not a new solution,
But the unique thing about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of planning," Erfan says of the steel-reinforced rolling surface of the MDF door.
"It is balanced, that is, it is sliding very easily into place."
With sensible farm use and the design of a storage space, Joanne got 16 extra squares, a second bedroom and a better bottom.
"When selling housing, the area counts - or the valuation of the property," Erfan says.
"In the basic case, a real estate broker will walk into the apartment and drop the price on the basis of the area," the statement said.
In Joanne's apartment, the area was added using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The resident is in touch with the materials of the apartment, and the tunnel to the apartment is created partly on the basis of them," Erfan says.
'No one is paying attention to the power lines on the walls.
They are also important, but not in the same way. "
Joanne's apartment is an example that good design and listings can make the basic apartment exceptionally fine.
Then it can also happen that you no longer want to move away from the apartment.
Pregnant Princess Sophia radiates her summer locks
Princess Sofia's housing choice hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before her birth.

This is the last representation event in which Sofia is represented before her birth.
His calculated time is in September.
For dinner at the event, Sophia had opted for a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed beautifully.
The style was crowned with large hoop earrings and an elegant small bag.
Pastelline dressed beautifully for the Princess.
Sofia has been on a mission to Båstad in Sweden this week.

He grows us with sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, a koju appeared on the tower in Lahti, where Thai food was sold.
The lads did not dare to taste, but walked over.
In Koju, the food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among acquaintances in Panja.
He did not know much of Finland, and the Finns were not yet able to do so.
Because the people did not dare to go to eat, Panja offered free tasting.
This is how he taught the lads to eat thairfood, a spring roll at a time.
From countries to countries, "he said.
I left the Lakers hooked.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai restaurant in the Lahti trading hall.
There were two small tables, there would be fewer than 20 customer seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit beside a boat guest.
When you are hungry and places are limited, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and the guest.
Gradually we got better and became friends.
In the end, I sat in front of the board with a dictionary to learn about thaikal.
Two years went by the side of the shopping hall, but then the restaurant had to change because the self-made spices would reportedly smell too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the end of the trading hall.
There's room.
Now we jurors are allowed to sit at our own tables again, only in the most crowded times we will be shy to ask guests if there is room next door.
Panja knows his client.
He is told of the auditions that have taken place and who has been seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He has seen how the life stages of customers vary and the food club changes.
He remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring snakes.
He remembers me as depressed and obese, and remembers what I was like at a young age.
It is nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my own place beside the door of the kitchen and exchange alerts with Panja, who relies on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with a sweet child.
He has opened up not only our taste but also our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many people talk to him about the Thai - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panama.
While the wedding has been difficult, she is always friendly.
He's hard-working.
On top of the restaurant work, he goes in a mushroom and blacks.
Last week, the restaurant quietly celebrated two decades of fulfilment.
We customers got a strawberry cake for dessert.
Without distress or attention went on this remarkable day, at work.
Discovery of underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists ready to hit Europe
At the beginning of the year, the security authorities got their hands on an important list of counter-terrorism work.
The list includes data from more than 170 Isis fighters ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 people and the document includes not only their personal data, but also pictures of each.
More than 130 of the people mentioned in the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Evening-Sanomat reported on the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains have been specified.
According to the newspaper, Iraqi army special forces found a list of terrorists' personal data and images while investigating the terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence officials assessed the authenticity of the documents and sent them forward to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The background was the fear that something big and serious would be planned by terrorists in the West after the fall of Isis in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and images of all persons, but also their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the person's country of origin.
The list has also identified the specific areas of terrorism.
For example, in the case of the German 27-year-old Sami J., who is on the list, it says Abu Assid al-Almani, a German.
He reportedly left Germany in 2012, travelling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later via Turkey to Syria to join the ranks of Isis.
A special suicide bomber has been written beside his pictures.
There is no more precise information about the man's fate.
A total of around 6 000 fighters from Europe have left the ranks of Isis, whose fate is not certain.
Man sped beneath the surface at Helsinki's Tokoina beach
Based on interviews with the rescue team, the man had wanted to show that he was able to swim.
Smart cricket can save a drowning life.
A man trapped under water was rescued on Thursday at Helsinki's Tokoina beach.
According to Ville Estlander, a firefighter on duty at the Helsinki rescue facility, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found under water about 15 minutes after the announcement.
A diver from the rescue facility found him on the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue service received the announcement after half four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to the hands of primary care.
Estlander says it was about a 50-year-old man.
On the basis of the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he was able to swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander is thanking the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Patrol Service and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Patrol Service.
The locals also guided the divers brilliantly.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water along with the Border Patrol Service and police.
Two cars collided in Eura - nine people in cars, three seriously injured
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom received minor injuries, says an updated firefighter.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident happened at the intersection of three roads four times in the day.
The crash happened when another car turned into a warning triangle in front of another car, says an updated firefighter.
According to the rescue service, there is an 80-kilometre-per-hour speed limit at the intersection.
Brothers fight over $500 million property
Two brothers are arguing over Victoria's largest real estate empire worth more than $500 million - a dispute linked to a family business set up by their Italian family 40 years ago.
Former Carlton football club chairman and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in Toorak's value district just three houses away from his younger brother Paulista; the younger brother has taken to the Supreme Court over a dispute over the brothers' property and business property division.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute over the divorce.
The brothers and their mother Anna jointly own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars; the family began begging for the property when they bought a shop on Collingwood's Smith Street in 1973.
The family set up a Westco Jeans shop there, expanding into a chain of 160 stores.
The chain sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, and homes in the Gold Coast and Mt Bulls, as well as suburban shopping centres.
According to an agreement with the family's late father, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul about a third of the company's wealth; Paul describes his father as "the power and central character of the family."
According to court documents, the property-sharing relationship means Colin owns the property for about $316 million and Paul for about $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of property and money.
"I think Colin left the best real estate for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first jury testimony to justice in 2015.
The case was dealt with last Friday for the first time in the Supreme Court after several mediation attempts.
The brothers are now also arguing over who dominates the existing business; Paul claims Colin has ruled him out of business.
Colin says the claim is not true; he blames Paulia for the poor management of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first jury testimony that he would like to find a solution.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, the family is the most important to me," Colin says in a statement.
The cost of the case is constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of false statements, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consultants such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the country's best and most experienced lawyers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian migrants who set up milk bars and delicious shops in the late 1950s; in the early 1970s, they bought a shop in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral for the family's purchase of the Collingwood estate, to which Colin founded the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he founded the shop "in the final years of high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to move the estate to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often stated that he did not want the brothers to end up in court," Anna writes in a statement.
The family's two other sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group business; according to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million after leaving the company.
According to Pauli, Luke and Mark are "bitter about the financial terms of their departure."
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former Australian Football League club board member and television star Eddie McGuire's best friend, according to his 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Luton and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded, saying in a text message that it was not right to comment because it is being dealt with in court.
"It is with great sadness that my brother Paul has decided to take me to court and pull the name of our family into the legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to agree to his brother's claims.
"Our father would not have wanted us to languish in this way," Colin continued, telling him he still hoped to reach a settlement.
On Friday, the hope appeared to have been extinguished.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to Poltico magazine, the White House's new chief of staff plans to limit President Trump's media use and news monitoring to prevent the boss from getting into trouble so often.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reported:
"When the White House's new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with senior staff on his first day in office, he addressed a key problem he's going to solve: He's going to restrict access to information for President Donald Trump.
Kelly told White House employees that all information - both in print and in briefings - must go through him "because the president makes better decisions when you get good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television - and as president, he's still watching a lot of television.
"If presidential candidate Trump was nervous about unfair news coverage, it was worthwhile for him to show that sympathetic media handled things more fairly," Sam Nunberg, who worked as an adviser to Trump's campaign, told Politico in February.
Politico reporter Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "according to six former campaign employees, in managing Trump's use of Twitter, it is essential that his personal media flow includes a steady stream of praise."
OK.
But it's ridiculous to suggest that Trump's use of Twitter has ever been under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know - perhaps Trump's tweets without their efforts would have been even more hurtful.
We're probably never going to know what kind of messages Trump was left to send.
If even a few times his staff have been able to prevent him from causing problems, their work has not been in vain.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing a stir.
The problem is partly because there are competing factions in the White House trying to push their cause by giving Trump information that supports their view; that information can be reliable - or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers intentionally give the president questionable information.
Journalist Shane Goldmacher reported one incident:
"Trump's current and former employees say he can infuriate enormously from press outlets where he is criticized - especially if they report damaging leaks of information - then he's quite forced to know where the information came from.
That was the case at the end of February, when someone jokingly gave the president a copy of the news on GotNews.com, set up by online provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter because of harassment, and had previously spread false accusations and later recovered them; he also did not provide concrete evidence.
Despite that, Trump had started the story after reading a question to staff about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "had tried to introduce a management system of documents lost to Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly is trying the same three months later.
Perhaps he turns out to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump still has his own impulsive self and his aides are still pushing his own affairs.
These unaltered facts make Kelly's task extremely difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, reports news agency AFP.
Earlier on Thursday night it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a €222 million exit price for FC Barcelona, who played in the Spanish league.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona had therefore been demolished and he was free to move to Parisian club PSG.
The soaring €222 million transfer fee is the biggest in football history.
Previously, the record was for Manchester United, who paid €105 million last summer from Frenchman Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by state-owned qatari company Qatar Sports Investments.
The club is chaired by a former tennis professional, qatarian Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is believed to have arrived in Paris on Friday.
Successful author Raija Oranen exclaimed with the hypnosis of alcoholism and flight fear: "I'm in the shape of my life"
On the TV series Ruusu's time and Puhtaa's white lawn, the well-known successful writer Raija Oranen celebrated just his 69-year anniversary.
Hypnosis helped Raiya Orasta.
Five grandchildren keep mums in such a grip, along with writing that Sarah and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winter months.
First they sold their house, but now there was also a rental apartment in the spring.
In light and sun, away from the old circles, Raiyan once took the depression and alcoholism from which he survived.
The external nature is also 20 kg lighter.
The weight was left to fall when serotonin drugs were stopped, they were mood medication.
I got help with alcoholism at the time from hypnosis, which also led to flight fear, I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a man, the radiant writer says candidly.
Sarah and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for more than 45 years.
I can better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen, who has worked in the rail and tourism sector, has been travelling together for more than 40 years.
I Kos, and it was getting married in two weeks, "Raija said with a laugh.
That's the kind of drama the Queen has always been, finished her life from that, "Jyrki said with a laugh to his wife.
Oranen, who made a major writer's career, remembers only a good 44-part Puhtaat white-clad TV series that touched and moved to depressed Finland.
I decided, once and for all, to have a beloved family company in the clothing industry when I read a 50-year interview with Liisa Seppänen on the plane.
I was the daughter of a homeowner myself, my mother also had a clothing business and sometimes worked as a mannequin, "Orange remembered.
For him, a series of plot and story changed the attitude of Finns to entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and claim it revealed, Oranen says.
Sarah Oranen lives as a writer for an active time, she has many manuscripts under work - ideas for hundreds.
Itineraries returned to oja over 'billion'
Homeowners among the wealthiest in the West Midlands are back in support with persistent itineraries who managed to cross the municipality's loudspeaker and return to a field adjacent to the houses.
The itineraries were parking a couple of caravans on a mile-long street near Solihulli.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to overcome the power of the municipality's procession, bringing with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The itineraries managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected because of the knee.
Furious residents have accused the Solihulli municipality of a "total inability to solve the problem."
The unnamed resident says the itineraries came on Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown passers-by with stones.
"The municipality must be persuaded to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The itineraries were here in May, then they went away but returned again.
There were more of them in the evening and probably even more today. "
The resident told the court the Birmingham municipality had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
'i live on Streetsbrook Road and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality is unable to do anything about it.'
According to another unnamed resident, it is ridiculous that the itineraries returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them in the past, and they've even dropped a horse to graze into the park." "
A spokesman for Solihulli municipality said the municipality is aware of an illegal camp near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with Solihulli police to evict the camp officers as soon as possible.
From the point of view of gathering evidence, it is vital that as many local people as possible report disruptive or criminal activity to the police.
It will help to provide an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings. "
Furious people besieged by Portuguese tourist plane
Men on a beach packed with people in Portugal have been questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the blast.
Two men flying the machine can be charged with causing death.
The longest sentence could be 16 years in prison in Portugal.
Yesterday, due to a technical fault, a small plane flying by men had to make a landing on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the event, some of whom ran into the landing machine to escape into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane first hit the man, who was in the back of the plane.
Soon after, the plane rose upwards and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, reported the beach's Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not injured.
The beach-goers besieged the small plane immediately after the crash in anger.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and began to smell the truth of it, reported Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It is a miracle that no more people died.
The two men who were on the plane were not injured in the blast.
The Finnish star, who tragically lost his leg, once again won World Cup gold: "Without accident I would not be a world champion"
In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Matti Greater Hamari celebrated Finland's time with a World Cup gold banked slalom in the competition at Canada's Big Whiteside.
Earlier in the Games, Greater Hamari also won the Cross Cup gold.
All in all, there have already been three World Cup qualifiers.
Pretty incredible World Cup!
Twice treated with gold, a pretty good heart is drawn, the phone reaching Greater Hamari delights.
The 30-year-old teller thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Greater Hamar, the number of contenders in the species is growing all the time.
The whole area of snowboarding has grown and developed very much in recent times.
The differences are getting smaller and there are a lot of new tellers involved.
Always consider whether there is going to be a black horse.
Every contest feels like a different winner.
Greater Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had fallen enthusiastically from a young age with his friends, and the accident did not take away the desire to get to the slopes.
It comes to mind from time to time what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that there is no need for ifs.
Those cards play what is shared, Greater Hamari insists.
It would be cruel to describe a serious accident and the loss of a limb as a stroke of luck, and that is not what Greater Hamari is doing.
But he turned the gruesome difficulty to his advantage.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned out to be a victory.
I would not be a triple world champion without an accident.
Prior to the incident, the 23-year-old Greater Hamar's biggest board was already fading.
The oven towards the top went off in earnest only after the accident.
Treenas at a young age with friends, and we were always thrilled with X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dimmed somewhat over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself out there from the X-Games starter.
I could not have imagined beforehand.
I was 23 years old and thought this was going to be a really long life if I stayed here to be bitten and mourned.
I decided to pull the painters in the neck and start to work.
I would say I've managed pretty well.
The teller was delighted with the choice of wheelchair player Leo-Pekka Star as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic winner received her award at a sports gala in January.
According to Greater Hamar, the victory of the Star is an important signal for the parade sport.
It was a really big deal and the victory was definitely deserved.
This will certainly also open the eyes to the parade sports world.
When is it time to launch double world champion Matti Greater Hamar's athletic campaign of the year?
It will then be seen in due course.
I try to do my best to succeed.
Still, Greater Hamari has not conquered all of its luscious champions.
Next year there will be a big goal.
In a year's time, the Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
Yes, from there you go to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugee young people do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country
A Voice for Young Syrian Refuges study explored the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees slapping bread at a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of young people in Syria do not believe that they will return to their country of origin permanently.
According to them, the end of the war in Syria and the departure of Isis from the country are the most important things that should happen to allow them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seen to bring change to the Syrian conflict.
Communications office chain Burson-Marsteller explained the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
For nine years, Burson-Marsteller has studied the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth.
This year's A Voice for Young Syrian Refuges study explored the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Between February and March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian young people aged between 18 and 24, half of whom are women and half men, responded to the study.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
Forty-two per cent of respondents may think of returning to their home country and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, young people's decision to return home is most influenced by the ongoing war in Syria, as well as the presence of Isis in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most important factor for permanent return, while a quarter believe that the most important thing would be for Isis to leave the country.
Just under a tenth elevates the most important decision-making factors to an improvement in the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict
Syrian youths were asked what factor is most important for ending the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more essential than the removal of President Bashar al-Assad from power.
A fair quarter sees Assad's presidency as an obstacle to a peace deal.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the current conflict in Syria.
In order to resolve the conflict by means of military action alone, we do not believe that there is a fair quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugee youth see Isis's power weakened over the past year, while a fifth feel its power strengthened.
According to the defendants, the most important thing in the fight against the Islanders, and terrorism in general, is for the media to inform people that Isis has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many people made military measures and education reform a priority.
For a fair tenth, the most important thing would be to create better paid jobs for young people.
Asked about the impact of Trump's administration on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe the conflict will not change under Trump's administration.
Nearly one in four believe the Syrian conflict will worsen under Trump.
Opinions are divided on whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding to keep the net in order - the database he developed is used by, for example, Wikipedia and Google
Liverpool-based company MariaDB is developing the "world's fastest growing" open-source database.
The main product of MariaDB, set up by dog entrepreneur Michael 'Monty' Widenius, costs users absolutely nothing and can be developed via the internet by any eminent programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge amounts of data remain in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedines, Twitter or Booking.com., they use a database of MariaDB or MySQL.
"All information that is not in visual form comes from the database and the images are lined up there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, who works as a technology director at MariaDB, spends about half his time coding.
A man working remotely from the street will play his part in ensuring that the internet functions smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open-source database, MySQL, along with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, technology company Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later software giant Oracle hid the Suns for $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle transaction took place, much of MySQL's developers announced they were leaving.
"They didn't want to work for Oraclan, who didn't give a definite promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius remembered.
Already at this stage, he had set up a company that started developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life work to die.
I hired twenty of the best developers on Sundays and thus ensured that the continuity of the code was secured by the same friends who created it.
Because MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch of it.
The name just had to be changed.
A foundation was set up to monitor the freedom of development of the MariaDB code.
"During MySQL, these assurances were not made," Widenius lamented.
While many people have heard about Widenius and MySQL's billions, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"In recent years, our growth rate has been around 50 percent a year," says Kenneth Paqvalé, economic director of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not making a profit yet, and Paqvalé is scarce on the company's hallmark figures.
To that extent, he reveals that in the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that it will receive €20 million in orders.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps change databases, which can be more than a year's career if a customer has used a closed database.
The exchange from MySQL to MariaDB is successful in an instant because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, Spanish operator Telefónica and Southeast Asia's largest bank, DBS, are paying customers for MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud, offer customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in the distribution packages of Linux operating systems, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we are a small firm, we have links to the biggest gamblers.
"Among our customers are the world's largest telecoms operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central bank," Paqvalé lists.
The data market is still dominated by giants such as Oraclen, Microsoft, IBM and SAP in their closed databases.
Oraclellek's MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although, according to research company Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, players like MariaDB are still smitten, though fast-growing blue.
With about $50 billion in the database market, open-source databases don't reach even a billion.
However, the weight of open source cannot be measured only in money, because the majority of users do not pay anything for these software.
Research company Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will already develop more than 70 percent of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would then have been switched to open or the transition would at least have begun.
Big companies don't get new customers because most choose the next open source.
This has led to a jump in licence fees for commercial databases.
Companies want to make as much money as they did in the past with a smaller number of customers, "Widenius thinks.
Since switching to a closed database is cumbersome, the majority of customer companies have swallowed up the price increases in an abiding way.
"There are a lot of customers for whom the transition is really difficult because their old applications and others are in a closed database," Widenius says.
He still believes that the measure of customers is becoming full.
When licence fees rise each year, the customer will sooner or later switch to an open source database.
The price is 10-20% from the previous one, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if they so wish.
Moreover, many companies are already facing major systemic changes when they transfer their operations to cloud computing.
At the same time, many people change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million in loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has about 115 employees worldwide and now plans to hire more.
One of the reasons for EIB's funding was the impact of MariaDB on public procurement.
The company has public sector customers in countries such as Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros annually from databases.
"A lot of countries want to move to open-source solutions and thus use tax money more efficiently," Paqvalén says.
Widenius regrets how money is being wasted in Finland, for example on closed healthcare systems, when open systems are cheaper, and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some people say open source code is an ideology, but I think it's a better way to make code.
The Community helps and does something that is not invented or able to do itself.
The 55-year-old Widenius is one of the best-known open-source promoters, along with another Finnish, Linux developer Linus Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies develop viable business models on the open source.
I still hold 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this subject.
Italy takes tougher stance on NGO rescue vessels
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations that rescue refugees from their boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue unless they undertake to comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs don't commit to a new code of conduct, it's hard to see how they could continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the townhouse La Stampa newspaper.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities had seized a ship from the German aid organisation Jugend Rhett, whose crew is suspected of working with smugglers to promote illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has been operating for just a year, declined to comment on the detailed charges against prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing; we are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization announced in a statement published on social media.
"We can only assess the accusations once we have compiled all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa vessel of the Jugend Rhett since October.
The crew is suspected of taking refugees by boat directly from human smugglers who were able to re-access the boats.
One such incident is alleged to have occurred just a couple of kilometres from the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's document published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian coastguard, which monitors rescue operations in the area.
According to the code of conduct, vessels such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police force to oversee the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the operating instructions: Save the Children and Maltese MOAS, as well as the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
Trump announced Thursday that he considers the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they do not pose "significant changes or obstacles" to the organization's rescue efforts.
Among those who have refused to comply with the code of conduct is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Médecins sans Frontières.
Minniti, for his part, said that with rescue efforts, the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which he sees as evidence that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors are starting to deliver.
"The last few days have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed plans to resume talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of killing his unmarried partner in Enontekiö, suspect found in terrain - case to prosecutor
The suspected crime took place in Enontekiö Kuttas last December.
Police say a 36-year-old man from the Czech Republic is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish unmarried partner.
It has previously been reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police have also reported that the suspect, after his actions, would have fled with two dogs to the terrain.
The man was found stabbed on the ground and did not resist when caught.
The charge in the case must be raised within a week.
The case may still be filed in the District Court of Lapland in the course of August.
Robert Hardy, known for his Harry Potter and all-black friend series, has died
British actor Robert Hardy has died aged 91.
The actor's death was announced Thursday by this family.
Born in 1925, Hardy started his actress corner at the age of 24 at the theatre.
During his long career, he also appeared in films and television shows.
Hardy will be remembered in particular for the role of magician Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films, as well as for his veterinary role in an all-black friend's television series based on James Heriot's book.
The BBC's popular series was filmed for a total of seven seasons.
Michelle Carter sentenced to prison for text messages inciting suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for text messages and phone calls in which she was seen inciting her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years in probation.
Carter was convicted in June of manslaughter; her boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said during Thursday's session.
'My son was my best friend.'
Carter applied for a conviction and was allowed to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was threatened with a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffered mental health problems.
Dressed in a pair of red trousers and a cream-coloured bag, Carter listened to his judge's hands with a crying look at the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act, "the prosecutor continued.
'She didn't show up on the street.
According to Carter's lawyer, the incident was due to "shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
But Judge Lawrence Moniz ruled that Carter's "age or maturity and not even mental health problems had a significant impact on his actions."
The prosecutor read a statement from Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, in which the mother told the inquest: 'It wouldn't take a day for me not to mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I cope with all of this. I will try my best to comfort her sisters in this pain we will always bear. "
CONRAD's sister, Camdyn Roy, told the court she was "persecuted" by the idea that she would never see her brother's wedding or be an aunt to her children.
"It's painful to lose a person who has been in my life every day since my birth; that pain will never relax," Camdyn said.
The case appears to set a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car in a cage poisoning dead in 2014.
The case attracted nationwide attention when it emerged that Carter had texted her boyfriend to commit suicide.
I don't know, there are many ways, "Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent to Royce during the two weeks leading up to this death. Roy was on holiday with his family at the time.
Just a little before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to launch a generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention in Roy's death; the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of experts.
Few have defended Carter; one of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of her British classmate in Italy in 2007, who was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published a Knox poll, saying: "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary-General: Snaps on Russia worst since Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated markedly, commented NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, "Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability in Russia's eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO remains committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not escalate to their peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid further escalation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump tweeted that the US-Russia rift had reached even dangerously bad levels.
Trump urged praise for the countries' bad relations with Congress, which passed new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi makes changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to setback experienced by car manufacturers
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to update the software of more than 350,000 cars.
The head of BMW said the company believes "there are more reasonable options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities, including BMW's home city of Munich, which are considering limiting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday it would make changes to the engines of more than three million Mercedes to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke about the invitation.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to meet CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are thought to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing devices that neutralize emissions will rise, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German carmakers are under intense scrutiny, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of accommodations by big car companies and ignoring problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes; Volkswagen installed cheating devices in cars that reduced emissions to comply with regulations in tests; in ordinary driving, emissions were higher.
Charges have been filed against several Volkswagen executives in the United States, but the leaders' actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the Audi engine development department in charge of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
ZACCHEO Giovanni Pamio is Italian so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen; authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars to circumvent European emissions standards; the charge was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The Audi investigation could significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: The luxury car maker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
Venezuela's vote began with a flurry of protests, big protests
According to the company, the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a firm that has no role in the election result, National Election Commission Chairman Tibisay Lucenan told reporters.
Maduro confirms end of crisis
In a controversial vote in Venezuela on Sunday, an assembly was elected to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organized protests against its change.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be under way at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais, the country's national security forces began local time on Wednesday night to take over the country's parliament building.
The force is supposed to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Laventent has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France but is now threatened by climate change.
Laventeli had declined due to drought and disease-borne insects, with scientists and farmers feverishly trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Laventeli is downright endangered in Provence because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years, with a marked reduction in rainfall in the spring and especially in autumn," says Eric Chaisse, an agriculture specialist.
"This shortens the lifetime of the lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought a lot of small piles to the region, spreading microbacteria. "
The stakes are tough.
Laventelioil attracts tourists and is also a highly desired ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of long stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or completely missing," Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer parts containing meteer oil."
The solution is sought by intensifying irrigation, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying plants with a protective mix of rain and water, as well as developing more sustainable varieties of drought.
Journalist's murder reflects growing threat in Mexico
The delivery of Riodoce, which appears once a week, usually meets on Wednesday to discuss how the newspaper deals with the most recent cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and an endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing security in the light of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: Leave the children home or involve them in the delivery, which was struck by a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard in the front of the room: Opponents, neutral, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group. No evidence is needed, observations and feelings are sufficient.
The table writes the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on the pay lists of the government or drug cartels, who are criminals who make the chaos in Mexico life-threatening.
According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012.
The latest victims include Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, a journalist and source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed, even though he is present everywhere.
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez's death, with reporters discussing their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia over their fears.
A federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 specifically for handling cases of journalists, but only two charges have been filed so far, according to the Reporters' Protection Committee.
The murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice, as are the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, few end up in court.
Riodoce's journalists plan to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are in mourning and the situation is even more dangerous.
Ibarra says there is little benefit from the security meeting because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is frankly a waste of time," he says.
'We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the cause of the event.'
Valdez had left Riodoce's delivery in the state capital, Culiacan, on the morning of May 15, 2017.
He had been driving in a red Toyota just a couple of blocks away when he was stopped by two men and forced out of his car and fired twelve shots, presumably linked to the magazine's name: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove away from Valdez's car and knocked it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was survived by a grieving wife and two adult children.
The rumours move quickly and run freely in Culiacan.
But there is a weird silence about Valdez's death.
Sinaloa has been one of Mexico's bloodiest battlefields since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January; rival factions want to fill the void.
On the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot dead on a daily basis, and the cemetery has drug barons decorating two-storey burial buildings larger than many homes.
The coastal state is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
While Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a rival faction waging war against Guzman's sons.
The story may have angered Guzman's sons: Customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every number of the magazine as soon as the magazine came to the outlets.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career at Noroestee when, in 2003, he decided to set up a Riodoce with five colleagues; the magazine's shares were then sold for $50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without addressing the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to feel its bold and honest stuff, and its sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing high-class investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by articles in the magazine that no one else dared publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for his coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Prize from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage to follow the story of Mexican drug trafficking relentlessly.
He openly admitted he was afraid.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said after receiving an award from the journalists "conservation committee.
Drug trafficking is a "way of life in Sinaloa," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
'a reporter has to take on the role that falls on him - or play stupid.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was sown here - why didn't I tell you what was going on? '
The staff at Riodoce need Valdez - a jogger who cursed like a dockers worker; they miss a friend who was always given a hug and advice; they miss a teacher who knew how to cope.
They trusted his routine.
He was always wearing a panda hat.
He went to the delivery counter at the El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they are asking if the routine caused his fate.
The death of a colleague has also led them to consider how best to do their job and stay alive.
"Criminals don't like it if we deal with our stories about their women and children and their clean business, their secret drug-trafficking runways.
They were left out of the stories, "Bojorquez says.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection,
Relying on your own instincts.
If you feel that everything is not right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Riodoce journalist Andres Villarreal, is that "the impression can fail, and that's what happened with Javier."
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: Attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce's security training was held; a few days earlier, it had emerged that only spyware sold to governments had followed activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had been looking for a tree in the shadow of the shelter from a 40-degree helmet.
The state government had ordered them to patrol Riodoce's premises in a four-storey building in the middle-class Culiacan district.
Some of the journalists were half joking about whether the two police officers were among the 50% that the governor of the state did not consider to be reliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited a mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's number, Riodoce's delivery planned three main jumps.
Boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez's brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The magazine also intended to reveal that government spending had focused on the governor's home town.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block away from the prosecutor's office, had kidnapped a group of people.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to tread carefully: Everyone in the city knew the restaurant was in favour of both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist discovered in public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for nearly a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about previous cases in the same place; in one of them, "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have been known to receive reliable information from Valdez's columnist about the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have already known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been given the nickname "El Flaco" due to his hooky body structure.
"Now all contacts with our sources of information are broken."
Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse that maintains signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists; the magazine's employees have been given a new, unexpected task: They have become activists for the freedom of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs after leaving the local prosecutor's office the next morning to protest yet another journalist's murder.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez's murder.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found which, according to DNA tests carried out by authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest more loudly across the country, with "SOS Press" texts appearing on the pavements and buildings.
Today, leader Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to gain international support for the investigation into the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused authorities of spying and killing journalists because they tell the truth.
He has since requested that he be moved out of government-related cases because he is concerned that he will not be able to be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, crime-permitting authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narcojournalism, Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the behest of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Articulo 19 monitoring group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by police and authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murder has a crippling effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was accompanied by a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I am here because of my spelling."
Next to his cut head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to close, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern Chihuahua border state after the March murder of correspondent Miroslava Breachi.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredo in El Manana, although its leader was assassinated in 2004.
In 2010, on his front page, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to drug cartels: "What do you want from us?"
Some of the journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
It is a difficult decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and all the time you have to be wary.
Sometimes criminals search for a reporter, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra - who was once supposed to become a poet - admits that writing about drug trafficking is frightening.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Not long ago, reporters in Riodoce sat in front of the delivery on Friday night with a foot-long beer when the magazine's newest number was completed; suddenly, their phones began to colour as a sign of the message.
19 people had been killed in a shooting between rival gangs and security forces at a beach resort in Mazatland.
The war intensified, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Reporters put the news on Riodoce's website on foot on their smartphones.
The front page had to be rewritten the next day.
The siren extended nearby - yet another shooting scene.
Bojorquez flashed the police officers guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's delivery continued the tradition of the magazine's murdered founder under this massive portrait of a man showing a middle finger across Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says you can't even consider ending the action. "How could I close the magazine when our trainee asked to get to the street to do a run on the same day that Javier had been murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge setback - "Kova place"
In April, 39-year-old Hannity Manninen's celebrations fell short as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
But there was a catastrophic start to the training season when Manninen fell ill with the flu.
It began a long period of illness that stretched to nearly five weeks.
In practice, May went completely ill.
First there was the flu and, finally, a child's disease such as ear infection, to which I had to eat an antibiotic.
I was able to do only 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember when I've last been around for a long time.
It was a tough place when I didn't get used to training, "Manninen tells Ista-Sanomaa.
Test results collapsed
The 2007 world champion only received a training permit in the second week of June, which was reflected in the 12 June race and top-flight sports research centre KIHU's rollercoaster test.
In the test, the athlete skips on a roller coaster on the ground, whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about 10 seconds, and the tester takes the athlete's finger with a needle in a lactic acid sample.
Last autumn I sat on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed for 28 minutes.
Came against the wall, "Manninen says.
For the better
After the initial difficulties, Manninen tells her to stay healthy.
I've done a variety of calm aerobic exercises to normalize my body's metabolism.
Now we have a really good five-week period behind us.
The celebration also included a one-and-a-half week holiday from Airbnb.
I also had time to visit the cottage with my family.
Last season, Manninen took part in just four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was seen immediately in the opening race when Manninen emerged as the top instructor at 18.
Guidelines withdrawn
Manninen and the national team's head coach, Petter Kukkonen, have carried out a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm in training compared to last season.
After the first snow championships, Ruka would have a weekend of three World Cup qualifiers.
In December, the intention would be to play at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsay.
At the end of January, there would still be plans to participate in Seefeld.
Hopefully then the name will be found on the Olympic team's list, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be the sixth Winter Olympics in Manninen's career.
The most important thing now is to stay healthy, the nummelic alleyway celebrated in Salt Lake City's 2002 gold team competition.
Dinosaur protected from enemy by camouflage
At first, it looks like a frightening statue.
Now scientists have revealed the first findings of a species of rhinoceros discovered by a Canadian miner that was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that scientists were even able to determine that its sugary skin was red-brown and had had a "problematic past."
According to Current Biology, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur of all time and representatives of the world's best species.
The recently discovered fossil is nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the bonfire season between 110 and 112 million years ago.
Scientists view this amazingly well-preserved fossil as a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic, the armoured vegetarian is the best preserved fossil of all time.
It was found at the Suncor Millenium mine in Canada's northern Alberta on 21 March 2011 and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding skull and decided to study his discovery more closely.
The fossil found on the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum in Tyrrell.
There, the fray was excavated for six years for 1,100 kilograms of salmon.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
"If you cross your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrell.
"It will go down in the history of science as the Mona list of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Naha's studies found that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely to pose a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had a tank and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armour was masked by its predators, and it was also shielded by a darker and less pink colour, which is still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to confuse its surroundings and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Paleontological Museum in Tyrrell.
Scientists have given it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli, according to museum technician Mark Mitchell, who was part of a team that took more than 7,000 hours to dig up the dinosaur.
The Nodosaurus has been preserved so amazingly well that Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by general coloring, in which the body is darker and lighter.
Still, the finding was a surprise because Borealopta is significantly larger than current animals with similar coloring.
It can be concluded that the dinosaurs who eat meat caught it to such an extent that evolution favoured hiding instead of fighting as a means of survival.
They are significantly smaller and therefore easier to catch, which suggests that nodosaurs were also seriously threatened.
"The catch of a large, heavily armoured dinosaur tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs of the bonfire season were," Brown says.
A chemical analysis of organic compounds in Nodosaurs reveals that its leather was red-brown.
Scientists continue to study nodosaurs to draw conclusions about its life; they study, among other things, the contents of its mouth to find out what it ate in its last meal.
Investigators believe it crashed into the river and ran into the sea, where it sank wide to the seabed.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is today in Florida, and rivers and seas were likely to extend much further than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because its suede leather has been preserved and has also been preserved three-dimensional in its original form," Brown says.
'That's why it looks almost the same as in the early meat season
Framing it doesn't require much imagination: If you sip a little silk, you can almost believe it was sleep.'
The meat season was an era of teropods, huge two-legged, flesh-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years in Borealopelta before, its powerful predecessors may have caught this armoured dinosaur.
The predecessors of the Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, a six-year-old monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings from Nodosaurs researchers have been published in the journal Current Biology, who believe that Borealopa washed up in the sea after his death and migrated to his mum.
It was found at the Suncor Millenium mine in Canada's northern Alberta on 21 March 2011 and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, with its skins and tanks hooked to the hip.
Nodosaurs were on average five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
Two half-hearted snippets were raised from their laps.
Investigators believe this armoured vegetarian passed through the current western Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armour has been preserved in small detail in an undersea grave.
Its fossilized remains have been preserved so well that its leather remains are left in armour-shaped discs across its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such survival is "as rare as a lottery victory.
The closer you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
There is still fossilized leather in its skull-shaped discs.
Its right front foot is in its bath, five inches upwards.
I will also be able to calculate the size of its foot base. "
How did an activist learn to answer the question: Who do the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply upset on 9 August 2014.
He had arrived a day earlier in New York from his home in St. Louis and sat on the bed of his airbnb apartment browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high school friends:
"Police just killed an 18-year-old young man and his body is still on the street," the statement said.
Confused, he noted that no one else had posted the same information on his feed, which is why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline included numerous retweets from user @ TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to a St. Louis resident who tweeted in real time about the death of Michael Brown, a white police officer who had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
That user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is unbelievable," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away; when he returned to Twitter later that evening, it was reported people gathered on Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police badges and shouting people, as well as Brown's father-in-law's self-claiming man, whose placard read: 'Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!'
Ferrell watched a real-time video in which police stood in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He says he also saw a video in which another police officer grabbed his rifle and shouted: "I will kill all of you... animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrell remembers verifying.
'It wasn't the kind of murder we're already used to and could be said to be typical.
Then I felt cold colours.
I was angry and wept. ""
He booked a return flight home the next day.
The plane landed on the 11th night; Ferrell went to retrieve his six-year-old daughter from his father's trust and decided they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
From what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next nearly three years, the documentary film "Whose Streets?" Got its first night in cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and emotion, love and loss, and strength and resilience from the perspective of the local people who took to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson in a flower box and with his daughter dressed in a matching crown, they had a renewed conversation about "what it is like to live in black and under what conditions."
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things you believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
'We're going to Ferguson because an 18-year-old boy was killed by police and that's not right.'
"I could not take my daughter with me," Ferrell later told her.
"Today's events are... the culmination of the events of the past.
My daughter has the right to know it and grow into it.
He needs to have the capacity for activism and organization, but he also needs to know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living in black, and he needs to know what we need to do to free ourselves, to liberate ourselves.
Although fortunately I have been able to protect her from blatant racism, she is still similar to other black girls.
I feel like I would hurt him if I protected him from reality.'
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, located opposite the police station, which became a camp for activists waiting for information about the handling of the case and eventually learned that no charges would be brought against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They pack lunches in bags and distribute them to protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to approach activism in a new way.
"The activism changed completely after August 9," he says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was president of an organization of nursing students belonging to minorities.
"I had no experience of organizing.
Somehow it just happened.'
Weeks later, Ferrell met at an evening demonstration with Sabaah Folayan, the documentary's deputy director.
Folayan said he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "simply wanted to tell" what was happening.
There was a doubt in Ferrell's mind; he asked, "Do you really want to tell what's happening, or do you want a story you can take advantage of?"
The suspicion was driven by the countless times that people had appeared in the local community, usually white, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and grew up in Ferguson had no common voice," Folayan said in a recent interview, "we wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted deputy director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism on death row inmates.
Davis's involvement prompted Ferrell to join the project along with six other locals; the filming team followed events in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This is not a documentary where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, we talk," Davis says.
"The most important thing for me was how local people are portrayed in the film because I'm presented in the same way." "
According to Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experience because there was a desire to show that the popular movement "is not about a charismatic leader but about the community."
That is why the documentary sees surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as love and marriage.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell said with a laugh, explaining what it felt like to see the film for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human depiction of black people require a certain vulnerability."
And Ferrell's story time and again brings to the centre the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
The move was sparked on social media by # BlackLivesMatter after police fired black teen boy Trayvon Martin in 2012, two of the movement's three founders identify with queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything.'
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed maintained by black women, among whom there are a lot of queer women."
But he insists that Ferrell was not selected for the documentary "self-intentionally" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folayan says.
'But it's no coincidence that she was on the front line; black queer women live at the cutting point of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is conveyed by a white supremacist. ""
News filming groups have left Ferguson a long time ago, but tensions between the community and police remain strained.
Ferrell still has two-and-a-half years of probation left; he was convicted of blocking a highway during a demonstration.
His description of the social political climate in his home country is short and succinct: "A mess."
Yet he still relies on the slogan he learned outside the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
'It's our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our shackles. "
Fitting integration: Artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman gallery in New York has been hung in the middle of an exhibition space in the face - white, black and brown faces, between which, to be more precise, you can detect a single sight.
The 30 works are portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's posture and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where he completed his 35-year sentence; Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on 2 August 2017.
It is driven by two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning; Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work; Manning is a transgender and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence was reduced.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA in an algorithm and created 30 portraits based on his genes - a sharp, if slightly theoretical, position on the shapes of DNA data, ambiguity and the underlying causality of interpretation.
Chelsea Manning, the birth name Bradley Edward, has openly told of her identification with women since puberty; she was found guilty in 2013 of 20 offences including espionage offences, computer fraud and theft.
Manning, who was sentenced to prison, had just one picture: A raunchy, black-and-white selfie in which a embarrassed-looking Manning sits in a car in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum
Dewey-Hagborg had a high-popularity Stranger Vision project in 2015, which he carried out in 2012.
In it, he created portraits on the basis of forensic data; he obtained DNA from, for example, tobacco shakes and pumpkins, and created images of what the people involved might have looked like.
The artist then received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their chat," Dewey-Hagborg told a briefing for the new exhibition.
Manning was unable to visit and could not be described in prison, so the magazine contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in making Manning a DNA portrait.
They wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even worked together on a suppressed Images comic book, imagined by Shoili Kanungo, describing a future in which the president would have softened Chelsea's judgment and would get to watch the exhibition.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning's sentence just a few days after the publication of the comic book, a happy coincidence after seven tough years spent in the nation's military prison.
It's also impressive that the exhibition is opening right now, with Donald Trump waging his own war against information leaks and transgender soldiers, and tweeting on Twitter more and more ways to reinforce the powerful divisions he had to actually mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes "everything has a purpose."
In a statement, the artist calls for an end to the "automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based."
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA section: A long sequence of C-, G- and A-letters written in the lead pen.
With this 200 letter - or nukleotid, as the scientific definition used by the artist reads - the combination Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least in our biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal to our genome and that gene information is very personal and open to interpretation," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"DNA tells countless stories. Here are 30 of them."
The last work of the exhibition is in its own room: A comic book by Sage Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
In it, Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they get you quiet, they've won," the picture reads.
"Don't be silent ever." "
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," the artist from Philadelphia says.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold colours." "
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has yet to see the exhibition; when Manning comes in, she is greeted by faces based on her own genes as a crowd of protesters in the middle of the exhibition room.
It's deliberate, like everything else in this exhibition: For example, Manning's DNA period is written with a lead pen to a height equal to his length (157.5 cm).
"The face was on the wall before, but I wanted to bring a crowd of people to them," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to describe the mass movement created by Chelsea, which was also behind his release," the statement read.
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee are being sought on suspicion of murder
Police say they have launched nationwide searches to find a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a chicagolic luxury apartment.
Cook County court documents show that arrest warrants were issued Monday for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local release released by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Police at the Grand Plaza apartment building found the victim with multiple stab wounds to his body.
According to authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and a wooden cot is being investigated for murder; police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, a bankruptcy lawyer in charge of social relations at the university, said in a statement sent by email that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is a criminal matter that authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
In an email, a spokesman for the university and Somerville College said: "We have been in contact with police in Britain and are ready to assist the authorities investigating the incident in the United States in every possible way."
The statement also reported that Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope he will surrender.
Chicago Police Information Officer Anthony Guglielmi said he is urging the suspects to seriously surrender to authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts and we are constantly clarifying our searches," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are helping in the search for suspects.
He told police he received a call from the host of the Grand Plaza, who had received a vague hint that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
Police described the scene at the scene as horrific.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim had been murdered the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi says.
Grand Plaza's management team released the following statement to residents: "Police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
Man threatened to blow up Islamic bookshop and 'kill Muslims' in London
"I am not anti-Muslim, I am Catholic," the convict told police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of his threats to blow up an Islamic bookshop in London and "kill all Muslims."
According to The Independent, David Moffatt was convicted, among other things, of gross harassment.
According to police, bookshop staff alerted them to the scene on May 23.
Staff said the man had "threatened to blow up the bookshop and kill Muslims."
The suspect left the shop after threats.
Moffatt was caught when he phoned police about the threat.
The intimidation was not related to the events at the bookshop.
Authorities found that Moffatt was wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the bookshop incident, a police spokesman said.
I am not anti-Muslim, I am Catholic, "Moffatt told police during questioning.
As a punishment, a man must carry out 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay legal costs of £620, or around €690, and compensation of £85, or around €95, to the victims.
A spokesman for Scotland Yard said several hate crimes are being left unreported.
"We will complete the actions under the WADA road map in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said Russia will soon take steps under the World Anti-Doping Agency's WADA roadmap to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission, RUSADA.
"Some of the measures under the road map have already been taken and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Commission," UKAD said.
WADA's road map has been updated in these respects, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for restoring the mandate of RUSADA, the second part of which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything of concern to Russia.
'Everything has been announced and everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future, "Mutko added.
But one of the points in the road map requires Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the findings of an investigation by WADA-imposed, Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who is investigating the state's alleged involvement in doping in Russian sport.
To which Mutko said: "The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All the measures have been taken.
There were no state programs and we can't admit something that didn't exist. ""
Mutko's words had echoes of the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, president of Russia's independent public anti-doping commission.
Earlier in the day, Smirnov, speaking to Russian RSport sports media, admitted there had been problems with Russian anti-doping agencies: "We have said several times that there are controversial positions and regulations in the report.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally, "he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to end doping control in Russia in November 2015 after the extent of the doping scandal was revealed.
But it received permission last June to design and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA director Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow in July, after a visit he said the organisation was "on the right track" towards restoring powers.
British organisation sceptical of Finns' love for innovation: There is' no evidence 'of health benefits of maternity packaging
A British organisation has doubts about the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packaging.
Among other things, the BBC and the Guardian report that the Lullaby Trust, which is fighting hidden deaths, prohibits the use of its own brochures in maternity packages distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, too, packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that maternity packaging reduces the risk of hidden death.
Hand death means the unexplained sudden death of a baby.
The Lullaby Trust works as an expert in British health authorities in the area of a child's safe sleep.
We are no longer allowed to pack our official brochures on them because it would suggest that we recommend this product, the organization reported.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, only two deaths per 1,000 births.
According to the Lullaby Trust, good reading in Finland is the result of a variety of reasons, such as the low number of teaspoons.
Giving each family a box might be a factor.
But that can't be said for sure, Lullaby Trust chief executive Francine Bates said.
We are concerned that maternity packaging is being marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and hidden deaths.
Maternity packaging is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers in Finland for free for 80 years.
The packaging contains a variety of items, including baby clothes.
This year, there are 53 products in the pack.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box on which the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, its distributed boxes meet all safety standards.
The Lullaby Trust, for its part, says there is no safety standard for sleeping in cardboard boxes.
According to the Lullaby Trust, packaging can be the best option for a sleeping place if you don't have a towel or a superficial bed.
The organization recommends using the packaging only for a day's sleep and stop using it when the child is able to turn around.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the pack and making sure it's not piled or dirty.
Vikkelä villain jailed for second time at Japanese zoo
Staff at a Japanese zoo are searching for a carved tortoise.
The giant tortoise has surprised staff with its speed and bolted for the second time in two weeks.
The tortoise escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed the villain was leaving the zoo through the main entrance.
It doesn't die straight away because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, "zoo worker Yoshimi Yamane reported.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is female, 55-kilometer and about a metre long.
Yamane describes the bear as quiet and gentle.
In the opening hours, the villain is allowed to walk freely in the sticky area.
The zoo has received no eyewitness findings about the tortoise.
Konna's last outing occurred the week before.
Yamane found the carer walking along the road 150 metres from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane reported.
It's capable of walking faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your company avoid Uber's mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her online startup business, but the polls did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured that the polls were anonymous, some employees were suspicious of them.
"The polls were simply neither consistent nor objective," Errett says. His hair care company, Madison Reed, focuses on online shopping; the company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
A growing number of new staff management start-ups have entered the market to help other companies figure out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement; companies can conduct surveys and target specific teams and population groups, as well as providing anonymous reporting services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with senior management over government.
"Your own health can be followed by applications like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the corporate Fitbit?" Asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of the Glint startup in Redwood City.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years; he says he has gained a deeper insight into the ideas and feelings of his employees.
The programme can make quick enquiries and votes for certain teams, and it can draw up a map showing at a glance which departments the workers are most dissatisfied with and which managers have received the weakest assessments.
Companies are understood to have to follow a workplace culture to avoid becoming the next Uber; there has been turmoil around the transportation company since a former employee wrote in his blog about a culture where employees are harassed and those talking about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry whose value could reach more than $1187 billion by 2020, according to Let's Talk Payments website.
Convercent, based in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behaviour; interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation suffered a knock.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently struck a deal with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to make customized surveys, collect responses confidentially in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by SMS.
And if the director is to be suspected of wrongdoing, the complaints go directly to the company's government.
"Public opinion has ousted the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercenti.
He recalls that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly, even if the authorities do not intervene; consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose workers and be challenged in court.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations; the company has been using Convercentia for more than a year because it wants to make sure employees are aware of operating principles and policies and easily connect to the headquarters.
In the past, the practice was that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he first had to clear a telephone number or email address to make a notification to the headquarters; then he had to make a formal complaint and hope it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says Ruby Tuesday's legal affairs director James Vitrano, who said complaints from employees were difficult to follow.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state; now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more holistic and comprehensive insight into the reality of an employee," says Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"At the same time, we will protect our shareholders from legal proceedings relating to employment relations."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical conduct in connection with the Enron scandal.
It was only with social media that the companies realised that they could no longer block the public settlement of their likeness.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under the control of ethics," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, the use of which is regularly charged.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by venture capitalists; both Glint and Convercent are backed by venture capitalists.
Convercent collected $10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and tola Capital, which has amassed a total of $47 million in capital.
Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has amassed a total of $60 million in funding.
Investment is no surprise, given the links between business, business culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, workers expect more from their jobs.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and give their time to a genuinely useful company.
"Employees are more committed to the success of the company if they are comfortable in the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, managing director of LinkedIn, a company.
Investors get returns when companies thrive; companies thrive when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it's no wonder they interest investors.
According to workplace culture experts, information on employee engagement is important,
But it is pointless if no action is taken on the basis of it.
If a company asks its employees for feedback, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if change doesn't come fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand conversations," says Russell Raath, president of business management consultancy Kotter International, which has seen companies rely too much on mere data collection.
'if the company doesn't take action, employees will start to wonder if they will be heard
And do their opinions matter.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company? '
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently conducting staff surveys on a monthly basis and will be able to tackle the problem on the same day as it is announced in Glint.
When Errett had gathered feedback on the slow pace of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated employees, he was able to make changes to teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesdays understands its employees better and hopes that deeper understanding will help it improve the long-term sustainability of staff in an industry known for its high turnover of employees.
"If a company doesn't commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees," Vitrano says.
'if it loses employees, it's going to lose customers as well.
And without customers, there are no companies. "
A 20-year-old man in Sweden is suspected of concealing his naked female neighbour, reports news agency TT.
The woman, who lives in Gothenburg, had come home from the shower when she was spotted outside her window with a mobile phone hanging at the end of the narrative.
According to the woman, a mobile phone camera described the apartment.
The woman who was stabbed in the incident had jumped into another room to dress.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the mobile phone had been pulled up first, but soon after it was put back in the window.
A 20-year-old man suspected of filming has admitted to filming the woman.
But he claimed to have only photographed the woman's face.
The video described on the mobile phone had been removed and police had failed to return it as evidence.
During questioning, the man admitted the act but denied committing the crime.
In the caption, the man was justified by saying he loved his neighbour 'just crazy'.
The man will be charged in the case, according to news agency TT.
Teachers call for more lix in autumn talks
Wage growth cannot be lower than in the export industry, for example, but the gap should be narrowed, said OAJ President Olli Luke on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday spending underscores the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements in which the review does not in any way involve the holiday cuts that have been made.
In the municipality sector, contracts will only be reached once the private sector papers have been signed and the interest rates are clear.
Luke predicts that working conditions for OAJ, for example, will be agreed in January.
Procentigoals Luke did not reveal yet.
Luke is also chairman of the public-trained negotiating organisation Juko.
Read MORE: Holiday cut increases earnings gap
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is declining, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luke, a fixed-term holiday cut will sharpen the earnings gap even further.

OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the weakest are growing all the time.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are declining, and differences between pupils and regions continue to grow.
Bruins players' day pipped as NCAA reduced day-to-day exercises from two to one
It will soon be eleven o'clock in the evening; a number of UCLA's American football players have been left to chat on the other side of the campus's new training grounds.
Some have been stripped of their shirts; their backs are shiny from the sand after the first day of training camp.
For quite a few of them, this few minutes of chatting is a midday break.
After three hours of training, players studying the university's summer courses return to their mortgage to read the final exams; the next morning, they gather for half a seventh at the Wasserman football centre.
"The next three days are going to be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday's switch on Tuesday.
The umbrella organisation for university sports reduced the number of daily exercise clubs from two to one; the change was designed to lighten the workload of players, but it has extended their days - at least until Friday, when the final final tests are held.
That is why UCLA's three first exercises started over seven in the evening. It was difficult to find room for the players' already full schedules.
Limiting training sessions to one day means more exercise days; the camp started this year almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time Moran's six-season Westwood training season is being held while training in summer.
The exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the opening match of the season begins: UCLA will face Texas A & M University in September.
Mora says he supported the NCAA's rule change, though it made players' schedules even tougher.
"We really burden them a lot for three or four days and it's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work. They're great guys.
I think it will be easier when we get to Saturday; then we will have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises outside after the camp; it's not easy, given a direct view of the training pitch to the adjacent car park and the Luskin Center, a ramp-up hotel that has already been bombarded with flying football.
The Bruins' players are set to move to the hotel over the coming weekend, but Mora admits problems could arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and describe the exercises from there for the video. It's not an exaggerated concern.
The video of the exercises is paid pretty much.
But we have guards there and in the car park.
We will do our best.
I'm not going to bother my head with it too much.
We have a plan. ""
Freedom in Rwanda
A presidential election will be held in Central African Rwanda on Friday, the winner of which is already being taken for granted.
Paul Kagame is officially seeking his third term, but in practice he has been instrumental in running the country since 1994.
At that time, the rebel group RPF put an end to the genocide organised by the extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of expression.
He has also been accused, for example, of distorting poverty statistics.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to make an effort because the Constitution, which was limited to two periods of the presidential term, was changed.
But in Rwanda, Kagame is also a genuinely held leader.
During his time there have been social reforms in Rwanda and international investment has poured into the country.
In addition, Kagamella has played a major role in uniting a country divided by genocide.
Rwanda's success has led many Africans to question whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
But Kagaus has promised his people more freedom after putting the country on its feet.
Now could be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up fact check
Facebook plans to send potential fake news increasingly to independent fact inspectors, as well as presenting the results under the original article, the world's largest social network announced on Thursday.
The company released a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news; any fake news will be sent to fact inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest distributors of fake news; many believe that fake news influenced the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election.
The topic has risen to political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news ahead of May's presidential election and Germany preparing for the September election supports a plan to fine social media networks if they do not remove hostile content quickly.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that the fact check was being tested in the United States, France, Holland and Germany.
"People want to see which stories don't pass through the walls of independent inspectors; they also want more background information to decide more enlightened what to read and share," Facebook news feed product manager Sara Su wrote in a company blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing the related articles "function and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The birth of a comic book: The story of a castle
Little Scotney Castle in Kent County is now known for its Squeeze music video, as well as Margaret Thatcher's hiding place from the 1970s and 1980s.
But it has 700 years of storytelling history; now this charming site in the Bewlin River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a moppy writer who liked old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to explore a text written by a person who died more than 300 years ago," Rhodes says catapulted.
"I feel a personal connection when I put the letter in my hand." "
Rhodesi's book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scot from the medieval edvarian era; each story is imagined by a different artist, a promising British comic book writer: Isaac Lenkiewicz
This is not Rhodesi's first book based on archives; in 2014 he appeared in Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by documents from the British National Library.
"I moved to tears to find my thumb in the letter; the letter was written by a double agent who worked for Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
'It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell of smoke, because at the time the lighting was used as a fire.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel like he's on the ground himself.
I love the archives! '
The author of the old documents was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust and the National Arts Council of England, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent his days on the radar of the Victorian "new" basement, archives, treasures and rarest, such as the hyenas hanging on the walls and the bottles that had been in power for centuries.
He detonated the old castle with rubble and bricks, and discussed with forest guards, gardeners and sometimes book-imagining artists.
In the evenings, he "took whisky and started writing."
Scotney's closest history is fairly unknown as the castle moved entirely to the National Trust after the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived a dozen years later, the Foundation's staff were only just starting to go through the archives. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held for hundreds of years by the same method: By exporting everything extra to Ullako.
The archives had diaries, letters from the times of the English Empire and maps of who owned what. "One could imagine that land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "Here, however, families kill even one cop.
It came to mind that I would not be allowed to be already. "
Some of the stories in the book go from the castle to the history of England, such as The labourer. It tells of a man who, shortly after the completion of the castle, joined the English peasant rebellion in 1381.
"The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex book mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The peasant revolt in England began in the same area, and it came to mind that the rebellion could begin with a riot.
Maybe these events are connected? '
Other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle - such as The Priest, the story of a priest who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of salesman Arthur Darrell from the 18th century; he is said to have put his own funerals by filling the arrow with stones (it was discovered years later, when his grave was opened).
Darrell is Rhodesi's favourite family in Scotney. "The men in the family seem to have been quite vegan; they were constantly in debt and bought things they could not afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by getting married to wealthy old women.
Now Rhodes is seeking new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book on the Life of Life, the healer of the early 20th century, of which only eutrophication is left.
The Scotney bird has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to go from there," he says.
"I wouldn't have wanted to go back to that streak yet." "
Relations with Russia the worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated markedly, commented NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, "Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability in Russia's eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO remains committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not escalate to their peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid further escalation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump tweeted that the US-Russia rift had reached even dangerously bad levels.
Trump urged praise for the countries' bad relations with Congress, which passed new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko stops - rematch against Anthony Joshua won't happen
Professional boxing's long-time heavyweight world champion Vladimir Klitshko will end his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who hit gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, played as a professional 69 times, winning 64 of the matches.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost the last two matches of his career.
Tyson Fury pulled him off the piste in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitshko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost a furious match after a knock in the 11th set.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to face a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
But Klitshko found no motivation for the match.
I deliberately took a few weeks to make the decision to get enough distance from the match at Wembley, "Klitshko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional boxing player, I achieved everything I dreamed of and now I want to start my second career after the sport.
I could never have imagined I had such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitshko's reasoning for his decision on the video.
Klitshko's manager Bernd Bönte told the briefing that the decision to stop was difficult for Klitshko.
But he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he doesn't have enough motivation anymore.
That's why this is definitely the right decision, "Bönte said.
Klitshko has been partnering with US actress Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple have one child, daughter Kaya, who was born in 2014.
Klitshko's big brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight world champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated the World Cup titles of the various federations at the same time.
Finnish weather breaker noises about conditions: 'Take a fiil'
Pole skipper Minna Nikkanen has been affected by the conditions during the summer's external season.
Minna Nikkasella has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and cold have taken the woman from the fireplace.
There are volatile conditions at the World Cup in London.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
Conditions have been in pole position this season against Minna Nikka.
I don't want to blame the rap, but it was inconceivable that I didn't even get the small jerseys to properly move, "Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck contest.
I have competed and practiced here for the umpteenth time and I have never experienced the same variable wind in this place, "Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
The standard of jumping this season has been really tricky when there have been such volatile winds in the exercises, "Nikkanen said at the Kaleva Games.
The weather spoke on Thursday in London.
Pretty challenging has been to get the technology to pile up - whether it's a cold jumper or what.
It has been cold and windy and it has taken a fie.
There is no point in consuming energy in bad circumstances.
He got into the hallway with 455 thanks to the World Cup.
The outfit has gone 445.
The beer ratio is not the same for everyone in London.
You have to be calm and expect better winds.
The goal is to surpass 460 in Friday's qualifying.
What else to work out abroad?
It is not necessary.
Last summer I was at the start of the season in Italy and Germany.
I was able to jump into the pile and the technique standard.
I think we should have done the same now.
Normally you have got into the hall to train, now the hall has been closed.
What would it be like to be a lovely cat?

A little wind happens, as long as it is constant.
An experienced ex-official shouted at politicians at Yale: "We have nothing to pay for now and not for many years"
Despite the positive economic climate, the government of Juha Sipilä must keep ice in the hat and be careful not to inflate the state budget with debt, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has prepared the Treasury budgets for decades.
There is no pay-as-you-go, "he said.
In 2015, YLE interviewed the entertainer Virta in Wednesday's mass shooting.
Construction of the state's budget for next year is just beginning.
Recent proposals from politicians, such as raising the guarantee pension, reducing the car tax and supporting electric bikes, are seen by Virtanen as election speeches.
They mostly tell us that elections are starting to close, because when 10% of the state budget is funded by additional debt, we have nothing to pay for now and not for many years.
I even find it a fraud to talk about pay-as-you-go when debt is taken, "Virtanen told GENERAL.
Virtanen stressed that all debt is owed to children.
Virtas has a long history of preparing state budgets: In 1978, he began as the Treasury's budget secretary and then worked as the budget department's deputy chief of staff and budget director.
Most recently, before retiring, he served as chancellor of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
Virtanen pointed out in an interview with Yle that the now projected 3 percent economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All the forecasters estimate that this is a thorn from which we are starting to go underwater next year, and Finland is expecting a 1% increase for decades.
Washington changes rules for permanent residency
President Donald Trump announced, according to the media, that the rules of the permanent residence permit, Green Cardin, would be changed by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and restrict family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and are backed by the president.
The draft law is expected to be debated in two chambers of Congress.
'This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy, "Trump said, according to the media.
Danish Queen's wife doesn't want to be buried with Queen in same place
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
Photo Prince Henry and Queen Margaret, pictured in April.
Denmark's Queen Margaret, 77, and her husband Prince Henry, 83, will not be buried next to each other, says Danish hovi.
Traditionally, government couples in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The royal has today announced that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in Roskilde's jurisdiction, hovi says in a statement on Thursday.
According to Bt magazine, the reason for this is the Prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It's no secret that Prince has been unhappy with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, hov's communications director Lene Belleby commented in the magazine.
For Prince, the decision not to bury him alongside the Queen is a natural consequence of not being treated on an equal footing with his wife.
According to hov, the Queen has long been aware of the desire for her husband's funeral and understands the decision.
Horror moment on the road: A car had to come on top of a highway
Tommi had an unmarried partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident but do not receive the money from the insurance if the other party is not reached.
The crash happened at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Photo The construction site of the ring III.
Vantaan Tommi says his family miraculously survived a car crash on Tuesday.
Tommi, his unmarried partner Riina and the couple's two small children were driving along the highway at Keimolanport in the direction of Vantaalla Hämeenlinna.
Ring III's connection to the Hämeenlinnan route drove a speeding lane along the white car, which was to drive the family's car into the village, Tommi says.
Without the color movement, the car would have come on top, according to Tomm.
I grabbed and turned the car at the same time and it got out of hand, "Tommi says.
The family's car crashed at high speed into the street.
The parents and two small children who were in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is a little under 3 years old, the other less than a year old.
It was obviously a pretty good tutor when nothing happened to us.
No one drove even towards us, even though there was lively traffic.
The crash happened at around 5.20pm.
According to Tommin, no one stopped at them and the family phoned the emergency department.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and rescue staff came to the scene and the family's condition was checked.
The car went to redemption.
Tommi says he and the unmarried partner had a small income and received a grant from the family to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without information from another car, the family will not receive the money from the insurance, according to Tommi.
That is why the family is hoping for eyewitnesses to find out about the car, which was why the family drove into the street.
We need a car every day.
It is difficult to take children to the garden and work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, solid car.
It was probably the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thought the start of the car's registration number was SIG.
If the culprit is not caught, I do not know how we will manage financially, we will have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that those who have seen or know about what has happened are in contact with the police.
The East Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Service are confirmed to have played a role at the crash site on Tuesday night.
The title and the story were corrected at 9.15 p.m.: Contrary to what was originally reported in the story, the second car, according to Tommi, did not enter the receiving lane, but was driven from the speeding lane to the family car.
Directed by Lotta Jäppinen, the show deals with human relationships through humour - The self-discovery is seen at the What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, brings her premiere guide to the "What?" Theatre.
Self-discovery is a musical theatre performance that goes wrong with past relationships and inadequacy.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still leaves a good mind.
The subject is dealt with by means of humour.
Nasty emotions don't stay on the line, "he says.
The rotating summer theatre, according to Jäppinen, has been carried out with a picnic budget and a large, youthful heart.
The name of the motion challenges the question of what man reveals about himself when he becomes acquainted with a new man.
Will he perhaps take on a role or will another jacket be open?
Juoneton's presentation confuses fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both guided and dramatised the presentation.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The proposal is made up of texts from the working group and there is no plot.
The director believes that while the presentation amplifies the ideas of young people, it speaks to people of all ages.
Jäppinen stresses that the Itself detector does not directly reveal his own or the human relationships of the working group.
Fact and fiction are confused.
My own world of values will certainly be conveyed in the motion.
I do not think that human relationships are bad, but nor do I think that a human relationship, especially a couple's relationship, is a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes the Itself detector is drawing an up-to-date picture of young adults living in a hundred-year-old Finland.
According to him, many have learned a lot about human relationships with their parents, many of whom have resigned.
At least the fact that you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The motion shows Minea Lång, Niklas Rauté and Otto Rokka.
The team also includes pub owner Ella Snellman.
The atonement of music is Jäppinen and roka.
Love for theatre broke out in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying as a director of theatre expression at the Turku Academy of Applied Sciences.
Behind is two years and in front of another mom.
Jäppinen's enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the Kouvola years.
The educator of music classes has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and played, among other things, at the University Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at Linnatheater in Turku.
The steering has become more and more interesting.
The self-revealed actress made her first appearance on the Narri stage in Helsinki last week.
A presentation lasting about 45 minutes should also be seen in the future, at least in the city of Jäppinen in Turku.
Self-discovery at the Kouvola What? Theatre on April 8 at 19: 00 and May 8 at 14: 19.
Finnish Olympic champion recovers for a year from gruesome motocross accident - collar fracture
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
Trump tweeted the world hundreds of days a year for a couple of years and shared his dream of Olympic gold.
The ghost happened in 2002, but Lahtela's movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainee, but also an experimenter of new species.
There may not be many forms of physical activity on earth, which the chemical lake would not have tried at least once.
It's excited to exercise.
There is always something new, "Lahtela says.
In the end, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahtela was hit by a motocross.
As a result, his collar and both hands were broken.
I was nowhere to work.
I slept with wounds in my home for a year, "Lahtela says.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a part in the turf.
Driving on the sidewalk can sound cheeky.
But I did not apply for limits.
It is only as a species so hard that on issues like four is not worth too much exercise!
After the accident, Lahtela was placed in an unusual situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
Behind was a long rub as the head coach of Japan's freestyle team.
Lahtela started in the nest immediately after ending his own career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be in my place.
I didn't really do much, "Lahtela says.
During his coaching career, Lahtela often challenged his protections in slopes and physicality tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so tired that my own thoughts didn't feel reasonable.
Not even on the species.
Did well to be in place.
I really enjoyed it because I really just got to be for once.
The mandatory break stunned Lahtela as Finland's head coach.
Without stopping, he was afraid that it would have come to an end.
It's easier for Kropasta to find places that have gone out of the way than the ehill!
Without the accident I would not have realised I needed rest so much.
Lahtela started as a coach for the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby in place of fast bowlers.
I switched my motocross to frisbeegolphin!
After all, it just got out of the bag straight away.
At worst, I was seven hours a day throwing.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-keen workout player himself, he does not require his coaching staff to be similar to him.
I'm not forcing everyone into the same mould.
There is room in our species culture to be their own and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style and the mentality has always been consistent with it, Lahtela says.
Sex robots come and we need to worry
It's here: A report on the evolution of technology in the sex robot industry - just when it had started to feel like 2017 could no longer become more bizarre.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within the next 5 to 10 years.
"We need to start taking seriously the prevalence of sex robots," says the foundation's founding member and professor of robotics and artificial intelligence emeritus Noel Sharkey from the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the colour of the robot's eyes, the shape of the tins and the type of fingerprints.
"There are sleeves for sex robots, but they're already being sold quite a lot, and we're going to see more of them," Sharkey said at the release of the report.
Sex dolls have evolved from breathable dolls to robots with warm-looking silicone skin, as well as features created by artificial intelligence that resemble human behaviour.
The user can also adapt the robot to its own preferences, from the colour of the eyes to the shape of the nose and the type and colour of the fingers.
All the more worrying is that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford's women look like progressive fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, for example as a swim.
The Roxxy Gold robots of True Companion have an estranged personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"Roxxy Goldin's personality adapts as fully as possible to the user's personality," the company's website advertised.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has a different mood:
It may, for example, be tired, drunk or "in that mood."
There are many worrying features in the prevalence of sex robots, which replace genuine human relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies, when a user approaches, for example, a robot programmed to swim.
On its website, True Companion compares the Roxxy robot to a vibrator:
"Women have a vibrator. Why shouldn't men have a sex robot?"
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their proliferation and development is indicative of something darker and deeper in our culture: A downturn in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, in which subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, the majority of men don't tap into a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, although the FRR report tells of their growing popularity.
But marginal phenomena say a lot about the spirit of time.
And many begin to behave strangely or offensive only when the market gives permission to do so.
It's no coincidence that sex robots have begun to become more common at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world and a president sitting in the White House has boasted about harassing women.
In the television series, The Handmaid's Tale (Orjattaresi) is not the most worrying of its powerful visual language, for example, images of hanged bodies and out-of-control eyes.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it feels like a surprisingly short journey.
Attempts are being made to make sex robots as much like real women (on the scale of porn stars) as is technically possible.
Robots developers want their skin to feel authentic and movements to emulate human movements as well as possible.
But their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot is unable to leave the relationship or the situation.
They do not have their own will or history - nothing to refer to independence or to break the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Orjattaria.
Police suspect: Australia planned two acts of terrorism, group led by Isis chief
The head of the extremist organisation Isis led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to carry a bomb on an Etihad Airways plane.
A person belonging to Isis's senior figures was also sent to Sydney for building parts of the bomb, according to Sydney Morning Heraldi.
According to the suspect, the bomb was supposed to be taken off the plane on July 15, but the company was interrupted before a security check.
Police will not elaborate on why the company was interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a device separating toxic colourless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport facility.
Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were captured in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continuing.
The virtues of Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like a beacon of common sense
In Trump's era, it has already been repeated with nausea that the powerful division of voters at everyday levels has also haunted families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day, the advisory pals of American newspapers signaled how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want to clean up our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to unite families.
I tell you this because my cousin was in a village this week with me in New York, a left-leaning poet living in Chicago who has long had buttons against the Republicans of our family.
"A common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect," he recalled.
Now that Trump is in the White House, cousins all acquaintances - including a Republican-backed sister with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades - are suddenly and suddenly on the same side.
At the dinner table it is a good thing, but more broadly, it carries significant risks.
Trump has given a new flow to the left, but the twisted effect of his presidency may actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trumpism and "normalization," we talk about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to shake his temper.
In the long run, there is an even more gruesome possibility that Trump will normalize the right fringe Republicans who, compared to Trump, suddenly seem quite reasonable.
I think back to Mitt Romney's restrained version of madness: A dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (and his tax returns we have at least seen).
Once Trump's term is over, the Republicans "next presidential nominee will only need to be clear-headed, and it immediately feels like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the carousel of Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best thing New York gets for $3 without caffeine.
The carousel's horses are huge, the characters in the middle - grotesque clowns and animals watching in horror - are ominous, and the underlying shielding music is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York's halls are loosened over time to disappointment: The outlook for high-rise buildings is starting to get weary, the city's sideline becomes too familiar and the city's reality doesn't match dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I have not completely overcome the fact that Swiss cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large roundabout in north London.
The carousel of Central Park, on the other hand, is still a strange magical experience - even to the extent that two two-year-olds, one one-year-old and two four-year-old women enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but luckily no one came to ask.
Instead, I was asked at a department store this week to assess my "payment experience" on a scale from one to five stars before I put my credit card on a reading device.
It is the same in a cafe in my home country, but there I am also given the opportunity to combine an estimate of 15% of the service when I go to a coffee shop.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer service to put his person in the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The department store seller smiled with regret as I excitedly gave five stars to the experience of using my credit card.
Shefki Kuqi was sacked from Interview - "There was no leadership confidence"
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuq from the role of coach of the club's representative team.
The coaching responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Piccareta, who was previously assistant coach.
The rest of the coaching team will continue in their current roles.
Italian Piccareta has worked as an assistant coach in the past, including at English Sunderland.
In January, the 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined Inter's coaching team, completed his UEFA Pro licence last year.
Stefan Håkans, chairman of the FC Interstate government, regrets what happened.
Switching a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
But Shefki Kuqi no longer had the confidence of the club's management, with no other option now, Håkans commented in the club's news release.
Piccareta's contract runs until the end of the season.
He, along with the rest of the coaching team, is already in charge for tomorrow's home match against HIFK.
According to data from evening-Sanomaa, the team has been in turmoil throughout Thursday.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the club's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been sidelined.
Kuqi and Piccareta took a strong lead in Inter's match against PS Kemp last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youthful image from the 80s - would you identify a serious violin student?
Violet tourist Linda Lampenius posted a youthful photo on Instagram.
A number of spiders have been added to the picture to conclude that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student.
Lampenius himself wonders about a young woman looking at a serious camera.
Long ago, serious, he signals.
If the picture is not shown, you can watch it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful subjects.
Just over a year ago, she posted on Instagram a picture of herself.
In another picture, she is seen 20 years ago, in another she posits now, as a mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius is reflecting on his own growth as a human being, referring to eating disorders he suffered as a junior.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look much the same as that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to keep myself and what I look like, "Lampenius wrote.
After the text, she had added English hashtags about life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, ageing is tidy.
Lampenius has spoken candidly about his eating disorders in previous years.
She was already in hospital at the age of 14 due to anorexia and ortorexia.
A little later, he also contracted bulimia, which was eventually revealed only in 2006.
The healing started slowly.
In addition to therapy and parenting, Lampeniu was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius delivered from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital treatment for cooling in his ranch, which he, according to prison officials, received after being dumped in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original murder conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by firing several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder who was hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again as they consider Pistorius's six-year sentence too lenient.
The attorney general plans to appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal will possibly be heard as early as this year.
If the appeal is upheld, Pistorius's sentence could be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camp in Greece
Two illegally camp Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, reported the country's foreign ministry, according to the bTV channel.
Police arrested a number of undocumented people in Sithonia on the morning of 1 August, including two Bulgarians.
They were still released the same day, but the investigation into the incident continues.
According to television channel bTV, the Foreign Office later announced the release of the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free campsites and are already imposing hefty fines on anyone who camps in non-designated areas.
Inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may alleviate irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like the nightmares of the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: A diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may ease irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in Britain, causing stomach cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Those suffering from irritable bowel syndrome are generally advised to avoid meat and dairy products; however, researchers at the University of Washington found that the necessary amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen.
According to study director Marco Colonna, immune cells patrol the mouth and ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food do not enter the body.
Cells that cause inflammation are balanced by cells that strengthen resilience; they protect the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance drops too close to inflammation, the result may be irritable bowel syndrome.
The experiments found that immune cells that strengthen resilience are found in mice with a certain bacteria in their intestines.
This bacterium needs tryptophan so that immune cells begin to appear; Tryptophan is one of the building materials for proteins.
"We found a link between Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of resistant cells. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal microbiome of the intestine," Professor COLONNA says.
"The more the mice diet had tryptophan, the more they had such immune cells."
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal resilience and reduce inflammation sensitivity.
In studying immune cells that strengthen resilience, researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that while one group of mice had such cells, they were not found in the mice of the same mouse species that were kept separate from another.
He suspected that the difference was related to the microbiome of the mouse's intestines, that is, the digestive system's normal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
When the DNA of the mice's intestines was examined, six bacteria were found in the mice that had immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were given to mice grown in a sterile environment that had no intestinal microbiome and did not develop immune cells, immune cells began to appear.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system; they bred Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the liquid and transferred small amounts of liquid - without bacteria - from the mouse to isolated immature immune cells.
Immune cells evolved into cells that strengthen resilience.
When the active ingredient was cleaned from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as indoli-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptofan in mouse food, the number of cells strengthening resilience rose by about 50 percent; when the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells dropped by half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same resilience-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus reuteri cells will develop in humans in the same way as mice.
"We certainly want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation in the inside of the intestine," Cervantes-Barragan says.
"High tryptophan levels, combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria, may contribute to their prevalence."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a 'genius' in their ranks after making a deal with Nemanja Matip
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a 'genius' in their ranks after making a deal with Nemanja Matip, the midfield player debuting Manchester United's ranks in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for £40million, started with a 2-1 victory in Dublin, United's last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday, impressed as a defensive midfielder
Matic, however, was not yet in his best shape as he was not involved in the Asian tour of the blue shirt before the start of the season - he fared on the pitch in just 45 minutes - with Mourinho reportedly
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking make him a genius - he has a natural football mentality," Mourinho says.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later." "
In addition to Matip, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to cool his starting line-up for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants three more players, although the club has already done a "fantastic job" by acquiring three of his four top-ranked players.
"Three out of four - you have to give the club credit," he added.
'i'm happier if I get all four but they did an excellent job.'
Air balloons embarrass Germany for two instalments
Finland's women's volleyball team lost their fourth match of the World Cup qualifier against Germany directly to Erin 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany's routine in gambling is high.
Steady their game was in every sector, "Finnish head coach Tapio Kangasniemi told the briefing.
In the first two innings, Finland kept their opponents at bay, but in the third period Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the blocks.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to stick with it, "Kangasniemi said.
Finland's most efficient was 14 points collected by Piia Korhonen.
Finland, who lost three matches out of four, will still face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Grand jury already sent challenges to Trump Jr's Russia meeting
In the United States, a grand jury has sent challenges to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A grand jury convened by special prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent challenges to a meeting between Donald Trump Jr and Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The matter is reported by news agency Reuters, which at the same time confirms the information revealed by the Wall Street Journal earlier on Thursday about the convening of a grand jury.
According to Reuters, a grand jury has sent challenges in connection with a meeting between Trump Jr. and Kremlin-linked Veselnitskaya, which took place in the middle of the US presidential election in June 2016.
Also in attendance were Donald Trump Sr's then-campaign manager Paul Manafort, as well as his uncle, White House current adviser Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has called a grand jury in Washington marks an intensification of the pace of the Russia investigation.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to help with an investigation into Russian meddling in the US presidential election and whether Trump's campaign or his entourage colluded with Russia.
A grand jury will expand Mueller's rights to gather evidence, send challenges and force people to testify before a jury.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
A grand jury is weighing the evidence in the prosecutor's investigation and will decide whether charges should be brought in the case.
British inventor microchipped himself to get into his home and car with hand waving
The British inventor is the first across the country to microchip himself to open his home's outer door, get into his office and launch his car with a hand waving.
The chip is between the thumb and eyesore of 33-year-old Steven Northam, who now offers a service to businesses and individuals who want to ease their lives with the technology of Northam's BioTeq.
Northam is working with the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester Hants to consult sleeping doctor Geoff Watson to ensure the installation of the microchip meets medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technique as cat and dog chips, and its installation takes just 30 seconds.
Northam's company also turns the locks of houses and cars into a compatible microchip; handling one lock costs £300.
Northam is married and has one child; he has installed microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4 car, which kicks off when he puts his hands on the steering wheel.
White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's last decision to fly a naval helicopter to the southern lawn of the White House for an event presenting American production came to cost taxpayers $24,000, according to military documents obtained by TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is used as Marine One when the president is on its board; it was vetted at an event at the White House on 17 July 2017 to showcase American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike pence and a number of White House officials looked at products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter, which was manufactured in Connecticut, the samples included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truffle from Mississippi.
The White House military office had asked the helicopter for a mission order just about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn for an "extraordinary" event, according to documents from the Navy's HMX-1 helicopter fleet.
"I just wanted to make sure you were aware of it because this is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 unit wrote in an email to his boss on the day before the event.
The message reported that the helicopter would arrive on the southern lawn at 17: 7 in the morning and the event would start at three in the afternoon; the helicopter would only leave after the lawn was emptied between six and nine in the evening.
The message also mentioned that if the helicopter's departure from the white house were to be delayed, another crew would be needed because of restrictions on service time.
The original crew was in the helicopter for the event and the unit's security personnel were in the helicopter while it was in the country.
Documents obtained by Time magazine did not reveal whether another crew was eventually needed.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 questioned whether the event violated the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a breach of the Hatch Act; we were told there was no breach," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the assistant comedian replied.
Made in America was an official event at the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president spoke out in favour of the health care reform that was before the Senate at the time, as well as looser state regulation.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their travels,
But using them only for photos is unusual.
Trump's actions raised eyebrows in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of a presidential campaign event in Melbourne's Florida state; Trump has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor's presidential plane on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which presented products made from American materials by American workers from all 50 states," said White House press secretary Lindsay Walters.
Crews from the HMX-1 unit regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and practice on the southern lawn to bring the president to the White House with centimetre accuracy.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 exercise landings for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America included the crew's monthly training quota.
The unit's helicopters also flew for 11 hours that day in "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said the event did not cost the taxpayer any other expenses.
A spokesman for Sikorsky reported that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter demonstration on the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 has no accounting for flights related to the president's duties, and an accurate assessment of the cost of the event is difficult.
According to the Department of Defense's 2017 hourly compensation, the VH-3D helicopter has a compensation level of $24,380 per flight hour.
According to documents from the HMX-1 unit, flights from Quantico's base from Virginia State to the White House and back lasted a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the cost of operating the helicopter is markedly lower.
"Calculating the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called sunk costs that will be taken into account in the annual envelope," the statement said.
According to a 2015 study by the RAND research company, compensation levels do not include staff costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to showcase American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and will probably employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defence equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is entirely appropriate to point this out. "
It's not certain whether Trump was walking in a helicopter during the event, but at least he hit the driver of the fire car.
At the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky Squad.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."

Venezuela's state prosecutor calls for justice to block appointment of country's new assembly
Venezuela's state prosecutor has sought a court ruling that would block the appointment of the country's new assembly.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that a representative elected in last Sunday's vote is expected to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, the country was elected an assembly that could, among other things, change the country's constitution.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the blocking decision has been requested due to suspicions of electoral fraud.
Ortega has also launched an electoral fraud investigation into the vote.
He appointed two judges to the task after the British company that organised the assembly vote reported that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities was about a million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated for office, and the elected 545-member assembly includes, among others, Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to changing the constitution, the assembly can dissolve the opposition-led Congress and change laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the reshaping of the constitution as a way for Maduro to strengthen his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro, calling this a dictator.
For their part, the European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they will not recognise the new representative.
Maduro argues that the new assembly is the solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, the unrest has been going on for months.
Many people have been wounded and more than a hundred have died.
Venezuela plunged into an economic crisis after falling oil prices.
Now many people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when a new assembly is scheduled to begin.
Russian man extradited by Finland sentenced to 4 years in prison in US
A Minneapolis court in the United States on Thursday sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senah to four years in prison for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 following a request from the United States.
According to Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been holidaying in Finland.
He was arrested by Finnish border authorities while he was returning home.
Finland handed Senah to US judicial authorities in February 2016 despite Russian protests, reports news agency AFP.
He was found guilty in March this year of computer fraud that had gained the benefit of millions of dollars.
Senah received 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported from the country after serving a prison sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry reprimanded Finland after the arrest and said the man should not be extradited to the United States.
In a statement, Finland and the United States were criticised for the fact that the arrest was made in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus fished user names and passwords.
The fraudsters then used the data to continue directing internet traffic to make clicking scams and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, acting director of the Justice Department's crime department, the case shows that the United States is capable of chasing cybercriminals operating in other countries as well.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, "Blanco told the briefing.
Edited at 8.58 p.m.: Corrected the name of the convicted person in the flat.
Trailer for Narcos' third production season: Pablo Escobar is out of the charts, so the Cali cartel rises to the top of Netflix's hit series
While Pablo Escobar's killer was revealed in Narcos's second production season, the Netflix series is certainly not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the series will see its third and fourth season of production; the trailer for the third season has been made public and will showcase a series of new episodes.
In its third production season, the US drug police DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world's richest drug trafficking organization.
The organisation, led by four godparents, operates "like a Fortune 500 company," except that there is a little more corruption and violence on the part of the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is the brains behind it; Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) performs in New York.
In a newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal makes a return to Javier Peñana, coloring American and Colombian police in the war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third production season starts on September 1.
Kari Kola performs extraordinary photographic work in Paris
The great white artist Kari Kola (in pictures) will perform an extraordinary photographic work to mark the UN's first Valo Day in Paris on 16 May next year.
Kola is doing a photographic work in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - the sun and the moon.
The works illuminate the UNESCO headquarters of the Fontenoy building and the Globe monument off it.
In my work, I would like to highlight not only light but also darkness.
Today, the power rate in millions of cities is a major problem affecting the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make the things I have experienced as important tangible visible, "says the photographer Kari Kola of his work.
I am well received for the invitation to participate in the first International Valo Day and to bring the footage as part of the Day, "Kola continues.
Kari Kola attended the opening of the Valo Year in 2015, when she shed light on the celebration at the UNESCO headquarters.
I feel very privileged to be able to carry out my art again at the UNESCO headquarters, "Kari Kola says.
The work may still expand very significantly.
We will inform you about this later in the coming autumn, "Kola continues.
The aim of International Valo Day is to highlight the importance of light for mankind and to raise people's awareness of the areas of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Valo Day will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in the centre of Paris on May 16.
Two men fight in shopping centre park hall in Espoo
The two men were found in a dispute at a shopping centre in Espoo at a park hall in Great Britain on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute arose when the other party accidentally drove a banned driving gun.
There was a verbal dispute between the drivers.
The driver, who was driving on a banned drive, would hug the driver of another car, as a result of which this car went off and crashed into the driver's car.
He then slammed the still-crashed car into a machine gun.
In a preliminary statement, the man admitted that he had caused the damage and that he had done wrong.
Timo Soine on the question mark with the headline: "After that came a flood of water"
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (uv.) released a blog post on Thursday that made headlines with a question mark.
The writing is short, just two sentences.
In my time, the party grew from zero to a governing party of thirty-seven MPs.
Then came the flood, now everything is floating, "Soini writes.
Soin's text contains references to 18th-century France.
The madame de Pompadour of King Louis XV, or this beloved Queen, is known to have used an underwater metaphor.
Depending on the interpretation, the books of history have been left with the words' after us the flood of water 'or' after me the flood of water '.
UN says Afghan democracy depends on women's political role
Elections will only be representative if they can vote for all members of society, including women, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, interim director of the UN Assistance Mission, said hundreds of women were nominated in provincial council elections, three women are seeking vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasised," Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghanistan's provincial council and presidential elections are held on April 5, 2017.
The Taliban have made election threats at the same time as international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's election is the first time that power has passed peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said the women's contribution will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

The influx of certain types of tourists poses a threat to the region's culture
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
Italy's culture minister calls it "eat and flee" tourism: The site is only a few hours away and rushing through the sights of the big crowds.
Venice has been inundated with urgent day trips for tourists to the city.
The narrow streets are difficult to move around and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the people of Venice no longer fit into the crowd.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic centre while homes have been replaced by hotels.
The problems of tourism in Venice are written by The New York Times and The Guardian.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, time is given two or three hours.
Follow the flag-holding guide from Piazzale to the Rialto Bridge and St Mark's Tower, and turn back, describing Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini as the prevailing and troubling tourist.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the running of places, shops and workshops.
We need to preserve this part of urban identity.
St Mark's Square is also one of the most popular visits to the historic centre of Venice.
On the edge of the tower is St Mark's Church.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
Fifty thousand local people live in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, there were about 175,000 residents.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians demonstrated against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has undermined their quality of life, destroying the environment and driving residents away.
About 2,000 residents leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years "time Venice will not be like tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who organised the demonstration.
It is a difficult equation, as ships bring to Venice the income it desperately needs and create the need for numerous jobs in various sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution is to move the crossers further away from the historic centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, believes that the situation would certainly change if the administrative area of Veneto, where Venice is located, were given more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Around 20 to 30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
Are you driving in Kuopio?
Hundreds of miles of congestion on the motorway
On the north side of the motorway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, there have been miles of congestion at the time of the return traffic on Thursday afternoon.
The area is doing the coating work of the highway, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
In the case of data, there is a limit of 50 kilometres per hour instead of the usual speed of 120 kilometres per hour.
Even in the 50 km limit area, however, on Thursday afternoon traffic had been moving at a practically walking rate in some places.
On Thursday afternoon, the roads were on the side of Lake Siilinjärvi in the case of the Ilrotys statue, that is to say the golden neck.
I will do well without such attention
The 23-year-old drinker has caught the eye of celebrities.
Amalie Iuel has published wonderful pictures of herself in the landscapes of the Grand Canyon, among others.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has emerged as a popular athlete in her current home country of Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record of 400 metres in March by beating the track record at 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400 metres hurdles at the time of Norway's record of 55.38.
Iuel, who works diligently on social media, soon after his record, noticed the downside of belonging and publicity.
Men around the world began posting pictures of Iuellle's sex life, apparently in the hope that the young drinker would take an interest in them.
Iuel was forced to shut down his Snapchat accounts from outsiders.
I got a lot of "screen pictures" from strangers, so I was forced to turn my account into private, "Iuel told VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of images he received.
You can probably guess, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after the race, but I will do well without such a different kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, a father Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalien was 2 years old.
As a result of his father's work, the 12-year-old family moved first to Namibia, then to Pakistan.
Then came Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university student at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, returning to Norway.
In June 2015, he switched Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is training under the guidance of three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to debate than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask anything, they just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has a lot more time to be personally involved with the athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the Norwegian record in the 400 metres and 400 metres hurdles.
The injury took snowballer Janne Korven's entire career into question - now involved in the World Cup: "Nice when you don't get anywhere"
Now it has been nice to count when nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, who is one of the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has been able to truly enjoy her beloved species again this season.
Until last summer, the continuation of a career was at stake.
The foot injury had forced the raven to the cutting table in January and the leg did not want to heal in any way.
The midfielder had taken a hit in the contest.
In the summer I didn't know anything I would do, whether I would continue to sing or not.
The sponsors were on the roof and a lot of things were open, "Korpi says.
But it is said that things tend to be organised.
The leg improved, the sponsor extended his contract for two years, and the blood started to pull off the slopes again.
The follow-up decision was then easy.
I knew it at the latest when I went to the EKA once in the snow.
I was that hemmetti, yes this again is so fun, pulled out a couple more seasons.
It was only in September and October that Korpi was able to count properly, but after a long period of parenting, it has been a big thing to work out as a painter.
The Games Korpi has evaded only a few.
It doesn't hurt.
The competitions have never been the most important aspect of Korvelle's singing.
I have never fallen because of one cat.
Mun thinks it's frustrating to aim for four years at the same Games, and then I expect to have a fever that week.
I can't think so, "Korpi says.
Today, Korpi will race in the halfpipe of the World Cup in Spain's Sierra Nevada.
Even if the individual championships don't like him on the plate, he will always break out in a tough club.
According to Corven, the valuation of the Games organised by the International Ski Federation has increased over the past few years, although some of the board members complained about the Norwegian X-Games being held at the same time.
Yes these are important games, visibility is big.
However, as far as I am concerned, appreciation always depends on the conditions and the level of the Games.
Korpi is the oldest athlete of Finland's 12-man team in the Sierra Nevada.
The team's holes, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are pale 14 years younger.
It's nice to watch the younger guys go.
I remember when I myself was at that point that everything was new and was so sick excited about everything.
It brings a new flow to itself, "Korpi thinks.
On the slopes I still have some way to go, but otherwise I don't, that's how much is flowing in the cronies!
Behind the singing career, Janne Korpi has also built a different sports career.
The son of assistant legend Pekka Korven has been hooked on racer sports: The board has its own racehorses for which he does training programs.
When I am in rehab all the time, I do not have time to be in the mall.
But every day I look at at least the cravings and usually something from the baseline, "Korpi says.
Racing and racer coaching are a potential career plan, according to Korven, when the singing career comes to an end in due course.
I don't hate to plan that far, but it's at least a likely option.
I feel like it's a bit like I'm studying it here, along with snowboarding.
I try to stay on the nerves of the time and develop, in the summer maybe drive something from the start.
If it is mun's future profession, then it is not difficult to start when you are already inside the species.
The Ravills also include an Elitloppet cruise with presenter Jaajo Linnumaa.
The twin has leased a cruise ship heading towards Stockholm's Elitloppet food competition in late May.
Korpi and Linna decided to resurrect the old tradition.
The cruise has gone very long and people have been thrilled.
We are now at the point where, at least, there will be no bankruptcy.
There's still a few months to go, let's hope to get the ship full, "Korpi says enthusiastically.
Attendon's care home project for Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new, 41-seat elderly care home built in Kitee.
A building of more than 1,700 square metres will be completed next summer on the other side of the health route of the health centre.
For Kitee, the general point of wonder is where the new care unit will be enough for customers, because now, during the Siu wars, many private care homes are poised for customer shortages.
Anne Flink Attendolta, regional director of care services, commented that Kitee will have more demand in the future not only for options but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Attendo bought private nursing homes in Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The transaction was related to the business, but the property reportedly has a five-year lease.
Flink says there is no acute need for Attendon to move operations away from these facilities.
More on the subject later today.
GMB concerned about continued operation of McVitie's brand Scottish factory
The union is seeking confirmation from the directors of McVitie's invention manufacturer for a long-term commitment to production at a factory in Glasgow.
According to the GMB Scotland department of Britain's general trade union, the company has not told of its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
There are more than 500 employees at the plant that produces Hobnobs- and Rich Tea biscuits and other products.
Pladis, which owns McVitie's brand, said it had invested more than £5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and union representatives would "certainly be told first" if there were any changes to the action.
In a letter to the chief executive, the GMB urges the company to "respond to concerns that no funding has been allocated to modernize production lines."
The GMB trade union's Drew Duffy finds it extremely worrying that the factory manager will not be given clear information about the needs of Tollcross's business and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and in the metropolitan area of Glasgow, which is a major employer in the area of high unemployment and poor livelihoods.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as Brexit, rising living costs and a continued reduction in production, eastern Glasgow needs a successful McVitie's production "badly."
A spokesman for Pladish said the factory manager had only received a letter from the union the previous day and the company is responding to the letter directly because it appreciates the ongoing interaction with employees and union representatives.
'We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago when we openly discussed a number of issues.
We discussed with employees, among other things, that, like other companies in a highly competitive and uncertain market, we are constantly evaluating all of our businesses and outlets in order to remain competitive. "
The spokesman said the company has invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant in recent years, particularly in its production lines and improving operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a production plant and will certainly be the first to tell employees and trade union representatives if we are going to make changes to the factory," the statement said.
Did PSG beat Barcelona on Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret their interest in Marco Silva
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up their pursuit of Neymar after paying a £189 million transfer fee to terminate the deal, but warned PSG Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational move is the most talked-about affair of the summer; the team in France's Ligue 1 football series is poised to break the world record for transfer numbers; the previous record was less than half lower: It was.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's best-paid professional athlete, with PSG offering him more than £500,000 a week after taxes.
Barcelona are known to be furious at PSG's behaviour and the manner in which Neymar has been forced out of the club; a source close to Barcelona says the club have kept Neymar very well since arriving at Santos in 2013.
Did PSG chair the football world on this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG's best player-seeking clubs.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they are chasing our players, we will become their opponents and contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
'We respect all the clubs.
But if they're chasing our players, they're going to face the consequences. ""
Barcelona appear to be guilty of just that: They expressed interest in PSG's midfield player Marco Silva earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances; it may well be that Barcelona will therefore lose their star player Neymar.

Now: Trump's hefty phone calls were invented - White House spokesman: "I would not say it was a lie"
The White House admits that two phone calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, reports the New York Times.
Trump's suitcase phone calls with both the Mexican president and the head of the patrol organization have proved to be fabricated.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed the calls had not occurred.
But he said Trump did not lie.
According to Sanders, many of the senior figures in the squads spoke to Trump personally, and with Mexican President Enrique PENA Nieto, Trump had spoken at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I would not say it was a lie, it's a pretty tough accusation.
Those conversations happened, they didn't just happen on the phone, but face-to-face, "Sanders reasoned.
Speech to partygoers sparked outcry
On Monday, Trump told the Mexican president to call him and boasted about Trump's success in tackling illegal immigration.
According to Trump, PENA Nieto reported that few will come across Mexico's southern border anymore because they know the trip will in any case be stymied on the U.S. border.
The Mexican government released a statement on Wednesday saying there had been no such phone call.
On Tuesday, Politico released a full version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump slammed his speech at a major meeting of the National Parole Association in West Virginia.
I got a call from the head of the squads, "he said, adding that it was the finest speech ever made to them.
They were very grateful, "Trump reported.
On Wednesday, the patrol organization reported that it wasn't aware of any of its senior staff's phone calls to Trump.
According to the release, an earlier statement from the organization's director, Michael Surbaugh, in which he had apologised for Trump's speech to partisans, speaks to his side.
Mr. Trump's speech at a meeting of the parole organization raised a lot of puzzles, as it was unusually political in the nature of the event.
Among other things, he slammed the results of last autumn's presidential election.
