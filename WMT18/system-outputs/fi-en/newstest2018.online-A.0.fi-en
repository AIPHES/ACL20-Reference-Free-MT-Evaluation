Camille Auer wanted to correct his sex, was diagnosed mentally and now he is doing art on the subject-"man should have the right to his own body"
Dozens of patient stories are hanging from the roof of the Project Room gallery at the Academy of Fine Arts.
Each of them says Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a multi-annual story of how outside people have written their interpretation of the olonets and this identity.
Decided in his turn who he is.
"I wanted to share my personal care history to make the process of violence visible," says Auer.
In the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a period of research that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with a referral to the "Gender identity disorder" diagnostic for studies conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.
The process started four years ago with the Auer.
Even before this, he had used the oestrogens on the internet and was very long in his own repair process.
He felt that he was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must undergo a repair process so that the sex can be remedied legally.
Translaw, that is, the law of transsexual sex (563/2002) obliges transgender people to be forced into sterilisation in order to get the right gender, for example, to the Registry center and passport of the population.
At present, every gender correction requires a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of reproductive incapacity.
People have a right to decide on their own body.
"This situation is unbearable and violates human rights," says Auer.
There has been a long history of translaw reform in Finland.
The UN Human Rights Council has given eight observations and a preliminary ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, which obliges the parties to the ECHR to respect the sovereignty.
The previous Finnish government prepared a change of law under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huveinen.
Came the election and the True Finns boarded the government.
Now the law change is once again stuck.
It is a question of internal political disputes which do not even relate to this law.
"The government does not want to raise it on the table because there are disagreements within the government to change the law," says Frank Johansson, executive director of Amnesty in Finland.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two major installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by the Auer.
In the medical records installation, any visitor can read, for example, at Tampere University Hospital's Transpol psychological interpretation of the Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and, on these basis, wrote a report that should be designated for the maintenance of the Auer's entitlement and assistance.
The reality of the subject appears to be exposed to destabilisation.
The perceived perception of self is shown by a limited-level approach and the unstable features associated with personality are accentuated.
Auer did not recognize himself in these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as a mentally ill," Auer says.
An even greater shock was when no sex repair was granted to the Auer.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to initiate the process.
He was denied his own identity.
Then 11. On February 2015, the Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the Transpol waiting hall for the television.
Later on, the television had a work of art called Monument for the excluded, in which the Auer reflected his experience of power and use.
"It's crazy that anyone with a birth-defined woman can increase their breasts, but breast removal needs a diagnosis," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you experience anything other than the birth of your defined gender.
The experience of the Auer is unfortunately not one of its kind.
For many reasons, the gender correction process is more severe than for purely medical operations.
It is a meeting of dozens of people who have to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It is crazy that people who are in need of support and assistance are denied treatment, claiming that their resources are not enough," Auer says.
Many of the process's applications are behind psychological symptoms: depression, anxiety, potential bullying experiences.
Relying on these, medical staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be initiated.
"Stopping treatment and assistance may plunge man into an even worse situation than it was before the start of the process," Auer says.
The Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, the Auer writes, "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that is something people tend to find hard to digest".
Depression has been treated with medicines and when it was started, the use of hormones was relieved.
He had been able to finally say the sensations that had existed in childhood and teenage years.
Why the wide chin did not seem to fit into your body and why the chest muscles came to be round flat instead of chest.
The important thing is that there are people near him who see him.
There is a basic need for the coming to be seen.
"He is forced to justify so much by talking, dressing, using sound and gestures," he says.
Today, the haze is already being seen, he exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, the random comments of the loved ones could hurt much.
The most hurt is when the close-up misgendered.
"They should know and they know who I am but refuse or cannot assimilate it," he continues.
However, not all transgender persons need physical change.
They do not suffer from body-to-body conflict, where the body or its parts can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and the long research process, there can be no formal confirmation of their gender.
"There is no medical justification for these studies," Auer says.
And that's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for recognising legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in terms of legal sex.
The applicant will submit a written application for a new identity, claiming that it is a different sex.
After a half-year period of reflection, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the ministry gives the applicant a new identity number.
This self-determination is also required in Finland, and this requirement also sums up the exhibition in Auer.
It has not been an artist's therapy experience, but an exhibition of a political and artistic work collection.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political change, at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.
Camille Auer Exhibition at Antiphallic Dick 4.0-28.7.2017 at the Project Room of the Academy of Fine Arts.
The civil rights organisation issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP Association of African American Civil Rights has issued a travel warning on Missouri. The reason is the discriminatory practices of the land and the racist attacks that have taken place there.
"The travel newsletter for Missouri will enter into force 28.8.2017 and invites African American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling In a state where numerous questionable racial events have recently occurred, the Association's bulletin notes.
The law recently entered into force in Missouri hampers the export of cases of discrimination. Moreover, the implementation of the laws of the land disproportionately affects minorities. According to NAACP, these factors led to the issuance of a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are stopped by skin colour and beaten or killed, "says Rod Chapel, president of the Namp Missouri, to the Kansas City Star magazine.
"We have not heard the same number of incidents before in a short time."
A travel newsletter for Missouri is a first warning from the United States state.
The association mentioned the racist comments made against Afro-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of a 28-year old black-and-white Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year. He was driving through the land when his car ran out of fuel. The Missouri police arrested him even though he was not accused of a crime.
The travel newsletter also referred to the statement by the Minister of Justice of Missouri that the police stop the black driver by 75% more likely than the white.
"The purpose of the travel newsletter is to urge people to be alert and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," says Chapel.
"People must be prepared, for example, by involving money for the payment of guarantees or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the land."
According to the FLA, in 2015, a hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri, or Kuudenneksitoista most of the US states.
The travel warning is also an answer to the new Missouri law, which makes it more difficult for companies to challenge discrimination in the right to housing and employment relationships.
Following the recent adoption of immigration laws, which oblige the police to arrest people, the ACLU, a defensive civil rights organisation, has recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona. Maahanmuuttorikkomuksista. According to the association, this increases racial profiling.
Usually travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and they apply to other states. Recently, however, NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Finnair Survey of the Managing Director's supplementary pension from Lintilä
The Minister for Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä (center) has requested a Finnair report on the supplementary pension fee from the airline's CEO Pekka Vaamo, says Yle.
It is, according to the minister, contrary to the will of the state.
The additional pension of EUR 130 000 was raised this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration developments of the directors of listed companies.
Finnish Photo Magazine News of the additional pension in February.
Finnair said he would abandon supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has outlined that no supplementary pensions are used to reward.
The state owns more than half about Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the decision of principle of last year's shareholder guidance.
The sanctions were immediately
Some time ago it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on the way from cold to warm.
In connection with the G20 meeting in Hamburg, President Donald Trump of the United States met and the Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to be coming to terms with one another.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled dramatically.
The new economic sanctions that were signed by the United States Congress last week and endorsed by the trumpet on Wednesday were a bitter response in Russia.
The most striking answer for the time being has been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who says that a ' war on trade ' has been signed by the trumpet.
Even if Russian reactions were to be cleared only as a cause of tension and excesses in political rhetoric, the blackmail of the United States and Russia after the honeymoon of a short trumpet election was a fact.
In the United States, the way through the Sanctions Act on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not straightforward.
However, Congress accepted the law with a considerable degree of unanimity, but, according to the President, the adoption of the law was much trickier.
Trump's criticism of the law, which was recently signed, was "a significant defect".
The fist of President trumpet probably had to be attributed to Russia, although the adoption of a law restricting its own prerogatives must have been objectionable.
As is well known, the United States is investigating both the possible involvement of Russia in the presidential elections and the Russian links in the trumpet campaign.
The tension between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
When the staff of the White House have changed to a strict extent and the various twists and turns have been revealed almost to update, it is becoming increasingly apparent that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States, despite the president's leadership.
Such a situation is in no way desirable.
If the Russian relationship is a kimurant in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's heartland in the Baltic is tightening relations.
The EU has visibly exhibited the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk agreement.
Although the union has so far remained in its policy of Russia, at least on the face of unity, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a much-traded member country like Finland, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The effects of the recent US sanctions Act are still unclear.
The EU has feared that the sanctions will hamper the operation of many European companies.
In Finland the effects may be felt in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, and possibly in the Fenno power plant project.
Acidification in Europe has been caused by the fact that, for example, a liquid natural gas LNG is important for the US economy.
Trade sanctions are a way of showing disapproval in world politics.
However, economic sanctions must be very thoughtful and rigorous.
Otherwise, they will easily do more harm than good.
Is there nothing more sacred?
The White House of the trumpet now has a Statue of Liberty
The absence of the statues is the most very special sign of power change.
The Americans know it as well as everyone else: the Iraqi people, together with American soldiers, were killed by the statue of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the chief ideologists of the trumpet administration, knew very well what he was doing in a fierce debate with Jim Acosta, a CNN channel. The Statue of Liberty was subjected to Miller's attack on Sanharka, the president's proposal to reduce legal migration considerably.
Miller did not really criticise the statue itself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by the huge hordes of cruise organizers and the characters of Freedom statue.
His attack was about the significance of the statue and, in particular, the fact that in 1903 Emma Lazarus's poem was added to the statue's base – 17 years after the statue was finished.
This is how Miller was scared to acbuy: "I do not want to go into it more detail in history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom illuminating the whole world.
The poem was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller was not in itself mistaken, but it is not just about history, as he himself said.
Essential are the touching words of Lazarus, the only kind where the state does not call only immigrants but "the poorest of the poor": "Your tired, your poor,/your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,/The wretched refuse of Your teeming shore."
The poem is now more topical than ever.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism. He made it clear that the "poor poorest" are not welcome to the trumpet in the United States.
The controversy over the significance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural dispute about the United States.
Lazarus's friends campaigned after his death for the poem to be affixed to the statue's tripod. They knew very well that the act was very political.
The purpose of the statue was to embody the links between French and American Republican with a classic metaphor, the feminine incarnation of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: In his poem, the female character is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the exiled mother.
Attaching the poem to the image was an ingenious feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationality.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long been wanting to turn it back to original.
The Rush Limbaugh, which can now be regarded as some kind of a symbol of the trumpet, claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone to call, but is the early pioneer of the neo-conservatives, which takes the United States torch Darkness To disguise the world: "Lady Liberty comes out.
He takes the liberty of torch from the United States to other parts of the world.
The torch does not show the way to the United States. "
Uncommon enough, Limbaugh was partly right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on perspective.
Lazarus saw it like the poor and the weary but hopeful migrants from the ship's deck after a long and afflicted journey.
He saw it as a shelter and a better life for the people looking for.
His Statue of Liberty is comforting by giving hope and welcoming.
and Miller and Trump do not want to.
Their soihtunsa does not show the way, but incithe flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises the British national team for Scottish members
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots were admitted to the British national team
Neil Black, the result director of the UK Athletics Association, says that the 16 Scottish members of the world national team are "significant reinforcement".
A record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for the World Championships in Athletics on Friday.
According to Black, there is something special about Scotland, which British athletics must learn from.
"This is welcome and we will continue to study it until we understand what it is all about," says Black.
"I discussed with representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute and they thought it was related to the Institute's activities.
The Scottish Athletics Federation believes that it is related to the Union's activities,
And the British Athletics Federation believes that they are behind their activities.
And the ordinary Kaduntallaee thinks that he must have something to do with it.
However, it is something quite amazing, which is what it leads to. "
Many Scottish athletes compete in London for serious medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, competing with Sir Mo Farah in 5 000 metres. Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is unnecessarily modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly gorgeous, "Black says.
"Athletes have left the opportunity with pride in their accomplishments and strong motivated, no matter where they live and practice.
The words of Eilidh had a genuine sense of emotion and passion for sport. "
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist of the Commonwealth at the 400 metres hurdles, and these are the fifth World championships. He thinks it is "unbelievable" that the national team has 16 Scots.
The previous record was seven years 1983 and 2015.
The middle distance runner Laura Muir has run five British and two European records during the year.
He competes in London for 1 500 metres and 5 000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs in London for 1 500 meters. You should also keep an eye on him: The man has an excellent season with victories in the UK World Cup qualifiers and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup competition, making the national team's only Scottish addition to him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "immensely proud" of the fact that there are so many Scots, some of which are in serious competition with the final seats and medals.
"It is also a great honour to be a captain, but it is even more special because the members of the national team voted for the captain," Doyle says.
"I am of course very proud of all the Scots who reached the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as athletes, who compete for awards.
Captain's speech?
I think it went just fine.
I focused on how fortunate we are when we have home games.
It is important to enjoy the support of the domestic public and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere becomes insanely gorgeous. "
Blocking critics on Facebook: Do not stand as a candidate for public office if you do not endure criticism
The father of our country knew what was bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began criticising him for all his possible domestic politics, always in his political principles.
The critique certainly annoyed,
But he did not silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is lifted, we may be led to be foolish and quiet as sheep for slaughter," Washington said in 1783.
That brings us to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their presenters.
The American Civil Rights Federation challenged the Hogan court earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge to be unfounded, and the attitude was also dismissive on the web.
"What does it matter? This is just Facebook, "many people commented.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of the state Democrats.
He has received the second best estimates from his activities 50 among the governors.
Hogan is not responsive to hot dip.
He has led the state firmly and insisted on principles.
He has also made a skilful use of Facebook as the main channel of communication with his voters and published a picture of the kaljuuntuneesta in chemotherapy therapy.
Therefore, blocking users from the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum, which his staff maintains with tax money.
Hogan spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's action on Washington Post's interview. He said it was just a question of moderation.
However, stamping out commentators, spammers or whistles is too easy to solve.
The Washington Post interviewed the users of Hogan on Facebook.
They proved to be normal people who wanted to discuss with their chosen leaders. They were not trolleja, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They told us that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and factual.
The pastor quoted his comment on the Bible; He wanted to invoke the Catholic faith of Hogan.
Mr. Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland was not hostile, but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I comment politely that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a position on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in the Washington Post's news comments.
"Nor can I accept the fact that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately considered to be organised in some way and are dismissed as a large group of anxious citizens."
The governor's staff invited the comments into a "centralised attack". Someone else could call them to promote important issues.
In the Facebook era, it's easy to manage communication by blocking a reviewer or deleting a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers that had published critical writings, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But it really is about the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public authority to be accused of wading through Facebook and other social media channels.
The Twitter users who have been blocked by President trumpet have challenged him to justice.
This subject was the first major decision last week in Virginia.
According to the judge of Alexander the District Court, James C. Cacheris, the Government of Loudoun violated the first addition of the United States Constitution in blocking the voter on Facebook.
And the American Civil Rights Federation went on to talk with Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin for using Twitter and Facebook.
This should not be difficult.
At the time of Washington, the cost of postal charges had a similar effect to that of the internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and the anonymous writers went on to hammer out Washington.
Even then there were the Trolleja.
The nickname Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters in the newspapers in which they were barking at the decisions of Washington.
The presidential office was flooded with petitions criticising the Jay Agreement, the cooperation, trade and maritime Agreement between the United States and Britain. This is evident from the documents collected in the papers of George Washington Web project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be discontinued immediately
The samples have come from about thirty places, plus online announcements from the couple, three.
The majority of them have come from south and southwest Finland, but then also individual from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, senior researcher Marja Isomursu Evasasta says.
Greenfinches have died of a parasitic disease called trikomonosis.
It is created by a scientific name called Trichomonas Gallinae.
It has previously been known to strike pigeons, and especially to the dilemma.
However, in the 2000-century the disease began to be observed with chaffinch birds.
In 2009 it was very good.
In that case, tricomonosis caused a big collapse in the Finnish greenfinches, after which the species ' strains have been recovering.
The diseased greenfinches have now been, but at least not yet on a big scale, says Juha Honkala, the Museum of Natural Sciences at the University of Helsinki (creation).
It is to be feared that the previous epidemic of greenfinches will renew again, unless something is done.
What you have to do now is a very simple thing to do for everyone: Stop the summer feeding of birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home ground to represent the Renaissance club
The former European number Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home ground for the next three days, while the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organizes its 25th. Scottish Senior Open Tournament.
Rafferty, the Northern Ireland, headed a tournament in the Archerfield Links field last year before the final round but eventually lost to Paul Ealfore. Rafferty is fond of new location and serves as the tournament envoy for the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadin.
"I watched the building of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it gets to full glory," Rafferty says.
"Players will see the field at their best. It is in a wonderful condition.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He is an avid ambassador to the game, and he is proud of his achievements here.
The tournament is a fantastic introduction to this field. "
The Englishman Eales defended the title for the first time, despite having won a European Tour and a European challenger in his 32-year career.
"This seems like a very special event," says the player who lives in Southport.
"I could not defend the victory of Extremadura, because the tournament does not belong to the tour this year.
Here is a fabulous return.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come to mind: Tournament victory was a great thing for me and my wife, Sharon.
It was a wonderful time, which we will always remember. "
Gary Orr returns to the action on his own soil. He went along for a tour, having completed his earlier this year for 50 years.
This is her first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open Tournament.
"Home play is always more meaningful," says Orr, a resident of Helsburgur.
"You want to succeed but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and played pretty strongly.
I'm happy with my game so far. "
The trio will be accompanied by the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the seniors major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNultyn.
The tournament will be attended by six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup-captain Sam Torrance, and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Car parking costs Five pounds if your car has only a driver, and ten pounds if your car has at least two people.
All proceeds are donated to the Prostate Cancer UK Cancer Association.
In Säjärvi, a possible indoor air
In Säkjärvi, the Pori Brigade's message to the company's barracks building has not so far found indoor air problems, the brigade was told on Thursday.
Internal aviation studies continue.
The studies began when, for health reasons, the military service had interrupted the man's brother-in-
According to the Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, Lieutenant-Colonel Mika Holman, the health situation of other servicors has not been identified.
It turned out that this was an isolated case, and there have been no health problems for other units in the unit.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this matter thoroughly.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any internal aviation problem, Holma says.
The Brigade Bulletin says that, because of the arrival of July, the barracks must have been transferred, which may have led to a momentary increase in dust.
The air may have seemed to be a sentimental, Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Gold Country
Bardina Degoi does not use in cooking a gentle diet.
The cat's broad use is rarely used.
Degei lives in the wooden building in Enarotali, the capital of the Panain region, which is located in the troubled Papua province of Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the sweet potatoes – locally "Nota" – directly into the fire instead.
After half an hour, the burnt sweet potato is eaten away with bare, unwashed hands.
There are no furniture in the home of Degein. He is sitting in a muddy painting, where he usually also manages his daily chores, like washing them in the cloudy water that was washed from the nearby marshes.
The toilet posts are supplied by a bucket in a vanishing room.
Degei is the youngest of four wives of her husband, and he has not been assigned to the fields.
Polygamy is here in general.
Late working can be dangerous: most of the village's men are unemployed, and many drink a lot. We also need to take into account the soldiers.
"No one dares to walk in the village after five o'clock in the evening," Degoi says.
This is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the Papuan Highlands, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. This was preceded by a controversial referendum, in which 1 026 the German public was forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed the Dutch power, quickly turned his wrath on the government of Jakarta, which keeps the region under control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is a peripheral and a dreary. The journey starts with a one and a half hour flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabree and continues on the belly of a five-hour ride on a rented car.
There is no public transport here.
With around 19 000 inhabitants, there are wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, which have been stained with a yellowish brown corrugated sheet.
Only a few people in Indonesia have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Prior to the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Papuan me Pago-Theimans worshipped the UGA Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have such clothes," Degoi says. He means colourful, hand-woven kietaisupäähinettään, dark skirt and a bright coloured pouch.
"Before we had only a leaf in the blanket of our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia. 28% of its population live below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also an Indonesian golden land.
Paniai is a plateau area of approximately New jersey, with 153 000 inhabitants. Only about a hundred kilometers from the panics of Grasberg, the world's largest and most proceeds gold mine. It is owned by Freeport McMoRan, a company established in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine produced a total of 3.1 billion dollars worth of gold and copper for the freegate.
In addition, Papua has an estimated 78 billion in wood reserves.
However, these riches are the misery of the Papians, as they mean the repressive presence of the strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military personnel and army local units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004. The individual officers were paid up to $150 000.
The demands of Papua for greater self-determination threaten this source of income, and they are being silenced by mercy.
According to human rights activists, after 1969, the Indonesian Army has killed over 500 000 papered and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, a group of killings in the Papua tribal Highlands in the 1970 century received the proportions of the genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested an area of more than 3 900 people in peaceful demonstrations.
In the report by Brisbane's archdiocese, We will lose Everything dating back to 2016 reports on the atrocities of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – rape and electrocution are particularly popular means – and Draconian attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"Counting the number of victims is difficult because there are cases on a weekly basis," says Andreas Harsono, Human Rights Watch, Indonesian researcher.
The screws are tightened when the natural resources of Papua are attracting migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants, 83% are Christians, but the demographic structure is changing when Indonesian people from the islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi are changing Muslims in the hope of a better livelihood.
The Javanese warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable mixture in peanut sauce.
Locals find it hard to compete.
"The movers have started to sell chicken and vegetables on the market at a lower price than the locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who hails from panics and moved to the provincial capital after work.
"The local women lost their customers."
The President of Indonesia, either Widado – nicknamed Jokowi – promised in his 2014 election campaign to tackle the injustices and human rights abuses in Papua.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former Carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Panaissa, on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts were shattered because we voted for Jokoso in 2014 and we waited for him to fulfill our desires and restore justice," You said.
The panic was experienced only two months after the October inauguration of Jokow.
Eleven children were singing carols at the campfire in Enarotalin 7.12.2014, when two Indonesian soldiers were released from the dark on motorcycles.
Frightened children said to the soldiers that they should use headlights.
One of the soldiers did not like the remark. According to the local pastor, Yavedt Tebain, the man returned to the scene with four soldiers.
According to the victims ' and witnesses ' reports, the drunken soldiers took the children to catch up and assaulted these rifles.
Thus, one of the soldiers shot towards the children.
One of the children, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of the assault.
A couple of hours later, the state Electoral committee near the venue was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand beans – young men and women and children – gathered in front of the football pitch to call for the right to the local police station and the Army Command Centre.
They were accompanied by hunting strings for the ceremony, and they began to present the traditional Waita dance of the Papuan me Pago, which danced on the ring and traced the bird's singing.
Some of the demonstrators began to stone the police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere became hot, the soldiers got a commandment in the internal radio system: "If the crowds are resisting more than three times, please shoot them death." The information is based on an official document from TIME magazine that has not been published to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto region, foresetook the situation out of control and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot on my left wrist," he told the TIME magazine on the porch of his brightly coloured wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who was shooting him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
"A lot of shots were shot in the crowd."
Alfius Youwia shot three times. His cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was indeed he," told Yohanes TIME magazine a tragedy. Like many Indoneans, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him. "
The Papuan police Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that the cops only "protected" the police station because it was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papuan police spokesman Pujo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"Then it's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many were injured.
The day after the death of the information was in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Mr Jokowi, in Jayapura, held an emotional speech expressing condolences to the families of the victims and promised that the violence in Papua would be tackled.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that it never happens again."
The security minister, Mr Wieland, said in October 2016 that he would initiate reports on human rights abuses outside the legal system.
However, he began to cancel his speeches immediately.
"Most of the violations happened a long time ago,
In the 1990 and early 2000 century.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate violations, but it requires certain processes, "he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta 5.6.2017 the Wianto had already changed his mind. He said he did not intend to start explanations in Papua.
"Everything is cleared in court," he told.
The UN is blaming the Wieland for ' crimes against humanity '. The offences relate to the death of more than a thousand people in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999. Wilanto said to TIME magazine that eleven cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been clarified, including the events of Panain.
The families of the panain victims are in a dark distrust of the allegations.
"I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," says Yohanes.
"I'm already tired of this."
He says he still lives in fear, even though the incident has been around for years.
"Yes I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army is arresting me. I'm afraid I'm being shot. "
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panians do not dare to discuss the incident.
He tells us that the soldiers had battered him when he had helped bury four of the victims.
"Soldiers are looking for me to hold their hands after burying the victims," he says.
Ampuations are not exhausted.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired villagers Panain in the neighboring district of Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between villagers and the manager of a construction company, which originated when the director refused to take the men who lost his sense of the hospital. There were also children among the injured.
The man needed to be hospitalized was a 24-year-old trot, Douw, who had been on the water while fishing in the nearby river. He died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers showed their protest at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned police officers who responded by warning shots.
However, according to locals, the Indonesian police unit of the paramilitary police opened fire to the crowd, when one villager was killed.
"We are terrified. We fear revenge, "says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw when the wounded were brought to care.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyain Parliament has called for the police to be held accountable and the withdrawal of the rolling police unit from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds the dissatisfaction of the Me, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the lush central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papuan Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Papians by random attacks and kidnapping of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the directors of OPM are panicked, such as the Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arresting and arresting thousands of people arbitrarily in the name of ' safeguarding national sovereignty '.
Some of those arrested will never go back.
Among the bean subordinates, Paniai is known as "a sad, forgotten place."
Poverty breeds dissatisfaction.
There is only a small amount of rice for sale in Enarotalk, and that too is too expensive for the locals,
Like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Cultivation is a women's work, and one woman's responsibility may be four or five sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold at the marketplace.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10 000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the disparities between local and migrant livelihoods have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened at Nabiren Airport.
There are few jobs and they usually go to the local level for better educated and wealthier migrants.
Only a few beans have enough capital and know-how to run their own businesses competitively.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Panain Tribe Council.
Remote Papua remains in the world for little attention.
In addition, the restrictions on international news coverage remain stringent.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basle Longchamp were expelled from Papua, even though they had been granted a rare description of the permit. The official reason was the inability to co-operation with local institutions.
According to the Asian deputy director of the Human Rights Watch, Phelim Kinen, Jokowi has not kept his election promises. He has not increased transparency and has not contributed to the development by removing the restrictions on news coverage.
"In Indonesia's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua, news journalists have new risks: refusal of visas and blacklisting", Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom to operate the press means that the Indonesian government is only pressuring the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' numerous and widespread violations of Papua ', including the attack on the Panain.
Traditionally, these countries have also supported the liberation movement of Papua.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the accusations and told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to disguise the evidence of human rights abuses".
The locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When a Dutch official delegation, headed by the human rights envoy, Kees Van Bar, visited Jayura 4.5.2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, telling the meeting was a permanent source of anonymity.
There is a presidential election in Indonesia 2019, but the bean subordinates tell us that we are no longer likely to vote for Jokoso.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who are entangled in the attack of Panain," says Gobai, president of the Tribe Council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Panians: they are living under the greedy and unpredictable army under the rule of deprivation and poverty, practically without health care services and educational opportunities.
Gobain says that Panians, like other Papians, attach their voices to Jokowski as a "debt" that has to be repaid.
"They don't want money. They just want justice, "he says.
Despite intimidation and intimidation, the victims of the Panain shooting scene once again demonstrated resistance metaphorically: they buried one of the victims in a country opposite the police station and the military branch.
They know that they may never have the right, but at least they will not be responsible for forgetting their crimes.
"My family was slain," Yacobus says in the head of the press.
"What else could we do?"
Dereck Chisora barks for Robert Helenius ' re-match cancellation: "Even my own fans don't want to see"
The heavy heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were to be Otella on 27 September. May be in the Hartwall Areena.
However, the match was canceled for commercial reasons.
In an interview with ITIL TV, Chisora is passing a replay of the cause of the rematch, completely Helenius.
My match in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans do not want to see his nerve, because he is miserable, and the Chisora is very rough.
Helenius and Chisora first met at the full Hartwall Areena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match at a controversial point-of-judgment.
The re-match ticket sales went smoothly, and its promoter, Nisse Sauerland, told the evening message in May that the match was postponed until autumn.
There was nothing new about the match.
However, the cancellation is no longer a bother Chisora.
The match would probably have to be cancelled in any case by the sufferers of Chisora.
On Thursday, three days before the match time, I woke up to a hard pain.
My guns were exploding.
The hospital said that I should be cut, says Chisora.
The British says that they are currently in the order of 45%.
He is not interested in the rematch with Helenius, but in the sights of the Dillian Hyte.
In December, Chisora suffered a loss in the last few votes.
The fire was captured again by the Torch skyscraper in Dubai
The Flames captured the world's tallest residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee the 337 metres high 79-storey building.
This was already the second fire within two years of the building, whose name happens to be a torch, torchlight.
The building was cleared and nobody is known to be injured. Because of the fire there was no perception immediately after the event.
"We were asleep and woke up with a fire alarm loud and on people's cries.
We ran stairs down to 50. On the floor, which took me ten minutes, "George's resident told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Rescue forces, the fire troops were able to shut down the four-morning local time and stayed cooling the building.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for its homes.
The case can re-raise questions about the safety of materials used on outer surfaces of tall buildings around the world.
After a fire in 2015, the Board of the Torch Building commissioned a study to see that the most damaging plates used for façade cladding and isolation were found.
In Britain, the police believe that the insulation and cladding plates of Grenfell Tower in London could contribute to the rapid progression of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.

In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers take out prohibited items, disclose a survey
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unknowingly exported prohibited items to aeroplanes past the US Transport Safety Agency (TSA) Checkpoints. At least 6% of the passengers had knives or other objects in the blade which they did not know to be banned.
Less than one per cent said that they had received only afterwards to know that they had mistakenly transported weapons, ammunition or explosives.
More than a thousand passengers were surveyed, and it was implemented by Stratos Jet charters. The results also reveal that young travellers are more likely to defy the rules.
Of the travellers consciously involved in the TSE, 19.7% were representatives of the Y generation and less than 15% belonged to generation X.
Most commonly, the rules were broken by exporting the aircraft to food and liquids.
More than three percent of the exported-equipped objects were consciously admitted to the aircraft. In addition, 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men reported that exported banned drugs were consciously on the plane.
The survey was attended by passengers from all over the United States. The poll taken by the company wanted to find out how many had exported the smuggling goods accidentally past the security check and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that most travellers also take the smuggling goods most likely past the security check – knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the poll made by the company notes, the Tsan guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids an airplane can take and how much.
It is therefore no surprise that most of the seizures of the TSE are liquids.
For some time there was also the belief that no books could be exported to the aeroplane.
Liquids may be exported for domestic flights but not for international flights.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency director Scott Pruitt Swirt of decision to delay Obama's period decisions to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states had sued the US EPA leader Scott Pruitti, Pruitt withdrew its earlier decision to delay the reduction in emissions of fumes from the Obama administration Implementation of the decisions.
According to Pruitti, the amendment shows that the agency he manages takes greater account of the needs of the Länder's environmental policy makers than the previous administrations.
Pruitt did not mention in a word the action which was brought against his previous decision before the federal appeals court.
The Länder should start complying with the 2015 requirement level 1.10 for ozone at the earth level. From.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would move the decisions by one year forward, so that his agency has more time to familiarise himself with the plan, because the agency ' does not want to interfere in local decision-making or hinder economic growth '.
Pruitt was a Oklahoma State prosecutor before President Donald Trump appointed him as the director of the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
After his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly attempted to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical industry and the fossil fuels industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback for the Pruittin plan to mitigate the provisions.
The federal appeals court in Washington last month issued a decision that the director of the EPA exceeded its powers in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's decision on the oil and gas companies. The decision obliged companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In an opinion on Wednesday evening Pruitt argued that his full translation of ozone regulations only strengthens the EPA's cooperation with the Länder in a complex process aimed at fulfilling the new requirements; Schedule.
"In previous administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with deadlines and then waited for the activist groups and others to challenge its justice in which to reach agreement schedules," Pruitt said. He challenged the environmental agency in his previous activity more than ten times.
"We do not believe in legal regulation and we take the deadlines seriously.
We are also serious about the regulation on our activities and the powers it has for us. '
However, the EPA's opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to use "its powers to delay the enforcement of decisions and other legal powers" in order to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available Information ".
The Republicans advocate a greater change in ozone regulations in Congress.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions for at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
The New York State prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who was challenged by the state consortium that was sued by the EPA this week, reported that the Group intends to continue the pressure.
"The result of our change of mind in the EPA is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the effects of smog in their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York City In addition to the action included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ozone in the ground occurs when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical factories, for example, respond to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause severe respiratory sensitized groups of people with difficulty breathing. It is also a contributing factor to thousands of premature deaths each year.
The promoters of public health and environmentalists rejoiced at the surprising change of direction.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required to ensure that the guy responsible for our breath was using common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for biodiversity.
"We must continue to fight against the trumpet administration, because its ideological aim is to act on the terms of the polluters and other groups of its own interests."
The super car manufacturer becoming a SUV-"takes place in Ferrari style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars, while at the same time trying to keep up with its exclusive status.
This is likely to happen, but it happens in Ferrari's style, chief executive Sergio Marchionne said at the plans briefing on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be unveiled next year when an Italian supercar manufacturer presents his new five-yearly plan, Automotive News News.
All East Savo Measles cases of the same virus type
The Rantasalmi measles infection has the same type of virus as East Savonia's previous cases, informing THL.
The health and well-being of the Department of Virology Laboratory has verified on Thursday that Eastern Savonia 5th measles infection is the same virus strain with previous infections.
THL has made sure that beach Salmelaisan person on Friday 28. In July, a confirmed measles infection is the same type of virus as previous eastern Savo cases.
Based on this information, all the infections observed in eastern Savo relate to the first ash-carotene found in the region in June.
The news is good because it means that we have not come up with other measles virus types.
However, it is possible that, after the fifth outbreak, new infections may occur until mid-August, and the epidemic is therefore not over yet, the doctor responsible for the communicable diseases of Soster, Mirkamleena Erkkilä says.
New cases of measles infestation or their suspicions have not emerged after the fifth confirmed case.
It is still important, however, that everyone takes care of the timeliness of their own vaccination protection, Erkkilä recalls.
More on this subject: three new measles infections were confirmed in Pirkanmaa-"additional infections or an epidemic very unlikely"
Finland prepares for a promising kilju making
Pontikan soup was not even considered to be legalized.
The underlying criterion is that the process produces spirits along with methanol, which is toxic.
Making a Kiljun at home is legal next year, but the legalization of Pontikan soup is not even considered.
The Kilju is produced by fermentation, and moonshine is distilled.
The reason for the distillation regulation is that the process produces a methanol which is poisonous, along with the Viina.
There has been no political will to adjust the soup of Ponkan to Everyman's right, the Government counsellor Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry prepared the Reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of Pontikan was not considered to be legalized.
The issue was not brought to the political table either.
There was no debate on the release of the distillation, Member of Parliament Outi Mäkelä (ECR).
He is a party to the parliamentary groups of government parties who took a position on the reform of the alcohol law.
The authorisation for the distillation of Pontika's home can continue to be granted even on application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
Tuominen says that the home manufacture of alcoholic beverages becomes a simple rule: alcohol may be manufactured at home through fermentation.
This means that, in addition to beer, cider and wine, the home can also be legally made.
The government has wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law eliminates the requirements for flavouring substances and makes it possible to make a Kilju, Mäkelä focuses.
The manufacturing process must be carried out in such a way that the raw materials or the flavouring and flavourings created during their fermentation are clearly visible.
Under the new law, drinks may be prepared for themselves as much as they want, and self-made alcohol can be given as a gift.
For sale It must still not be put.
The race is no longer a public health problem in Finland, the importing believes.
A much larger change occurred on 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now in the Ministry of Justice to be audited.
The Law on alcohol will be handled by the Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law shall enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if Parliament had already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was climbed to the hospital by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from breast pain, was climbed to the South African hospital for the suspicion of a heart attack.
Pistorius has already gotten out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius suffers prison sentence in Atteridgeville prison.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to a hospital this morning, escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pains, but he was removed from the hospital in the afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to hospital for studies.
The Pistorus family spokesman, meanwhile, reported that the former elite athlete is in order.
Last summer, the Supreme Court condemned the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp for six years in prison.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
The transcribed telephone conversations reveal the Mexican pressure in the building of a border wall
The transcripts of the telephone conversations between U.S. President Donald trumpet and Mexican and Australian leaders have been leaked to Washington post.
In a telephone conversation with 27.1.2017, Trump urged the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, to end his public speech not to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States has swallowed the fact that this had knocked the wall of the project in public. "You can't say so to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall at the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a transcribe call to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. During the call there was a tense exchange of words.
Trump said to the Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take on refugees travelling to Australia is ' ridiculous ', ' lousy ' and ' silly '. According to the trumpet, the agreement negotiated during the Obama period would give him the "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump stopped the call by saying to the Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call all day."
Georgian massacre: Activists re-staged racist lynkery in the hope of justice
The Ford Mercury-branded car bypasses the crowd in the small town of Monroen in the Georgian countryside and continues its journey towards the small bridge of Moore's Ford.
The car has four black passengers and a white driver. Four armed men are blocking the road before the car gets to the bridge.
The leader of a group, raidalliseen dressed in a middle-aged man, takes a deep breath from his cigar and tils through the windscreen.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, N---u!" man Äykäisee.
"Out of the car!"
The screams violate silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
This shocking event is fortunately just a restaging, aired on 22.7.2017.
However, the shock is genuine when the noose is threaded into the "Roger's" neck.
Since 2005, the human rights organisations have returned to the bridge of Moore's Ford to reconnect the events of the year 1946. At the time, the Ku Klux Klan Lynch two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been prosecuted for the murders.
"It's confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – even though the murderers are living among us and many people need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the reorganization of the rearrangement.
"It is a blot on history, but above all it is a burden that weighs our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian congressman.
Her restaging is a startling call to action. It also reminds the people of Monroen that the injustice has never been rectified.
"We want the perpetrators to be subjected to justice. We want things to finally be completed, and we want to recover from grief and reconciliation, but above all we want justice, "Brooks says.
"We cannot recover and reconcile before we get justice."
The medical examiner covers the body of the victim who died in Georgia's massacre 27.7.1946.
According to the Fbi's documents received by the NBC News, Lynch was suspected of having more than 50 men in the Monrosta and surrounding counties.
However, no one was accused of murder.
Although the culprits have been free for decades, activists have been aware of the fact that the motives of lynktism have been known to the local: Politics and sex.
In 1946, the state of Georgia black-and-white received the Supreme Court's decision to vote for the first time in presidential elections. The Supreme Court issued its decision in April, and the elections took place in the summer.
According to the FLA, an incident occurred at the time of the elections in which the black-and-white tenant, Roger Malcom, stabbed the white-skinned landowners, Barnett Hester, in a fight, which apparently concerned Malcom's wife, Dorotha.
According to Brooks, the town was rumored to have had a relationship with Dorothyn and that Dorothy waited for this child.
According to the Fbi's information, the influential white-land owner, Loy Harrison, paid 25.7.1946 Malcom's 600, against which he was released from prison.
On his way home, Malcom and Dorothn were accompanied by their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford's Bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and organised the murders," the Fbi's report states.
"It is also evident that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities. The authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses. "
Brooks expresses the matter more succinctly.
"It was the voice of the right to murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to communicate to the black people that they were doing the same if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directed by the Georgian massacre for almost a decade.
The presentation is extremely realistic and captivating. It is a description of the tragic racism that many people would like to believe has already disappeared from today's United States.
It is difficult to look at the proposal, but it is even more difficult to see what is meant by Greene.
"We don't want to talk about Lynkter, because we're going to have to face the dark side of us," says the director.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you can't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been experiencing."
This year's performance rehearsal began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen black and twenty white – met to listen to Greene's rustinated summary of the show.
Wade Marbaugh is the assistant director of Greene.
He has been presenting the local leader of the Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always equally difficult and obnoxious.
"There will be a dirty feeling because I'm not myself," Marbaugh explains.
"It is important, however, that even this aspect of history is seen so that it never happens again."
The other side of the room is Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, known as Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The performance begins with a scene in which Malcom screams and Tönii Hester. He is furious that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothyn.
"Did you hear? I said that exit my mail, n---u! "
The Rascona, or Hester, is responsible.
Then leaves the punch.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughs hardest.
"What?!" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally get too loud?" he asks.
"Et", Greene Hekotaa.
"I just don't think the whites used the word n---u."
"So," another black-and-white actress confirms.
"It's slang. You need to use a longer version. "
The subject of the presentation is uncomfortable, but the room invades the guy's spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the presentation. They want to honour the memory of those killed.
The scene starts from the beginning.
Now Rasconan's words are siimmense.
No one will laugh.
The restaging stops quickly and violently.
Shouting, shots – and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral is standing by the bodies and sings the Strange Fruit song by Billie Holiday.
His voice is shattered by another word.
Some ten feet from about fifty spectators wipe their eyes with sweat and tears.
Almost exactly half of the audience is black and half white.
There is a couple who have come to see the show from Ithaca, New York, but most of them are local.
They have had the guidance of Brooks on the graves of the victims in Georgia's pressure-loving wetlands.
Murder has changed from story to reality. The atmosphere of the event spot is heavy.
After the song's presentation, Greene invites the crowd to check the bodies.
Children are squat to watch artificial blood and motionless bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mumbles like to remind himself.
After a few minutes, Greene commends the audience.
The actors in the lynklers are stripping their cloak and wiping tears.
Bradshaw Hug Marbaughia, the local man who performed the Ku Klix Klan.
Nick Rascona hug Two actresses and then bursts into tears after the hard show.
"No worries," the woman involved in the presentation.
"We know that you are not he.
You did this for good reason. "
Later, the crowd and the actors meet for a common dinner.
The white couple in Altanta is busy discussing the show with their black couple.
Denise Duplinski finds it hard to find words when she describes the sensations that the presentation has aroused.
"It's hard to listen to awful words and watch the awful deeds that you say and make people who look the same as you – just because they look the same as you," he says.
"I was made aware that lynkthings still happen," he added. "They are just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for the listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started the design of next year's presentation.
"The redesign is a powerful experience, as it depicts the horrors we are experiencing, but it is also an educational experience," Brooks says.
"The message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it. "
Vegetable Riipiminen shops are castrated: this degree of removal of "redundant parts" actually saves
Is it permissible to remove cauliflower leaves already in the shop before weighing?
How about taking pineapple out of a big hat-it weighs no matter how much?
The answers share the views strongly: for the single, it is a sign of the extreme nuttering, while others do not want to pay for the parts of the vegetable that are not used and which, however, go to the home as a garbage.
The phenomenon is recognized in stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-CityMarket, a vegetable department in Helsinki, because many people rip the cabbage leaf parts.
From the box, the leaves are exported to bio waste.
According to the news published in the financial messages, the shopkeepers wonder about the merchants.
But how much does removing the extra parts of vegetables before weighing actually save you money?
How important is the Nuendo?
We women tested how the price changes when pineapple, globe artichokes, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower take their leaves or stocks away from them.

Neymar was bought out of Barcelona-Brassithti signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, says the news agency AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a 222 million off-the-line buy-in for FC Barcelona in the Spanish league football.
The huge transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in the history of football.
In the past, the record was at Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million from French Paul Poul.
The Spanish league held a brake on the transfer earlier on Thursday, rejecting the first payment company of the Neymar representatives.
According to the league's rules, the buying club cannot pay the price of the purchase directly to the seller, but the player has to buy out his contract, which is by recycling through the Money League.
In practice, the PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives, who submitted via the Money League to Barcelona.
Neymarin is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will be presented to a new home audience at the PSG season opening against Amisisia on Saturday.
Uefa examines the details
In addition, Barcelona announced that it would provide information on the levy to the European Football Federation UEFA, so that the alliance can determine the disciplinary measures that might be caused by the case.
For example, the Spanish league president, Javier Tebas, has doubted the use of the Financial fair game rules of Uefa in the conduct of the PSG.
Uefa can punish the monitors that will make over three years more than 30 million euros in losses.
According to UEFA, the transfer of Neymar does not automatically violate its financial clauses.
Neymar's transfer to the PSG will affect the club's economy for several years, but the effect cannot be estimated beforehand.
For example, PSG may sell several players in substantial amounts, Uefa was informed.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatar company Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former tennis professional, Nasser Al-Khelaifi from Qatar.

EPA spins its decision to defer implementation of the smog rules
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has decided to delay the implementation of decisions on emissions of smog, which were made by the Obama administration, the day after 15 states had challenged the agency to court.
On the late Wednesday, the EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called "ozone specification" in 2015. According to the agency, the decision demonstrates its commitment to cooperating with the Länder.
"We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the Länder," said Scott Pruitt, director of the agency's opinion.
In June, Pruitt announced the agency's intention to defer the implementation of ozone specifications by one year to October 2018. According to specifications, smog pollution is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollutants need to be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the agency challenged Justice to 15 main Democrats in the ruled state, including the District of Columbia. They suggest that the postponement of the implementation was illegal.
President Donald Trumpet's administration has sought ways to mitigate the environmental regulations of Barack Obama. According to trumpet, the measures are part of a broader programme for economic growth.
The trumpet measures have resisted Democrats and environmentalists who are worried about the increase in emissions from health effects.

Because of the alleged terrorist plans, four men were caught in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but also his questioning continues.

Vasyl Lomathenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the near future of a series of less than 66.7 kilos of the most interesting boxing match, were on Thursday for the first time.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN Sports channel office in Los Angeles, until the WGC's unbeatable light-heavyweight champion Mikey Garcia walked along the aisle to greet Lomathenkoa, The WB's senior featherweight champion.
On Saturday, Garcia won the former four-weight world champion, the master, with a unanimous decision. Since then, Garcia and Lomathenko have been among the top five in the range of boxers in the comparative list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and asked, "How goes, Master?
Good luck with the match! "
Lomathenko defends his title against Miguel Marriag on ESPN on the seventh Saturday.
When the duo posed for photographers, Lomašenko's manager Egis Klimas pointed out that the match between men would be "perfect for size".
"I'm a former featherweights," Garcia recalled.
"I moved into a series of higher [63.5 pounds] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a small 63.5 kg.
I want to back the light series.
He has to rise to a light series [61.2 pounds]. Then we can otella.
That is what our fans are hoping for.
Meet their wishes. "

It will be a great match. "
Average salary 5 300 euros, training what hurts-investment advice The situation was "wild and free"
The quality of the investment advice has spoken a lot lately.
Most recently, the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper told the company, 68, to whom the investment advisor in the banker was talking about a full-nonsense in selling investment products.
The rules governing investment advisors and the sale of different investment products will become stricter at the beginning of next year.
The tightening up will be based on the new financial market directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
At the present moment, the assessment of the skills of the investment advisors and the employees who sell them is based mainly on self-regulation.
The law does not define skills requirements.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service carry out their own APV1 or APV2 qualification.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of the diplomas in APV-Investment graduates Ltd, whose degree in the Working group sits in both the financial supervision (Fiva), the universities and the industry's experts.
The degrees are of a magnitude of 12-15 credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto University Executive Education Ltd., a wave of management development services.
It is reported on the website that, generally speaking, both exams are "quite extensive in terms of requirements".
The teaching materials of the diplomas include 10-15 books as well as numerous other guides and works.
The managing director of APV-investment graduates, Markku Savikko, says that the exam rate is roughly 70.
Of the largest banks, roughly all of the investment services have completed either a APV1 or a APV2 qualification, since their performance is compulsory according to their own rules.
Then there are the smaller brokerage companies, without mentioning names, whose staff are affected by the execution of the map qualifications, says Savikko.
According to him, such brokers are "a few".
According to Saviko, APV1 graduates from 2000 to 13 000-14 000 and more demanding investment advisors APV2 around 3 000 people.
Some brokerage companies consider the qualification to be a benefit.
Several other sectors have considerably stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that the financial sector recommendation will require the completion of APV qualifications, because that is where investment-related competence is assured.
According to the statistics centre, financial and Investment advisors earn a monthly average of several thousand euro commissions, including fringe benefits and income commissions.
The average earnings per month for regular working hours are approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men working in positions earn over EUR 5 900 per month and more than 4 500 euro respectively.
The most earning Tiys earns an average of about 8 100 euros.
For the most earning men, Tiys earns more than 9 000 euros per month or more, the most earning women in one tenth earn 6 400 euros or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be issued by a company with a service.
The employee and task level has hitherto been trusted by self-regulation.
According to Fiva, the audit that it carried out received individual cases in which the professional skills and qualifications of the investment advisor were not sufficient on the basis of the advice of the facilitator.
The sale of investment products can also, in principle, work, even if the skills and qualifications are at a very hectic level.
In principle, the situation has been wild and free.
More than any other industry has considerably stricter skills requirements, says Savikko.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened with the new Financial market directive (MiFID).
It requires each company to be responsible for the fact that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently skilled.
Financial supervision may, in turn, have the power to prescribe what needs to be know.
Mr Marko Hovi, the market supervisor of Fiva, says that one of the clear changes to the present is that of the competence and experience requirements of the sellers of investment advisors and investors.
According to Hovi, the new requirements apply to both the own staff of investment firms and tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
The court tells us that, according to the Government of the Treasury, the Fiva may be empowered to prescribe knowledge and experience.
What exactly they are, will be decided in the coming autumn.
In the future, the company must also take care of the necessary training and, where necessary, follow-up and refresher training.
All this is to be documented, and the company has a duty to monitor that this has also been done.
The court specifies that in practice the company must, for example, map out the staff's job descriptions at the individual level.
This will certainly be subject to different requirements, depending on whether it is an investment advisor or a product sale.
According to Hovi, it is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced if there is not sufficient knowledge or experience.
That is, if a company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the specified criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the specified time criteria.
According to Hovin, the change will tighten and embody the rules.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of 2018.

The Unknown Soldier sells toilet brushes-"This is a unifying story"
All sorts of things you see.
A blue product that produces cleaning products was launched a few days ago by the Unknown Soldier series.
I mean the washing-up brushes and the clothes racks-and the "toilet brush on the brush."
The Unknown Soldier refers to the film that premiered in the fall and the marketing of Leffa.
Yet there is something special about the mix, and the products are being irvitty on social media: When will the unknown-health links?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What is said by Aino Määttä, deputy CEO of Sine product?
We are a film partner.
We are supporting this film, like many others in the company.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult films, Määttä says.
According to him, the products will be a special presentation, and the film will therefore be visible.
Is there something a bit funny about this-often when you think that the products and the stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, this is a unifying story, that we are a Finnish player and these are Finnish products, says Määttä.
According to him, the company advocates the same Finnish core values, which are supported by those who have witnessed the old unknown soldier.
And the cleaning is not for the army's cultural visitors, Määttä points out.
Unknown Soldier-The film's other corporate partners include, for example, Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, for example, Hartwall's Vichyt, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela, have been introduced to the market.
Unknown-products were already recorded by gut Finnish picture magazine blogs by Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the film's premiere, so the continuation is still in store.
Unknown partners have not yet revealed their military products, e.g. champion, processor, liquid and German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
The new results of the Swedish asylum-seekers ' age tests were announced
The latest results of the Swedish asylum seekers ' medical age tests have been published. The results of the tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of the tested were found to be over 18 years old. However, not everyone will consider testing to be reliable.
The Swedish National Forensic agency started testing earlier this year.
The tests can be used to assess the age of the asylum seeker more accurately. The new test was introduced after the criticism of the Swedish immigration Office that it had failed in determining the actual age of applicants claiming to be minors.
The Immigration office has commissioned so far 6 880 tests, and the forensic agency has now unveiled 2 481 test results. The tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July in 2017.
The 80, 2002% of the applicants tested were found to be over 18 years old. In addition, the forensic agency determined in 25 cases that the test was "possibly 18 years or older".
432 in the case in point, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under the age of 18".
The tests were conducted only in cases where there was reason to doubt the applicant's age.
Johan Göransson from the forensic Medicine agency reports that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly consistent. The big differences in The statistics of previous months are not noticeable, "he told The Local magazine.
Although a large proportion of applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that the applicants have been lied to in their age.
In May, the agency published a 581 test results and reported that the 442 case was "indications that the investigated is 18 years old or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet investigated the same results, it emerged that, in 243, the applicant was openly told to fill this year with 18 years.
The method of evaluating the medical age used in tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images from knee joints. Then dentists and radiologists analyse the images. The method has also been criticised.
One of the people is the Karoliinisen Institute's endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work involves evaluating human biological maturity. The assessment can be used to determine whether a person has become puberty earlier or later.
"I have had reason to think about this and I believe that the method used is not the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we are unable to determine the age, we should not pretend to be able to do so, "he said to the Metro newspaper.
The forensic agency Göransson, however, defended the accuracy of tests: "In general you can say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test will soon meet 18 years. Then the risk is about 10 percent. "
Ilonen collapsed in 30 places in Scotland

Governor of West Virginia to change party
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening the trumpet campaign in exchange for the party.
"The Democrats simply forsook me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflection... Today I tell West Virginia that I can no longer help you in the Democratic governor. "
The crowd broke into the rave applause.
"Tomorrow as a member of the registered Republican Party", Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's the time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that the campaign event in West Virginia would make a significant announcement.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points, as Justice was not supported by the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in the state.
He inherited from his father a mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
His wealth is worth about 1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee (RNC) published a statement that "the change of the governor's political party is another blow to a Democratic party, which would rather build barriers than better America."
"Democrats has only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership and is unable to find a positive message that unites people, "Ronna McDaniel, the RCNC, stated in his opinion on the CBS News .
Flashes sow damage-Thursday's coming up summer very thunderstorm
At the end of the week, there will also be more in southern Finland.
During the past week, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes were lit by several fires.
According to the Meteologist, Thursday may become a very thunderstorm in the summer.
The lightning storms have finally found Finland.
The past week has been lightning, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
The dust bolt struck a row in the House's electrical center, causing a small fire.
The rescue department received a notification from the fire about the quarter to midnight on Wednesday.
The electricity centre was located in the sauna area at the end of the row.
The rescue department landed a roof and a wall to find the fire spots and turned the fire off fast.
Altogether eleven homes were left without electricity, but the person from damage averted.
In Loimaa, the lightning lit the outer building to the Flames on the ridge before midnight.
At the time of the rescue facility, the building was already in full fire and the rescue service could not help but prevent the spread of fire.
The outer building, which is about fifty square metres in size, was burned to the ground.
In Kuopio, the lightning struck a detached house.
The inhabitants of the house were outside the building and witnessed a marked lightning strike.
The rescue service went on the spot to check the case, but this time the flash didn't get a fire-only a few fuse sessions.
In traffic, Thunder caused problems in the railway line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa, when the lightning attack was damaging to the traffic management system.
An information defect was received on Thursday morning between eight and nine, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was only remedied shortly before the five-afternoon.
Since then, the train traffic has also been able to continue normally in the course of thunder.
The Salamas have sown havoc in different parts of Finland.
However, the secrecy has been comparatively low this summer.
These thunderstorms of this summer have been quite overgrown! Evaluate the Meteorological Institute on duty meteorologist Jari Tuovinen.
The thunderstorms of Wednesday and Thursday have been mostly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low summer flash balance, it also feels even strong.
This might seem like a very hard one, but that's what it has been in comparison with this summer's swim, "says Tuokonen.
On Wednesday, the terrains were 1 700 times, and on Thursday there was potential even to the toughest day of the summer: around 16 p.m. in Plaka there was 1 790 terrain.
If the lightning still continues to the early evening side, then one can reach over two thousand lightning, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record year of the thunderstorm was experienced in 2015, when the flash volume of the year was around 30 000 pieces.
By Wednesday this year's flash volume was elevated to 18 386 to the secret.
So there is still a need for this year not to break the ' record ' of two years.
However, a thunderstorm can be expected to continue.
According to Tuominen, the air mass above Finland remains warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a fertile environment for the swim.
The main focus of the Thunder is to move to the south from the northern parts of the country, where approximately 2 000 lightning days can be obtained on Saturday and Sunday.
In the middle of the earth there is a more uniform rain front.
According to the importer, only a few thunderstorms are left.
Coe praises Russian ' open-minded ' apology for doping scandal
The world's athletics Upov, Sebastian Coe, praised the apology for his open-mindedness, which Russia presented on Thursday as a result of the doping scandal. The Coe, however, added that it was not yet time to stop the Russian ban on participation.
The Russian athletics director Dmitry Shjaht said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday at the eve of the World Cup that the Russian ban is appropriate and that he is determined to fight against doping.
He said he was sorry for all the athletes who were taken to a gold or silver medal in competitions.
Despite his comment, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of continuing the ban. Russia was excluded from the Athletics competitions in November 2015 after the report of the World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA, showed evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very straight. It was a very self-confessed performance, "the president of the IAAF, Mr Coe, told reporters.
"The whole Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Association admitted that the country had undergone difficult times and announced that it would do its utmost to reorganise its activities."
Coe also said he was "pleased" that Russia accepted the conditions for the closure of the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the task Force's recommendation that now is not the right time to stop the Russian ban," Coe said.
"We must do everything in the next few months to normalize the situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we want to keep pure athletes separate from the corrupt system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete for neutral athlete status at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday. They have met the stringent criteria of the IAAF.
On Monday, Mr Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF working Group, said that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
"Testing is still insufficient, and the operating-ban coaches continue to operate freely," he told reporters on Friday to the IAAF council after the presentation he had in London.
The production company was disappointed with the poor success of Tom of Finland
Tom of Finland's film did not become such a success as the authors hoped, says Yle.
If you are honestly told, I am disappointed, acknowledging the film's president and CEO, Annika Sucksdorff, in an interview with YLE.
I feared that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June it had reached over 100 000 spectators, which is the film's budget, to around EUR 5 million, compared to a little.
None of this lotto profits come, but now it's important that investors get their own back.
If the film had fared better in the home country, they would have already received their money.
Now you have to wait for the small streams of the foreign releases, the Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the economic rules of football affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The provisions restricting the use of money by European football clubs do not preclude the transfer of Neymar from Barcelona, Spain to Paris Saint-Germain in France. It is the most expensive transfer of football ever.
The possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are decided by UEFA, a European football regulator, who can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair-play economic rules. According to them, the PSG must be able to demonstrate that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.
For Barcelona, EUR 222 million was paid for concluding the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar's annual salary in the new company is circulating in tens of millions of dollars.
There are many economic aspects to the transfer of Neymar to France.
PSB has no difficulty in paying the Neymar transfer amount and attaching him to his star, as it follows the funding of the Qatari-enriched ruler.
Clubs are allowed to use large sums of money to purchase players, but they need to be balanced by real sources of income to ensure that the football-related business is not at a loss.
The economic rules for fair play were drawn up on the initiative of the French President, Michel Platinum, who was elected chairman of UEFA in 2007.
As a former soccer player, Platini believed that the pursuit of success by indebtedness was cheating and led to serious problems if the banks or owners pulled their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair-play economic rules shifted from club debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used by Roman Abramovich for the first time in Chelsea in 2003 was significantly hampered. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums of money on procurement and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period for fair-play economic rules will last until 2018. During this period, clubs may make a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
Although Platini had to leave the role of the president of Uefa in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Cefer, wanted to curb the use of money by the clubs.
"Fair play rules are still in place, and we will apply them in the future," said Andrea Traverso, a fair-play economic rules commissioner, told the Associated Press news agency last week.
Although the PSG paid the Neymar out of his contract with a lump sum, it can accrue the amount in the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual expense of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years.
On the basis of fair-play economic rules, the first sanctions were allocated in 2014. The major sanctions were imposed on PSX and Manchester City, the co-financed by Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million. In addition, the club was ordered to limit its group of Champions League team to 21 players for the 2014 – 2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial provisions by increasing its income through companies associated with the club owners.
For example, if a company in Qatar supports psg, but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal market level, UEFA will not calculate the aid as a real revenue.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the Qatari tourist authority's support for the PSX was over-sized.
It has also emerged that part of Mrs Neyts's earnings in the PSB could be financed by contributions from the organising committee for the 2022 football World Cup in Qatar.
However, the PSG and the organizing committee have denied that Neymars would be a World Cup ambassador. UEFA would be very easy to uncover such an arrangement.
Due to previous PSG sanctions, UEFA will follow the usual procedures in more detail to tour the rules.
The knowledgeable sources reported on Thursday that UEFA has not negotiated with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
The sources gave the interview to the Associated Press, on condition that their identity is not disclosed because they are not authorized to discuss the situation of the PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG's turnover for the period 2015 – 2016 was 542.4 million and operating profit above EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the past period have not yet been published.
The PSG awaits the arrival of Neymar with attractive new sponsors and an increase in the sale of club products and gaming shirts.
The club estimates that its net sales will increase by at least 30% as a result of the Neymar agreement.
The world's best player's departure from a distinctly irritated Spanish league attempted to complicate the Neymar movement. It was allegedly infringing the economic rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic case of doping both in the club and in the state," the Spanish league president, Javier Tebas, said to the Spanish as newspaper. The state he referred to the PSG's Qatar ownership.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state's funding of the football club's activities. Arsenal owns an American sports tycoon.
"The case is the result of ownership that has transformed the football environment completely over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the economic rules of fair play. There are so many kinds of interests related to the fact that the famous player represents the state. "
Now in a hurry: The Finnish athletes ' coach stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and the three-legged athlete Kristiina Mäkelä the coach of the Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, although he should be coached at the world Championships in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of his coach.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in the long jump qualifier and Mäkelä on Saturday in a triple jump qualifier.
The duo's coach, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa for the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this in a major UK broadcast without success.
The coach has the invitation to the World Cup organizers as a documentary, but it has not been issued to obtain a visa.
I wonder if this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or what the coaching director, Jorma Kemppainen, said.
He has always handled the visa issues himself successfully, but now there is some problem.
He will do his utmost to reach the scene.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports federation in Sulto for years.
It doesn't have such a big meaning.
As long as someone sees the step markers in the stadium, he was told by Arttu Pajulahti about the possible exclusion of his coach.
World Cup medal from Suomelontoosta requires a miracle
The world Championships in Athletics will start in London today on Friday and will last for a week ending on Sunday 13. August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the species to which Finnish bench athletes can be passionate about years of year, whether or not success.
In the hearts of sports athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course there are other indicators.
Less attention will be given to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from the value races, where experience gained is maturing to the athlete's performance to the level that the Adult World Cup medal is genuinely possible.
Now there are no young athletes in Finland's Small World championship, nor are there any other people.
The World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the attractiveness of sport and the element of surprise is that miracles can be the same.
It draws the bench athletes to the television screen and glue the races, even though the London medals are solved due to the time difference.
From their previous World championships in Athletics 2015 Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by the javelin thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
The daring is expecting a long-standing medal even though the other is telling the recent results of his and other throwers and the long-distance qualifier in the last summer's competitions.
No matter what happened in these races, Pitkämäki is in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes, entering a final competition or making a personal record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in Finnish athletics for the coming years, the realistic medal of the yacht will give a good success in the International Youth Championships this summer.
The processing of young talent and the financial support for its work is more important than maintaining a small elite of Representative surfers.
Success does not come in an instant, but requires years of sweaty effort from athletes and patience both for coaching and for sport athletes.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope that the London Games will be in the history of the competitions of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, and not, for example, in the fear of terrorism or cowardly attacks.

Viking Line's new quick ship got stuck in the harbour in Helsinki
Shipping company Viking's new quick ship fstr is lagging far behind schedule.
The quick ship had to leave Helsinki to Tallinn at 18 o'clock.
The ship had eight countries loading in progress.
The ship came to Helsinki already late.
At least one and a half hours I have waited for the ship.
Now the car queue is moving a bit, the Estonian boarding, which is waiting to be in the port of Helsinki, Johannes Rebane reported at 19.30.
Rebane thought that a new ship had become a technical defect.
Rebane reported that the shipping company had introduced water bottles for the boat.
The Director of communications at Viking, Christa Grönlund, says to the father that the side became a technical defect.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed for a couple of hours from Tallinn's return trip.
The ship had to leave Tallinn back in Helsinki at 20.15.

A small circle of nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and comrade Detective
At the same time, the story is the same as both the 80-century splendor of the characters and the 90-century grunge (in those days David Wain and Michael Showalter made a brilliant "The State" series for MTV) and his own times – years 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved to bigger stories in his career.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the continuing memory that we have stuck in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have been alive in its time.
The First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not only because of the absurd impersonations (it was the background story of the voice of H. Jon Benjamin as well).
At the heart of the joke is that middle-aged actors play the approaching lust teenagers. Its emphasis makes the past impossible to reach a part of the joke.
Ten Years in which adults play adults is less emotional, and the parody is more fragmented: for example, it parodies 90-century stalkers, such as a horror film that cradled the hand.
In one of the characters, we dig up an Apple PowerBook, inline roller skates and "Other stuff from 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as in the past.
The good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still hasn't gotten over Katiesta (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And there's a crazy storyline featuring Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) as a crime partner with George H. W. Bush (who is aptly portrayed by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best are the side paths.
Especially fun is to see Ikinuori Paul Rudd, who has a lower lip underneath the beard tassel, aka Matt Dilloni's "Soul Patch" from the movie singles. Ruddin's acting Andy, Camp Kingi, is starting to be an early old chump.
The moments of random madness may bring this series flying off as a kind of recursive Seven Up! -Series until it has a manifest decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years of the later. In its final scene, the group of Friends goes to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
The Amazon Comrade detective series again appeals to another nostalgia: The American Cold War spirit, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the Glow-series wrestling imagery where East meets the west.
The sitcom are created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and is directed by Rhits Thomas. It has been made into a Romanian police drama of the 1980 century, where a couple of the Bucharest cop fights for truth, atheism and markshism-Leninism.
Starring in the hard-headed Gregorina and idealistic Ioefiina is seen Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their dialogues have been dubaned in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-levist.
It's a great idea,
But there is more to it than that.
The series has some good visual jokes (cops spend time watching TV in chess in the same way that Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny. They get a fun game.
However, the comrade detective is too much to catch up with the clumsy socialist drama – for example, a killer hiding behind a Reagan mask. That's why the series often starts to really seem like a clumsy propagandalta.
The six long periods are too long, and the humor in the series is not fast enough or abundant.
In a nutshell, the series might work better with the agitprop satire, even when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy and in the lobby there are always two obese men to devour hamburgers.
The message for the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make all the commodities and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not mistaken: we were in the trap of our own lähihistoriaamme and their history.
Kouvolis Toni Tauru rises to the ring on Saturday in Macau, a former UFC athlete
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match afloat.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone in Macao because Brazilian Leandro was still in the UFC organization last year.
The Brazilian also has a jujutsun black belt and a world championship.
For once, I match myself with the older one.
It's a funny thing, the 32-year-old Tauru says.
The kouvolis had to ascend to the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three struggles were reached in the autonomous community of China in Macao.
The Tauru has not previously encountered such a.
This was the first time my match was canceled.
It irritated because the preparation and training took a lot of time.
The athlete, however, is pleased that a new date was reached for the battle.
Waiting for a week hardly affects the preparation.
The transfer does not affect your condition as it does not improve in a week.
The condition can be worse if you are now practicing too much.
In a few battles, the Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths are in the upright.
This time the situation is different.
ISSAA Kouvolis describes typical Brazilian.
He is a rather aggressive athlete.
I predict that he will come in the first installment top and try to take the carpet.
He has won the Jujutsu World Championship, so he knows how to wrestle.
The previous match of Kouvolis was not planned.
The Filipino Kevin Belingon slapped Taurua badly on the eye corner, and the victory was left to the Philippines.
I have never been so well, especially erect: he did not get any hits.
As I went down, he caught my eye.
It annoyed for a really long time.
New motivation
Some of the mixed martial arts are being made once a year, a fraction of which rises to the ring more densely.
For example, a future opponent was last time in September.
In turn, Taurus had three matches last year.
This is the second Battle of the year ahead.
In between, the stroke has become pregnant.
In recent years I have been training and been in good shape all the time.
I have, however, only been on the forehead.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the scenery for a while.
I was training in Espoo and I got the joy back.
We got some really good rehearsing when there was one guy from Sweden.
The training was a great help, as Kouvolis has to prepare himself for the physical struggle on Saturday.
I've got to work out against opponents of the same size and practice a vertical match.
Standing is the main tactic of the 32-year-old.
Keep hitting sensibly.
If there is a chance, I will certainly take the plot.
They must not be given free of charge as they consume the most.
Macao is attracted to Taurus in China before.
It is reportedly China's Las Vegas.
I think the front is big and nice evening.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep the interest rates unchanged, as economic growth has been relentless and the easing of inflation has stopped speculation on interest withdrawals.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to slow. The bank shifted interest rates because of the pressure exerted on the family income level.
The decision-makers of the Monetary Committee of the Central Bank decided by 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%. This month there was less support for interest rates, as economic growth has been feeble.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank decreased its 2017 growth forecasts to 1.7% and its 2018 forecasts to 1.6%. It also warned that the level of income from households is increasingly under pressure, as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate close to 3% in the autumn.
According to the bank, however, interest rates are needed in the next few years to curb the inflation of Brexit. In addition, the bank announced that the borrowing costs may have to increase in the financial markets more than expected.
In addition, the Committee members decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package that began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The bank is terminating the Term funding scheme in February 2018, although it is expected to provide affordable funding to banks amounting to GBP 15 million, i.e. a total of 115 million.
The memorandum of the bank's interest rate decision reads as follows: ' The Monetary committee forecasts that the slow development of gross domestic product will continue in the coming years, when the decline in real income of households will reduce consumption '.
As far as interest rates are concerned, the bank reiterated that there is a need for ' some degree of tightening of monetary policy ' for market expectations '.
The market is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that the possible increases were "gradual" and "limited".
In May, the bank predicted an increase of 1.9 percent for this year and an increase of 1.7 percent for next year.
It now held its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Against the dollar the pound weakened by 0.5 percent and was 1.31. Compared to the euro, it deteriorated by 0.4% and amounted to EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after the weaker than expected growth rates dampened the increased expectations of interest rate hikes. GDP increased 0.3 percent in the second quarter and 0.2 percent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation report gave little hope to the increasing inflation and to households affected by the shortage of salary increases. According to the bank, the situation is deteriorating even before it becomes better.
The bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" revenues from landing in the next few years. However, it expects that wage developments will recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also strengthen the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound sterling. It overrides some of the effect of the private consumption decline.
The decision was taken one year after the interest rate was lowered to 0.25% after the shock of the EU referendum result, which plunged the pound down.
The bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision will probably start to be reflected in prices and the economy only after four years.
Before the most recent decision of the central bank, interest rates had become increasingly vocal, as inflation tightened pressure on households. In July, the three decision-makers demanded an interest rate increase of 0.5%.
Last month, inflation was in 2.6% of 2.9% in June. According to the bank, however, it was expected and inflation will intensify in the coming months.
According to the bank, the overrun of the target level of 2% was due to a "totally" weak pound.
"In view of the recent decline in Swaps interest rates, competition in the mortgage market would appear to be increasing further when lenders are seeking feverically customers and want to end the year strongly," says Coreco Mortgage Brokers Director Andrew Montlake.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. The renewal agreements are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also no-cost options. "
The NHS imposes a controversial HIV drug in 10,000
From September onwards, patients may be prescribed a "epochal" anti-HIV drug. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute regarding the financing of the medicinal product in the English Public Health System (NHS).
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) treatment is prescribed for approximately 10 000 people during the first three-year trial. Prior to sexual intercourse the drug is found to reduce the risk of infection by about 86 percent in high risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court's judgment of last year. It says that the NHS will be able to pay for the PrEP, even if it claims that the local authorities should finance it.
On Thursday, Simon Stevens, president of the NHS, called "significant intervention", and the national AIDS organisation described it as "a crucial moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield begin to receive registrations for a trial that expands in October to other clinics. The experiment reaches its full range in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure Prevention (PrEP) is before sexual intercourse taken with an HIV drug that reduces the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection in risk groups.
Prior to sexual intercourse the medicine means that there are adequate medicines in the body during sexual intercourse that prevent HIV infection.
The medicine can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The target group of the treatment is gay men, bisexual men and transgender people with HIV-positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
The clinics are choosing to experiment with qualifying candidates for men, women and transgender as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive disease antiretroviral therapy.
People who are living in England and enrolled in general medical care can also seek an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs GBP 10 million, and the UK NHS signed a contract for medicines this week after the international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to evaluate the potential of the PrEP drug by collecting a broad clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and implementation of the treatment.
"This remarkable new intervention should complement and enhance the already existing diversified and increasingly effective ways to prevent HIV," says Stevens.
"It's yet another remarkable achievement in the fight for more than thirty years of the greatest health challenge for mankind."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Organisation.
"If the PrEP medication is correctly applied to the needy and those at risk, it can have a disruptive effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting from September onwards, the risk group will receive a medicine from the NHS-funded experiment, whose use can be determined independently without the need to negotiate with the partner. It has a empowering effect that will improve the lives of very many people.
This was welcome news. "
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and no one at risk is excluded," says Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP drug used in the experiment has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect people in the ten thousand risk groups from HIV infection."
The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event that was prolonged in vain for several months because of the government's slowness, "says Sharon Hodgson, shadow government minister for Health.
"We have evidence that the medicine can have a decisive influence on our work to prevent HIV and to stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment helps us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible throughout the country. This will enable us to protect the HIV-exposed and to move towards a step closer to the situation in which the spread of HIV in society has been successfully prevented. '
Quality of life: a mid layer and smart interior design have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
An enthusiastic former banker, Joanne Leigh, moved to the residential area of Knightsbridge, in 2014, the smaller apartment in Earl's Court.
The apartment is the Queen of Anna's period style house on the first floor. The success of the renovation is explained by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed its rig and moved.
"Before I lived with me in Knightsbridge, a much larger apartment," says Joanne.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price class.
I went here on the apartment screen and noticed that the rooms were as high as my then apartment.
I was fascinated immediately and I made an offer on the same day. "
Since then, approximately 90 square meters of housing have undergone a complete makeover.
It was a two-room apartment with a kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and a mid layer to make the room height more usable.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
They were my claim, "he says.
He hired the Duck & Shed design office at the Erfan Azad in Notting Hill. Erfan was commissioned to make use of nearly four metres of high room space and to create an apartment that would not only be a renovation and selling destination but a home.
The room height was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate layer where it could stand.
The solution called for a creative thinking from Erfan.
"The steel structures are quite complex.
The spaces had to be stacked in such a way that they do not require a kyyrist.
The structures had to be shaped so that the height is just right on both their site and underneath. "
Erfan was able to place two full-length rooms on top of each other with fascinating details.
On the mezzanine floor you will see a retrouvition with a copper-cross window in the stylish lounge area.
With mirror-golden furniture, silver accents and Serge Mouling, vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings the Teatraalisuutta, the feeling of space and light.
The mirrors on both sides of the short corridor will cause the corridor to be a real taller.
The mirror in the kitchen is like a window that opens up a view to another room.
The entrance to the mirror-like furniture has a storage space for Joannen's aterimas and glassware.
The elegance of the kitchen can be hidden when not in use.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution,
But the Joanne's kitchen is unique in that the door is lifted in the same way as the garage door.
"It called for a bit of design," says Erfan of the steel-reinforced high-density MDF door.
"It is balanced, which means it glides very easily in place."
With the use of sensible space and storage space, Joanne got 16 extra squares, a second bedroom and a better layout.
"When selling an apartment, the area counts – or valuation of the property," says Erfan.
"In the basic case, the Realtor walks in to the apartment and calculates the price based on the surface area."
In the Joannen apartment, the area was added using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The occupant is in contact with the materials of the dwelling, and a sense of the bond is created partly by virtue of them," says Erfan.
"No one is attached to the electrical wires that travel through the walls.
They are also important, but not in the same way. "
The Joannen housing is an example of the fact that good design and premium organisms can make the primary base exceptionally fine.
Then it can also be the case that the apartment no longer wants to be changed.
Pregnant Princess Sofia radiating her summer lookget
Princess Sofia's selection hit the pole.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad last time before her birth.

Sofia represented the event with a smile.
The Swedish Princess Sofia has visited the Båstad in Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented the A sustainable tomorrow seminar in a magnificent blue, fit-to-fit finish, which was beautifully shaped by a pregnant princess.
Sofia came to the event in a dark blue settlement.
This is the last representation event in which Sofia represents before the birth.
His calculated time is in September.
At the event dinner, Sofia had chosen a beautiful Pastellinsinisen dress, which landed wonderfully.
The style was crowned with large earrings and a stylish little bag.
Pastel Blue Puki nicely with the princess.
Sofia has been on a representation in Båstad in Sweden this week.
Sofia supplemented her with a small bag.
Sofia was almost radiant in its fresh summer lookers.
Sofia became enthusiastic about the event even chatting to photographers.

She grows us with sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, a booth appeared at Lahden Tori, where Thai food was sold.
Lahtelaiset did not dare to taste, but walked over.
In the Kojoussa, the food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among the familiar Panja.
He was not very Finnish, and the Finns did not even have Thai people at the time.
As the crowd dared not go to eat, the Panja offered free tasting.
In this way he taught lahtelaiset to eat Thai food, a spring roll at a time.
Countries, he said.
I stayed on the hook.
I attended more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened Thai food at the Lahti Market Hall.
It had two small tables, where there were less than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but to sit down next to a stranger.
When hunger and places are limited, you cannot leave the empty chair between yourself and your guest.
We were better acquainted and became friends.
In the end, I sat in front of the dish with the dictionary Learning Thai language.
Two years went to the trade Hall side, but then the restaurant had to be changed because the self-made spice pastes reportedly would be looking too much in the hall.
A new place was freed from the main market hall.
There is room.
Now we are jurotajat again to sit on our own tables, only during the congested times we have to ask the guest if there is room next to them.
The bank knows its customers.
He tells him what has happened and who has seen it.
He knows what food each eats.
He has seen how the customers ' life phases vary and the food club changes.
He remembers with a man I went to eat my first spring rolls.
She remembers me as a lashana and as a flesh, and remembers what I was a young age.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my place next to the kitchen door and exchange the news with a Panjan leaning on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we receive from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with sweet chili sauce.
He has opened the taste of our senses beyond our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many people talk to him about Thai-thanks to the popularity of tourism.
I admire the pledge.
Although he has been difficult, he is always friendly.
He is diligent.
In the restaurant, she is on a mushroom and a blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant celebrated its silence for two decades.
We got our guests dessert with strawberry cake.
Without any commotion or attention went this remarkable day, at work.
The discovery of an underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to strike in Europe
At the beginning of the year, the security authorities received an important list of the anti-terrorist work.
The list contains more than 170 of the Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German magazine Die Welt, there are a total of 173 persons, and the document also includes pictures of each person, in addition to their personal data.
Of the people listed, more than 130 are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikstan and Saudi Arabia.
The evening messages told me about the list and a couple of weeks backwards.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains has been clarified.
According to the magazine, the Iraqi army's special forces found a list of terrorists ' personal data and images when examining a terrorist organisation's underground base in Moulm.
The US intelligence authorities are evaluating the authenticity of the papers and forwarding them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
In the background there was the fear that something big and serious would be planned in the Western world by terrorists in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and images of all persons, but also their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the person's country of origin.
The list also lists the special terrorist areas.
For example, the German 27-year-old Sami J. is labeled as the battle name Abu Assid al-Almani, a German.
He is reported to have departed from Germany in 2012, first travelling to Egypt, then to Libya and later through Turkey, to join the ranks of the ISS.
His picture of the side is written as a specialist suicide bomber.
There is no more detailed information about the fate of the man.
In total, about 6 000 fighters have left the ISS in the ranks of the most, whose fate is uncertain.
A man sank under the surface of Helsinki at Tokoinranta

The person was found under water for about 15 minutes after notification.
Rescue diver found him under the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue service received notification of half of four after the afternoon.
The person was delivered to the primary care hands.
Estlander says it was about 50-year-old man.
On the basis of interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation at Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander commends the cooperation of the authorities with the border guards and the police.
It was a task led by the border guards.
The local divers also did a great job of diving.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Patrol and the police.
Two passenger cars crashed in Eurasia for nine people, three were seriously injured
There were nine people in the cars, the rest of which got less severe injuries, says the fire master on duty.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at a three-way junction at four times during the day.

The brothers fight over 500 million in real estate assets
Two brothers are arguing about the largest property empire in Victoria with a value of over 500 million dollars. The controversy relates to their Italian family of 40 years ago to establish their families.
Former Carlton Football club chairman and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Toraki area of values only three houses from his younger brother Paulista. The younger brother has taken to the Supreme Court the division of property and business property between the warring brothers.
Paul has been wanting to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter controversy about the difference.
The brothers and their mother Anna own together 38 properties with a value of more than half a billion dollars. The family began to accumulate property when they bought a shop on Collingwood's Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store, which expanded to 160 as a chain of business.
The retail chain was sold 85 million in 1999.
The money was used in real estate, and the family now owns offices, property development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento and apartments in the Gold coast and Mt Bullerin and suburban shopping centres.
According to an agreement with the deceased father, Colin owns about two thirds and Paul is about one third of the company's wealth. Paul portrays his father as the "family power and central character".
The right documents suggest that the division of property means that Colin owns real estate for about 316 million dollars worth and Paul about 176 million worth of money.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think that Colin has left the best real estate in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first affidavit in 2015.
The case was first discussed last Friday in the Supreme Court after several mediation attempts.
The brothers are now also arguing about who manages the existing business. Paul argues that Colin has ruled him out of business.
According to Colin, the argument is untrue. He blames Paul for some real estate mismanagement.
Colin writes in one of his first sworn testimonies that he would like to find a solution.
"According to our Italian traditions, the family is most important to me," Colin says in a statement.
The costs of the case are constantly increasing. Sworn statements, emails and reports are hundreds of pages. The case is being explored by consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter kick Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian settlers who founded milk bars and delicatessen shops in the late 1950. In the early 1970 century, they bought a shop in Brunswick's.
They were used as collateral for the family when buying a property in Collingwood, where Colin founded the first denim shop.
Colin says he has established a trade in "high school in the last few years when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis explains that she and in 2012 dead Luigi wanted to pass on real estate to her sons.
"Luigi often said that he didn't want the brothers to end up in court," Anna writes in a statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis group's business. According to Colin, Mark received 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are a "bitter departure from the economic conditions".
Colin has kept a low profile, although it is the former Australian Football League club board member and the television star Eddie McGuire's best friend, according to a biography published in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutic and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied. He told the text message that it was not right to comment on the matter, because it is being dealt with in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me in court and pull our families under the name of justice to battle," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to agree with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have liked us to be in this way," Colin continued and said he still hopes that a solution will be reached.
On Friday, hope seemed to have gone off.
"Our business will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
The new head of the trumpet staff intends to restrict the use of the presidential media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to Poltico, the new human resources manager in the White House plans to limit the use of President Trumpet's media and news monitoring so that the boss is not so often in trouble.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reports:
"When John F. Kelly, a new human resource manager at the White House, reassembly with the management staff on his first day at work, he raised the key problem he was going to tackle: he is going to restrict the information of President Donald trumpet.
Kelly told workers in the White House that all information – both printed and informative – must pass through him because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information. "
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit the use of the trumpet media and failed.
The President, Mr. Trumpet, has many decades of relationship with television – and as president he still takes a lot of television.
"If the President-designate Trump was nervous about the displeased news, he was in favour of showing that the sympathetic media dealt with the issues more equitably," said Sam Nunberg, advisor to the trumpet campaign. Politico Magazine in February.
Politica reporter Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "according to the six former campaign workers, it is essential to control the use of Twitter by his personal media stream".
Clear.
But it is ridiculous to argue that the use of the trumpet on Twitter had never been controlled.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something the rest of us don't know – perhaps the trumpet tweets would have been even more ferocious without their efforts.
We probably never know what kind of messages the trumpet did not send.
If his staff have been unable to prevent him, even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent the stir caused by the truter.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groupings in the White House trying to drive their case by giving the trumpet information that supports their vision. That information can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisors deliberately give the president questionable information.
The journalist Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
"The current and former employees of the trumpet say that he can be furious about the press clips where he is judged – especially if they tell of undesirable data leaks. Then he is absolutely compelled to know where the data came from.
This was the case at the end of February when someone gave the president a copy of the GotNews.com site of the web provocation created by Charles C. Johnson, who was accused by Assistant staff manager Katie Walshia from several White House Information leaks.
Johnson was permanently removed from Twitter because of harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and cancelled them later. Nor did he put forward any tangible evidence.
Despite that, Trump had begun reading the story from the staff at Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then personnel manager, Reince Priebus, and Rob Porter, the White House staff Secretary, had attempted to introduce a system of document management for the trumpet.
And what was the result?
Kelly is trying the same three months later.
Perhaps he proves to be a more efficient leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still pushing their own affairs.
These unchanged facts make Kelly's task extremely difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, says the news agency AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a 222 million off-the-line buy-in for FC Barcelona in the Spanish league football.
The Neymar agreement with Barcelona was therefore demolished, and he was free to move to the Paris Club PSG.
The huge transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in the history of football.
In the past, the record was at Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million from French Paul Poul.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatar company Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former tennis professional, Nasser Al-Khelaifi from Qatar.
Neymarin is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Success writer Raija Oranen has been back with alcoholism and flight fear: "I'm in good shape"
From the Tv series, the rose time and the clean white sheets of the renowned success writer Raija Oranen just celebrated his 69 birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Orasta.
Five grandchildren hold the mummia in their grip, as well as writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their houses, but now the spring also left for a rented apartment.
In light and the sun, out of the old circles, Raijan took the depression and alcoholism he had survived.
The external olemuskin is 20 pounds lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonin drugs were discontinued, they were anti-depressants.
To alcoholism, I was able to help with hypnotized, which is also the flight to fear, I won it.
I have been now without alcohol for 15 years.
Alcohol takes people, the flaming writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have traveled the same distance for over 45 years.
I can do better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen, who worked for Raija and the tourism industry, have been travelling together for over 40 years.
I was in Kos, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
Such a queen of drama he has always been, stopped his life from that, Jyrki laughs to his wife.
As a major writer of careers, Oranen remembers only a good 44-part clean white Linens TV series that touched and moved the recession time to Finland.
I finally decided on the clothing industry as a fresh family business, when I read Liisa Seppälä's 50 year interview on board.
I was the daughter of a dreschman, my motherly had a clothing business and I sometimes worked as a man in fashion, Oranen recalls.
The plot and story of the series transformed Finnish attitudes towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and doctoral thesis revealed, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer in active time, he has many scripts in the work-ideas for hundreds.
The nomads returned to the "Millionaires ' pit"
The home owners of the West Midlands are again at loggerheads Itsepintaisten with travellers who managed to cross the ditch and return to their adjacent field.
Travellers parked their 20 caravans near a street called millionaires ' flower in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat of the municipal passage. They brought with them children, horses and vans in the army.
The travellers were able to cross the barrier at a point that was left unprotected due to the path.
The infuried inhabitants have accused the municipality of Solihull of "total inability to solve the problem".
The anonymous tenant tells the traveller that the travellers had arrived on Monday evening from Bentley Heathrow, where they had been throwing passers-by with stones.
"The municipality has to be persuaded to act because it seems completely incapable of resolving the problem.
The nomads were here in May, then they left off but returned again.
They came in the evening more and probably even more today. "
The resident reported that the city of Birmingham had solved the problem by banning access to parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it is frustrating to pay for a municipal tax when the municipality is unable to do anything about it."
According to another anonymous inhabitant, it is ridiculous that the nomads returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them, and they have even fallen on the horse to graze the park."
According to the spokesman of the municipality of Solihull, the municipality is aware of the illegal camping in the vicinity of Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal steps with the police in Solihull to stop the campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for the gathering of evidence that as many local people as possible make a declaration of disruptive or criminal activity to the police.
It helps to establish a complete picture of the situation for legal proceedings. "
Infuried people besieged the Portuguese accident machine
In Portugal, the men who have been forced into a crowded beach have been questioned today in court.
Two people were killed yesterday as a result of the forced landing.
The two men who flew the aircraft can be prosecuted for their death.
Up in Portugal, 16 years of imprisonment can be obtained.
The men's flying small aircraft had to make a forced landing yesterday, due to a technical defect, to the beach in Sao Joao da Caparica, nearby Lisbon.
The beach was an event-time for hundreds of people, some of whom ran a descending plane to escape the water.
The plane was hit by a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit the man who was on the plane.
Immediately after the plane stood up and when it landed again, it hit the end of the child, telling the beach to have been to Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias magazine.
A little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not injured.
The shores of the beach were besieged by a small machine immediately after the turn of anger.
The girl's father and other people went to the machine and began to hack its origins, told the case in the Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It is a miracle that no more people died.
The two men who were on the plane were not injured in a forced bill.
The Finnish star, tragically lost his leg, won the gold medal: "Without unhappiness I would not be the world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated early on Wednesday morning Finnish time at the world championships in banked Slalem at the Canadian Big White competition.
In the past, Suur-Hamari also won cross World Cup gold.
There are already three titles in total.
Pretty AMAZING World Championship!
Two times the gold, the time with good heart rate is pulled, the greater Hamari was delighted by the telephone.
The 30-year-old skier praised his trainer and the successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamar, the number of challengers in the species is growing all the time.
The whole of Paraluminium has grown and developed very much lately.
The differences are reduced and there are many new riders involved.
It is always a wonder whether someone will guarantee a black horse.
Every race seems to be a different winner.
Suur-Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had gone out enthusiastically with his friends, and the accident didn't want to get to the slopes.
It is time for me to remind you that what kind of life would be without the accident.
But my attitude has always been that it is useless to be josible.
The cards are played, which are divided, the greater Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to have a serious accident and a loss of time as a good luck, and not a greater hamstring.
But he turned the karmic difficulty into his favor.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned into a triumph.
I would not be a triple world champion without unhappiness.
Before the crash, the biggest snowboarding zeal of the 23-year-old greater Hamar was already fading.
It was only after the accident that the Doven towards the peak started to start in earnest.
I practiced with friends at a young age, and we always get excited about X-games.
But they were distant dreams that faded somewhat over time.
After the accident I found myself in the X-games start.
I wouldn't have imagined beforehand.
I was 23 years old and I was wondering that this will be a very long life if I have been embitlated and grieved.
I decided to pull the overalls in the neck and start to work.
I would say that I managed pretty well.
The riders were delighted to be a wheelchair-worthy player from Leo-Pekka's selection as the sportsman of the Year.
The four-season Olympic champion won the award at the Sports Gala in January.
According to Suur-Hamar, the star's victory is an important signal for the sport.
It was a very big deal, and the victory was definitely deserved.
This will also open the eye to the world of sports.
When is the time to launch a double-world champion Matti Suur-Hamarin's athlete campaign of the year?
It will then be seen in due course.
I will try to do my best to succeed.
Even greater Hamari has not conquered all his lusts.
Next year is a big goal.
A year later, the Paralympics in South Korea are taking place.
Yes, we'll get a medal!
The majority of the Syrian refugee youth does not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and the Isis spring from the country
A Voice for young Syrian refugee study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrians living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees are baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian young people do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the war in Syria and the departure of the ISS are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their country of origin.
The trumpet administration does not see any change in the Syrian conflict.
The communications office chain, Burson-Marteller, explained the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marteller has already studied the opinions and attitudes of Arabinoten in the year nine.
This year, A Voice for young Syrian refugee study explored the opinions and attitudes of the young Syria refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian young people aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half Men were responsible for the study.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
42% of respondents may think they will return to their country of origin and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the decision to return to young people is the most affected by the war in Syria and the presence of the ISS in the country.
Nearly half (47%) Consider the end of the war to be the most active factor in permanent repatriation, while the fourth quarter believes that the most important thing would be to leave the country.
Only less than a tenth of the major decision-making factors in the recovery of the economic situation or Bashar al-Assad's departure from Syria.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict
The Syrian young people were asked what factor is most important for the closure of the conflict.
The majority is of the opinion that the end of the war is more essential than the abandonment of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair quarter keeps the president of al-Assad into a barrier to the peace agreement.
Almost half of it feels that both political and military solutions are needed to stop the ongoing Syrian conflict.
To resolve the conflict by means of military action alone does not think like a quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugee young people will see the weakening of the ISM in the last year, while the fifth is experiencing a stronger power.
Respondents argue that the most important thing in the fight against the father, and generally against terrorism, is that the media should inform people that the fathers have nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many people have prioritised military measures and the reform of education.
In the tenth position, the most important thing would be to create jobs that are better paid to young people.
When asked about the trumpet administration's impact on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe that the conflict is not changing during the trumpet administration.
Almost one in four believes that the Syrian conflict is in the worsening trumpet season.
Opinions are divided as to whether the participation of Russia and Iran has improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the Web organized-the database that he developed uses, for example, Wikipedia and Google
The Espoo company MARIADB develops the "fastest growing" open source database in the world.
Koodar entrepreneur Michael "Monty" the main product of MARIADB, which was founded by Widenito, does not cost users anything and can be developed via the Internet by any eminent programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of a Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
Databases allow huge data masses to stay organized and quickly accessible.
For example, if you are using LinkedIn, Twitter or booking.com, they will use MARIADB or MySQL database.
"Any information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, CTO of MARIADB, spends about half of his time coding.
A man who works in a beautiful way by remote work has a part to play in ensuring that the Internet functions smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database MySQL with the Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later the software left Oracle Ahmaisi Sun 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle transaction occurred, a large number of MySQL developers reported that they were leaving.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who didn't give a definite promise about MySQL's future," Widenius recalls.
He had already set up a company that started developing the mariadb at this stage.
He didn't want his life's work dying.
I hired a dozen of the best developers from sun, thus ensuring that the continuity of the code was secured with the same friends who would leave it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MARIADB was able to develop on its own haapasa.
The name just had to be changed.
The foundation was established to monitor the freedom of mariadb code development.
"During MySQL, these backups were not done," Widenius frets.
Although many people have heard about Widenid and one billion of MySQL's trade, few Finns know anything about mariadb.
"Over the last few years our growth rate has been around 50 percent a year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, CFO of MARIADB.
The growth-focused mariadb will not make a profit yet, and Paqvalén is a scarce company's key figures.
He reveals that in the current financial year, MARIADB expects to receive orders of EUR 20 million.
Because the database is free, the company has developed a service around it, of which business customers are willing to pay.
MARIADB also helps in exchanging databases, which may be more than a year's contract if the customer has used a closed database.
MySQL's exchange to mariadb is a snap, because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank of South-East Asia, the DBS, are the paying customers of MARIADB.
The most popular cloud services, including Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer their customers a mariadb.
At the same time, MARIADB will automatically spread to new users in Linux operating system distribution packages, where MARIADB has largely replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small company, we have links with the biggest pelusos.
"Among our customers there are some of the world's largest telecom operators, game companies, banks and even a few central banks", Paqvalé's list.
The database market is still prevailing in the closed databases of giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP.
For Oracle, MySQL is a modest page about the business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although according to the research company Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, as measured in terms of turnover, those who are like mariadb are still void, albeit rapidly growing seals.
With about 50 billion dollars in the database market, open source databases do not even sustain billion.
However, the importance of open source cannot be measured in monetary terms, since the majority of users do not pay anything for these software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies are already developing more than 70% of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would then have been exchanged for open or the transition would be at least initiated.
The big companies will not get new customers, as most of the next one chooses open source.
This has meant that licence fees for commercial databases have jumped into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as they used to be, "Widenius wonders.
Because it is a hassle to change a closed database, most of the client companies have been dutifully swallowed up by the price hikes.
"There are a lot of customers for whom the transition is really difficult because their old applications and others are closed in a closed database," Widenius says.
He still believes that the customers ' measurement is becoming full.
When license fees go up every year, the customer will sooner or later enter the open source database.
The price is 10-20 percent earlier, and the service better because the customer can easily choose to switch to another database.
In addition, many companies also face major system changes when they relocate their operations to cloud computing.
At the same time, many Exchange database software.
Last spring, MARIADB received EUR 25 million from the EIB.
It was the largest financial expansion ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now going to recruit more.
One of the reasons for EIB financing was the influence of mariadb on public it procurement.
The company has public sector customers in the UK and Germany, for example.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros each year in databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax money more effectively," says Paqvalén.
Widenista is annoying how to waste money in Finland, for example, in closed healthcare systems when open systems are cheaper and the Subscriber is not at the mercy of a single software company.
Some say that open source code is an ideology, but in my opinion it is a better way to make code.
The community is helping and doing something that is not invented or able to do.
55-year-old Widenius is one of the best-known open source developers, along with another Finnish Linux developer Linus Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on the open source.
I still like 4-5 speeches every year around the world about this topic.
Italy to strengthen its approach to civil society rescue vessels
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations that are rescuing refugees in the Mediterranean, that they are not allowed to continue their activities unless they undertake to comply with the new rules on their activities.
"If non-governmental organisations do not commit themselves to a new policy, it is difficult to see how they can continue to function," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with La Stampa, a Torino newspaper.
The Minniti warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized the ship of the German Jugend Rettet. Its crew is suspected of having made cooperation with human smugglers, which contributed to illegal immigration.
For only a year, the aid agency refused to comment on the detailed prosecutions of the prosecutor Ambrogio Cartoo.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area, "said the organisation in a social media opinion.
"We can only judge accusations when we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been observing the Iuventa platform of the Art Nouveau retet organization since October.
The crew was suspected of having taken on board the ship in a gradual manner from the direct influx of refugees from human smugglers who had their boats reused.
One such case is alleged to have occurred only a few kilometres from the Libyan coast. This information is reflected in the Prosecutor's document, which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian coastguard, which oversees the rescue operations in the region. The motive is to be the enthusiasm of helping.
According to the Code of conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who supervises the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to follow the procedure: Save the Children and the Maltese Moas and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
Who announced on Thursday that they considered the new rules to be superfluous but acceptable, because they did not pose "significant changes or obstacles" to the organisation's rescue operations.
Among those who refused to comply with the code of Conduct is the Nobel prize-winning Médecins Sans Frontières.
In turn, Minniti stated that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, as evidenced by the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and the cooperation between local The mayors are beginning to produce results.
"The last few days have started to show light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that it is planned to continue this month's discussions with the Libyan mayors on the economic development projects, as well as with Chad, Niger and Mali, on measures to reduce Europe's outgoing refugees Number of.
A seasonal worker is suspected to have been slain by his unmarried partner in Enontekiö, the suspect was found in the terrain-the lawsuit prosecutor
The alleged crime occurred in the Enontekiö last December.
According to the police, the Czech 36-year-old man is suspected of killing a 26-year-old Scottish unmarried wife.
In the past, we have been told that both were seasonal workers.
The police also told me that the suspect would have fled with two dogs in the terrain after their deeds.
The man was found bathed in terrain, and he did not resist the resistance.
The prosecution must be lifted within a week.
The case may still be in the District Court of Lapland in August.

Michelle Carter sentenced to imprisonment for suicide-inciting text messages
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for texting and calling, which she was considered to have stirred her boyfriend Conrad Roy to suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, performs 15 months of his verdict in jail and five years in parole.
Carter was sentenced to kill in June. Her boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide 13.7.2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said in Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter appealed against the judgment and had to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers both Carter and Roy suffer from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and creamy pouch, listened to her sentence with a weeping gaze.
"His deeds were killed by Conrad Royn," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He decided to have Conrad's life in order to improve theirs.
He has not taken responsibility for the Act, "the prosecutor continued.
"He has not shown remorse."
According to Carter's lawyer, the incident was the result of "the tragic circumstances which he deeply reflects."
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, felt that Carter's "age or maturity level and even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions".
The prosecutor read the statement by Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, who said that "no day, I would not mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can cope with all this. I try my best to comfort his sisters in this pain, which we will always bear. "
Conrad's sister Camdyn Roy told the court that he was "haunted" by the idea that he would never see his brother's wedding and not be an aunt to his children.
"It is painful to lose a person who has been in my life every day since my birth. It's agony never does, "Camdyn said.
The case seems to be a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in the car for a carbon monoxide poisoning dead in 2014.
The incident aroused national attention when it emerged that Carter had in his text messages incised the son his friend to commit suicide.
"Hang yourself, jump from the roof, stab yourself. I don't know the ways there are many, "Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent to Roy during the two weeks prior to his death. Roy was then on holiday with his family.
Just a little before the Royn suicide Carter wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "you just have to launch the generator, and you're free and happy".
Judge Moniz said that Carter applied for the attention of Roy's death. The judge ordered that Carter should not benefit from the incident by issuing interviews.
The case has divided the experts ' opinions.
Few have defended Carter. One of the defadvocates is Amanda Knox, 30, who was sentenced to British roommates for murder in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published a Knox opinion, in which he states, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary-General: Relations with Russia the worst then the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated markedly, commented on the NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg stated in an interview with Cnn's.
After the end of the cold War, we hoped that we could try to close cooperation with Russia.
But since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the constant instability caused by Russia in eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, Nato is still committed to working in such a way that tensions are not tightened.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid the escalation of the situation and the new Cold War.
Before the comments of Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump of the United States managed to find that the US and Russia had drifted to a dangerously poor level.
Trump urged to thank the countries for the bad terms of Congress, which last week approved the new sanctions against Russia.
Audi makes changes to a 850 000 diesel engine due to a setback experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Audi's announcement BMW offered to upgrade to over 350 000 car software.
The director of BMW said the company believed that "there are more sensible options than driving restrictions". He referred to European cities, including the home town of BMW in Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it would make changes to more than 3 million Mercedes-engined engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke of a callback.
European car manufacturers have invested heavily in the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve the targets for CO2 emissions.
Diesel engines with nitrogen oxide emissions are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs for neutralizing equipment are rising, making it difficult to price the cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being monitored strictly, and chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of helping large car companies and ignoring the problems.
Companies try to avoid Volkswagen mistakes. Volkswagen installed in cars scam equipment that reduced emissions to conform to the regulatory tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
A number of Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States, but the leaders ' efforts are being explored on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the director of the Audi Engine Development department's former thermodynamics manager was arrested in Germany.
Zacheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was pulled under the Volkswagen criminal investigation. The authorities doubted that Audi had installed a system capable of circumventing European emission requirements. The accusation was based on similar research in the United States.
Audi's investigation can significantly undermine the Volkswagen position: the luxury car manufacturer's share of Volkswagen profits is disproportionately high.
The vote in Venezuela began with a cheating investigation, big demonstrations in the
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion on the company, which has no role in the election result, the Chairman of the National Electoral Committee, Mr Tibisay Lucenan, said to reporters.
Maduro declares the end of the crisis
In Venezuela, in a controversial vote on Sunday, a representative council was chosen to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and has arranged for it to be changed against demonstrations.
The opposition who opposes Madoro has postponed its own demonstrations in such a way that they would be running at the time of appointment.
According to the newspaper El Pais, the national security forces in the country began a local time on Wednesday evening to take over the country's parliament building.
The troops are supposed to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change threatens the Provence lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region in southern France, but it is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender was reduced due to drought and disease-bearing insects. Scientists and farmers are trying to find a solution to the problem frantically.
"Lavender is downright endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered in recent years from the effects of climate change. With them, the rainfall in the spring, and especially in autumn, has declined markedly, "says Eric Chaisse, a specialist in the Research Institute of Crieppam in Provence.
"This shortens the life time of lavender.
In addition, drought has brought the region a lot of small kaskaita, which are propagated by Microbacteria. "
The stakes are hard.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly sought after perfume and cosmetic ingredient.
"Instead of long cones and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or completely absent," Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer components that contain essential oil."
The solution is sought by increasing irrigation, slowing down the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying plants with a mixture of clay and water. In addition, more drought-resistant varieties are being developed.
Journalist murder reveals growing threat in Mexico
The delivery of the Riodoce newspaper once a week usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the journal deals with the most recent cases relating to organised crime, corrupt authorities and War in Sinaloa state.
Today, however, we are debating security as a result of a recent tragedy.
Journalists have been invited to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: leave the children at home or involve them in the delivery of a grenade attack in 2009.
Safety experts have written three words on the blackboard on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask suppliers for names in each group. No evidence is required, observations and sensations are sufficient.
Names of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected to be on the payroll of government or drug cartels are written on the blackboard. They are criminals who make Mexico's chaos of news reporting life threatening.
Violence is uninterrupted, and more and more of the attacks are being targeted by journalists. According to the Journalists ' Protection committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered after President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. Under the aegis of the federal government, 589 of the victims of attacks and threats. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states during the current year.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, journalist and inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez co-wrote about many of his books on drug abuse.
He is sorely needed, even if he is present everywhere. The façade of the Riodoce building is covered by a huge picture where Valdez looks like a middle finger. The picture says: "Justice". The thirty journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts adorned with the smiling face of Valez. Valdezilla has glasses and is a trademark of Panama.
The meeting will take place less than two months after the death of Valdez. Journalists discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoid fears over their own homes.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was established to deal specifically with journalists ' cases, but, according to the Journalists ' Protection committee, only two indictments have been brought so far.
Only rarely are the murderers of the journalists involved in justice, as well as the thousands of murders of drug trafficking and organised crime that only a few people end up in court.
The RIODOCE editors intend to continue writing about the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are heartbroken and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security summit is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is frankly a waste of time," he says.
"We can't count on anyone as long as we don't know the reason for the event."
Valdez had left for Riodoce's delivery in the provincial capital of Culiacan in the morning of 15.5.2017.
He had been driving a red toyotalla, just a couple of blocks away, when two men stopped him and forced out of his car and shot twelve shots. The number is supposedly related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce stands for the twelve rivers.
The shooter drove out of Valezz by car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left to mourn the wife and two grown children.
Rumors are moving quickly and the Vellare free to Culiacan.
However, the death of Valtz is silent.
Sinaloa has been the most bloody battleground in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January. Competing factions want to fill the void.
In the streets of Sinaloa we shoot someone or several people death every day, and the cemetery has a drug barons with decorative two-storey burial buildings that are larger than those of many home houses.
The state on the coast is "peaceful" when only one cartel manages ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and leader of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty about not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two errors led to the murder of Valtz.
In February, he published an interview with Damaso Lopez. He leads a competing bloc who is waging war against the sons of Guzman.
The story could upset Guzman's sons: Customers who suspected gang members bought each number of the magazine as soon as the magazine entered the sales outlets.
The second error was that Valizia was not forced to leave the country after another press of the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many things that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear on his behalf.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to establish a five-time colleague, Riodocen. The shares of the magazine were sold for 50 dollars.
In the Sinaloa "it was impossible to make journalism without dealing with the drug problem," says Bojorquez.
Over time, the magazine became familiar with its courageous and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenues grew.
The editors appreciated the possibility of publishing a hard-class investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by the journal stuff that nobody else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for his news in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Press freedom Prize from the Journalists ' Protection committee for his courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade relentlessly.
He openly admitted to fear.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said by receiving the Journalists ' Protection Committee award.
Drug trafficking is a blue-light "lifestyle," Valdez said in a Ropeviento TV interview last October.
"The journalist must accept the task to be borne by him – or play stupid.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when I was bathed in death – why didn't I tell what was going on? "
The RIODOCE staff longs for the "Valdezia", a curse that was cursed as a port worker. They crave a friend who always got a hug and advice. They yearn for a teacher who knew how to cope.
They trusted in his routines.
He always used Panamahtua.
He attended the bar El Guayabo and was always seated at the same table.
Now they ask whether the routines were to his fate.
A colleague's death has also led them to consider how they can best do their job and stay alive.
"Criminals do not like it if we deal with their naisas and their children and their clean business, their secret drug-trafficking runways.
They were excluded from the talk, "says Bojorquez.
In the best case, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection,
Trusting your instincts.
If you feel that everything is right, keep staying away.
The problem is, according to the Riodoce journalist, Andres Villarreal, that "the impression can be deceiving, and that is what happened in Javier's case".
The old rules no longer apply in the blue, nor do they apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruzissa, Guerrero and other federal states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt Authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
The mobile phones could not be brought to the room where the Riodoce safety training was held. A few days earlier, it had emerged that only governments selling spyware had been tracked by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought to shade the tree with a 40 degree of shelter.
The provincial government had ordered them to guard the Riodoce premises located in a Nelikerroksisessa building in the middle class Culiacan area.
Some of the journalists were half-jokingly, whether it was these two policemen that were in the ranks of 50%, which the governor of the State did not consider reliable.
It was already months since journalists were in the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
This week's number, Riodoce's delivery was outlined in three main stuff.
Boxing magnitude the brother of Julio Cesar Chavez was killed in a Sinaloa.
The magazine also intended to disclose that the government's use of money was focused on the governor's hometown.
In addition to the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just one block away from the prosecutor's office, was kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed cautiously: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug traffickers and public authorities.
The journalist found out in public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). PRI has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in widely publicised cases.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about past cases in the same place. In one of them "El Chapo" the son of Guzman managed to escape and avoid the army raided.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they would receive reliable information about the abduction from the Valez column.
"In the past, we'd already known what had happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, who has got a hokan in his physique due to the nickname "El Flaco", a crepe.
"Now all the connections to our data sources are cut off."
The office of Valtz has been transformed into a warehouse, which maintains the anti-persecution signs and labels. The employees of the magazine have had a new, unexpected task: they have become activists who are driving the freedom of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs on leaving the next morning to the local prosecutor's office for a demonstration that was again the cause of the new murder of the journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the west of Michoacan three days after the assassination of Valez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found which, based on DNA testing by the authorities, is adame.
Journalists have started to protest louder across the country. In the demonstrations, the "SOS Press" texts appear on the sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Mr Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to get international support for the Valtz case investigation.
On the day after the murder of Valrez, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they tell the truth.
He has since asked that he be moved away from the government, because he is worried that he will not be able to be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico journalists are surrounded by organised crime, crime-permitting authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narkojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed by politicians and security forces, in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Articulo 19 control group, more than half of the attacks against journalists last year were the police and the authorities.
"In Mexico people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murhilla has a crippling effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the north of Tamaulipas in the state six years ago.
His body was a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I am in this writing."
His loose-cut head next to it was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to cease their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the north Chihuahuan the border of the country, following the assassination of Miroslava breach after the March murder.
Some continue to operate, such as the Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although its director was murdered in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to drug cartels on his front page: "What do you want of us?"
Some of the suppliers have fled from their state or country.
It is a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and the whole time must be on guard.
Sometimes criminals seek a journalist's hands, as apparently visited by photographer Ruben Espinalle, who was murdered with four women in a dwelling in Mexico city in 2015, three months after he had fled Veracruzista.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra – who was to become a poet at the time – admits that writing about the drug trade is scared.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on his way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, the Riodocen reporters sat on Friday at midnight on delivery in front of the sidewalk with beer, when the magazine's latest issue was completed. Suddenly their phone began to colour a message.
19 people were killed in a shooting action between rival gangs and security forces at the Mazatlani Beach Resort.
The war accelerated, as was promised in the messages of the cartel found in the region.
Journalists put the news on Riodoce's websites on the sidewalk with their smartphones.
The home had to be put new the next day.
Sirens are howling nearby – yet another shooting scene.
Bojorquez glanced at the delivery of the guarding police officers:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's delivery continued in the magazine's murdered founder's tradition under this massive portrait, where the man appears to have a middle finger on the entire sinlower.
Bojorquez says that you cannot even consider stopping the operation. "How could I close the magazine when our trainee asked to get to the street to do something even on the day when Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge setback-"the Hard Place"
In April 39, the celebrations of Hannu Manninen were short, as the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training season began to be catastrophic when Manninen became ill flu.
It began with a long period of sickness, which stretched almost five weeks.
May, in practice, went completely ill.
First, there was a flu and finally a baby disease like an ear infection to which I had to eat a antibiotics regimen.
I was able to make only 10% of the planned exercises.
I don't remember when I last had some long hurts.
It was a tough place when I didn't get the training enthusiasm, Manninen is telling the evening messages.
Test result collapsed
During the second week of June, the 2007 world champion was only given a training permit, which was reflected in the 12th On June 1, 2004, a racing and top sport Research centre in Kihu's roller mat test.
In the test, the athlete ski on a roller on a carpet with a speed of increased every three minutes.
After each three minutes, the mat stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes the athlete's finger from the needle to the lactic acid sample.
Last fall I was on the mat for 32 minutes, but now I remained only 28 minutes.
Came against the wall, Manninen says.
Better
After the initial difficulties, Manninen says he has remained healthy.
I have done a wide range of calm aerobic exercises in which I have tried to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now the back is a really good five-week episode.
The midsummer was also a week and a half after the flight.
I could also visit a cottage with my family.
In the last season, Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the home in Lahti World Championships.
The best result was seen immediately in the opening race when Manninen climbed to 18th.
Guidelines pulled
Manninen and the national team coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan until the next February.
We now search for a different rhythmic workout compared to the last season.
After the first snow games, Ruka would have a weekend of three World Cup races.
In December, the intention would be to be involved at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsaoussa.
At the end of January there would be plans to be included in Seefeld.
Hopefully, after the name is found on the Olympic team's list, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchangi Olympics would be for Maniselle already a career in the sixth Winter Olympics.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City 2002 gold in the team competition celebrating Numminen's underline.
Dinosaur sheltered from enemies by disguising
At first it looks like a scary statue.
Now scientists have revealed the first research results of a Canadian miner finding a rhinoceros, which was so well preserved that the experts call it the dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that the researchers were even able to determine that its scaly skin was reddish brown and had a "problematic past".
According to Current biology, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur of all time and the world's best representatives of its kind.
The newly found fossil is Nodosaurus, which is the middle of the Cretaceous between 110 and 112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a really significant discovery.
According to National Geographic magazine, an armoured vegetarian is the most preserved fossil of its kind ever.
It was found at the Suncor Millenium Mine in North Alberta, Canada 21.3.2011, and was discovered by Shawn Funk.
He was hit by something that did not seem to be a natural part of the cliff surrounding it and decided to investigate his findings more accurately.
The fossils found in the cliff were sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrelli.
There, the beast was dug up for six years with a 1 100 kilo of lohkaresta.
The results of hard work are now visible.
"If you cross the eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping," says Tiedekirjoittaja Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrelli.
"It leaves the history of the story as the Dinosaurs ' Mona Lisa, one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs.
The leather studies revealed that dinosaurs for meat-eating were likely to pose a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it was an armor and it resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor masks it from predators, and it also protected the darker and lighter colouring, which still occurs in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to blend in with its surroundings and dodge its enemies, bigger dinosaurs.
110 million years old Nodosaurus rose to the headlines in May and is now exhibited in Tyrrell's Royal Paleontological Museum.
The researchers have named the name Borealopus by Markmitchell Museum technician Mark Mitchell. Mitchell belonged to a team that took over 7 000 hours to dig the dinosaur up.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and the international investigators team have been able to determine its body scales and armor patterns and shape.
They found that it still protected the animal world in general, where the body is darker and lighter underneath.
The observation was still surprising, because the borealopto is much larger than the current animals with similar colouring.
It can be inferred that the dinosaurs that eat the flesh did not, to the extent that evolutionary favored survival as a means of hiding instead of a battle.
Current animals, for example, deer, Seepro and armadilla have similar colouring. They are considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that the nodosauruskin was under serious threat.
"The predation of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous were," Brown says.
The chemical analysis of Nodosauruksen salts of organic compounds reveals that its leather was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study nodosauruksen in order to draw conclusions about its life. They investigate, among other things, the contents of the gut to find out what they ate at their last meal.
Scientists believe that it fell upon death into the river and drifted to the sea, where it sank to the bottom of the sea.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is today in Florida, and rivers and seas were likely to reach much further than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is really remarkable because its scaly leather has survived and is also preserved in three dimensions in its original form," Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost like the early Cretaceous
Perceiving it does not require much imagination: if you have a little eye, you can almost believe that it was sleeping. "
The Cretaceous age was the era of the the huge two-legged, carnivorous dinosaurs.
Even though their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, or millions of years of BOREALOPELTAA in the past, its mighty predecessors may have prey on this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of the Tyrannosaurus rex, for example, included Acrocanthosaurus, a sixteen-metre-long-11.5 m tall monster.
The latest findings of Nodosauruksen researchers have been published in Current Biology. They believe that Borealis was washed into the sea after death and mummification.
It was found at the Suncor Millenium Mine in North Alberta, Canada 21.3.2011, and was discovered by Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armoured dinosaur with its skins and armor from the flower to the hips.
The Nodosaurukset were averaging five feet long and weighing up to 1 300 pounds.
Their pallets were raised by two half-metre peaks.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian went through the current west of Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor is preserved in small detail in the undersea tomb.
Its fossil-contaminated remnants have survived so well that its leather is still left in the armor-bumpy plates along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic journal that such survival is "just as rare as a lottery win.
The more you consider it, ällistyttävämmältä it feels.
Its skull armor's bumpy plates still have a fossil-loving leather.
Its right forefoot is on its side, five of the toes upwards.
I can also count the scales of the bottom of the foot. "
How can one activist learn to answer the question: To whom are the streets covered?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked by the 9.8.2014.
He had arrived a day earlier in New York from his home in St. Louis and sat on the bed of Airbnb browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"The police killed just 18-year-old young, and his body is still on the street."
In amazement, he noted that no one else had post the same information in his feed. That's why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
On his timeline there were numerous retweets from the user @TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to a rapper in St. Louis, who tweet in real time about Michael Brown's death. The white police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black-and-brown Fergusonissa in the state of Missouri.
This user also had a post in the image of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is unbelievable," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for him and his community.
He put his phone away. When he returned to Twitter later that evening, it was reported that people flocked to Canfield Drive.
The users post pictures of the police's sluice-and-cry people and the man who claimed to be the father of Brown, whose position in the billboard read: "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed real-time video, where the police stood in front of the proteers with a barking dog.
He says he also saw a video where another policeman was screaming and cried, "I kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers.
"It was not the kind of murder we have been accustomed to and could be said to be typical.
Then I felt cold ripples.
I was angry and cried. "
He drafted a return flight for the next day.
The plane landed in the eleventh evening. Ferrell went to get his six year old daughter from his father and decided they would go Fergusoniin the next morning.
Of what was going on for Ferrele and Fergusonille over the next nearly three years, a documentary film, "Whose Streets?", has been made. It premiered in cinemas in 11.8.2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, of love and loss, and of strength and perseverance from the point of view of local people who took to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Fergusonia in a floral dress and with his daughter, dressed up with it, they resumed a conversation about "what it is to live in black and under what conditions." They had spoken countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you how blacks have had to fight for the things that they believe?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Fergusoniin because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and it's not right."
"I couldn't ignore my daughters," Ferrell told me later.
"Today's events are... the culmination of past events.
My daughter has the right to know it and grow it.
He must have the capacity to engage in activism and organization, but he must also be familiar with the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living in black and white. And he must know what we have to do to liberate ourselves.
Although I have fortunately been able to protect him from blatant racism, he is still similar to other black girls.
It seems to me that I would damage him if I protected him from reality. "
Their first stop in Fergusonissa was South Florissant Road, located opposite the police station. It became a camp site for activists when they waited for information on the case and finally learned that there was no prosecution for the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entreprenus who made lunch packages.
They were to freeze their lunches in bags and distribute them to the demonstrators.
Ferrell gradually began to take activism in a new way.
"Activism was completely changed on August 9th. After the day, "he says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of the Association of Nursing students belonging to minorities. At that time, he focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience of organisation.
Somehow it just happened. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met the assistant director of the documentary Sabah Folayan during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and the cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "simply wanted to tell" what was happening.
Ferrell reminded me of a suspicion. He asked, "Do you really want to tell what is happening, or do you want a story that you can take advantage of?"
The background to the suspicion was the countless times when people were appearing in the local community, usually white, who only wished to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that Fergusonissa born and bred did not have a common voice," Folayan told me in a recent interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, known for his activism on death-sentenced prisoners.
The involvement of Davis prompted Ferrell to embark on the project together with six other local authorities. The filming group followed the events in the years following the shooting of Brown.
"This is not a documentary where someone is speaking to us or speaking on our behalf, but we're talking," Davis says.
"The most important thing for me is how the local people are presented in the film, because I am presented in the same way."
According to Folayan, it was not the intention to focus on the experience of Mrs Ferreira, because it was intended to show that the people ' s movement is ' not a charismatic leader, but a community '. However, Ferrell proved to be the most transparent.
This is why the documentary shows surprisingly private facets of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and Naimisiinmeno.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when telling how it seemed to see the movie for the first time.
"But I understand that this work and the human imaging of black requires a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's Story times and re-brings the Black lives of the queer women into the middle.
The movement was born in the social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot the black teenage boy, Trayvon Martin, in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with the queer identity.
"The leadership of the Black queer women has kept the whole movement alive," says Ferrell. "It is because we are constantly fighting on many fronts.
The Black queer women have been forced to endure everything. "
Folayan is in agreement: "The movement really is maintained by black women, among whom there are many queer women."
However, he emphasises that Ferrellä was not selected for the document "self-intentionally" because of its queer identity.
"He's got the energy moving," Folayan says.
"It is not a coincidence that he was on the front line. The Black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot in the game.
His energy is conveyed on the big screen. "
The news groups have left Ferguson long ago, but the gaps between the community and the police are still strained.
There are still two and a half years of parole for the ferret. He received a judgment on the blockage of a motorway in a demonstration.
His description of the social-political atmosphere of his hometown is short and concise: "Mess."
Yet he still trusts the slogan he learned from the exterior of the Ferguson streets three years ago:
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains. "
An appropriate resemblance: The artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
In New York City, the Fridman Gallery is hung in the middle of the exhibition room face – white, black and brown faces, where you can see resemblance in more detail.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples from Chelsea Manning's cheeks and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Levenworth prison where he received 35 years of judgment. Manning was sentenced to a secret-classed leak of diplomatic telegrams to the Wileeaks website.
The exhibition at Dewey-Hagborg A becoming reemblance was opened in 2.8.2017.
It is driven by two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence, Barack Obama, eased his term of office on the third last day.
Dewey-Hagborg analysed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, albeit somewhat theoretical, statement of the editability of DNA data, ambiguity and the underlying cause-and-effect relationships and identity.
Chelsea Manning, a birth named Bradley Edward, has openly said that he has been identified with women since the age of puberty. In 2013, he was found guilty of 20 offences, including the violation of the law on espionage, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of the imprisoned Manning, the grainy, black and white selfie, where the haunted Manning was sitting in the car at the driver's seat. He has a platinum-blond wig, which became his hallmark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was the strong-acclaimed Stranger Visions Project, which he conducted in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data. He received DNA data from tobacco-like cigarettes and chewing gum, and created pictures of what the people in question could have been.
The artist then received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manningia and needed a picture of her," Dewey-Hagborg told the new exhibition at the news conference.
It was not possible to visit Manning and he could not be portrayed in prison. Thus, the magazine contacted Chelsea and asked if he would be interested in making a DNA portrait of Mangel.
The artist and his imprisoned mummy suddenly became a change of correspondence with friends. They wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even did together a suppressed Images comic book, which was illustrated by the Shoili Kanungo. It described the future in which the President had toned down the Chelsea verdict and he could see the exhibition.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning's verdict only a few days after the comic book was released. It was a fortunate coincidence after seven hard years in a Finnish military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened at a time when Donald Trump is conducting his own war against the data-takers and transgender soldiers, and is still inventing new ways on Twitter to strengthen the powerful divisions he had in fact Mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has its purpose".
The gallery's wall contains an artist's statement and beneath it the great name of Manning, in which the last name I point is the heart. In its opinion, the artist demands the end of "The automatic division of Gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite wall is the Manning DNA section: A long string of C, G, and A with pencil.
With this combination of 200 – or nucleotide, as used by the artist – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are all, at least to Biologialtamme.
"I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal to our gene collection and that the gene data is very personal and open to interpretations," says Dewey-hagborg. The exhibition also showcases his spurious Memories video from 2007 to 1970.
"DNA tells countless stories. There are 30 of them on display here. "
The final work of the exhibition is in his room: the page of the comic book by Manning and Dewey-hagborg.
In it, Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, in his hand a megaphone.
"If they get you silenced, they have won," the picture says.
"Never keep silent."
"The text is from a letter I received from Mannheim," says the artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I'm still getting cold ripples."
In contrast to the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning comes to the scene, he is greeted by a face based on his genetic data as a group of demonstrators in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, like everything else in this show: for example, the DNA section of Manning is written in pencil at a height that is the same as his height (157.5 cm).
"The faces were on the wall before, but I wanted to bring a crowd feeling," Dewey-Hagborg explains.
"I wanted to photograph the mass movement of Chelsea, which was also behind his release."

"We are taking the actions of the Wada road map in the near future" – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vany Mutko
The Russian deputy prime minister, Vitaly Mutko, has said that Russia will soon complete the efforts of the World Anti-Doping Agency, the Wada road map, to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-doping committee, the ru100.
"Some of the measures under the road map have already been implemented, and Rusada was entitled to plan and Test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Committee (UKAAS).
The roadmap for WADA has been updated on this point, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the Wada road map, which sets out the conditions for restoring the powers of the ru100. The second part of the road map was recently published on the association's website.
According to the bend, it contains nothing worrying about Russia.
"Everything is announced, and everything is done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and to WADA in the near future, "Mutko added.
However, one of the points on the road map requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities publicly accept the results of the trial of Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, designated by WADA. McLaren investigates the state's alleged share of Russian sport in doping.
That is what you said: ' Research is underway, because our anti-doping system has acknowledged failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no State programmes, and we cannot admit what did not exist. "
The words of the nut were echoes of the statement by Vany Smirnov, president of the independent Public Anti-Doping committee in Russia.
In the past, in the same day as the Russian sports media, Rsport, he admitted that there have been problems in the anti-doping bodies in Russia. "We have said several times that there are controversial statements and provisions in the report.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally, but he added.
WADA ordered the ru100 to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015, when the scope of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it received permission to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the Ukadis.
In July, the director of WADA, Olivier Niggli, visited the headquarters of the ru100 in Moscow. After the visit, he stated that the association was "on the right track" towards restoring powers.
British organization skeptical of Finnish beloved innovations: the health benefits of maternity packaging are "no evidence"
The British Association suspects the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packs.
The BBC and the Guardian, among others, tell us that the lullaby Trust organization against Sudden Infant Death syndrome prohibits the use of its own brochures on maternity packs distributed in the UK.
The distribution of maternity packs to all pregnant women starts this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity pack would reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.
Sudden Infant death syndrome means the unexplained sudden death of the baby.
Lullaby Trust is an expert in British health officials for the child's safe sleep.
We no longer allow us to pack our official brochures, because it would suggest that we recommend this product, the organization announced.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, with only two deaths per 1000 births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland's good reading is a result of a variety of reasons, such as the low number of teine pregnancies.
The fact that there is a box for every family there may be one factor.
However, it cannot be said for sure, says Mr. Francine Bates, president of the Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packs are marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and sudden infant death syndrome.
Maternity pack is a Finnish invention and has been given in Finland for all mothers free for 80 years.
The pack contains a variety of accessories, such as children's clothes.
This year, the pack contains 53 products.
In fact, the packaging is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish government, the boxes it shares meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes.
According to Lullaby Trust, the pack may be the best option for sleeping if there is no cradle or crib available.
The organization recommends that you use the package for NAPs only and stop using it when the child can turn.
The organisation also recommends keeping pets away from the packaging and ensuring that it does not get wet or get dirty.
A nimble villain escaped from the Japanese zoo
The Japanese zoo staff is looking for runaway turtles.
The giant turtle has been surprised by the speed of the staff and has escaped for a second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawan Zoo in Okayam in western Japan on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain exited the zoo via the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very worried, said Yoshimi Yamane.
The runaway 35-year-old villain is female, 55-kilo and about a metre long.
Yamane describes Karkuri as quiet and gentle.
During opening hours the villain is allowed to travel freely in the garden area.
The zoo has not received eyewitness evidence of the turtle.
The last trip to the Konna was in the week before.
Yamane discovered the Karkuri by walking along the road 150 metres from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It is able to walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your business to avoid the Uber errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in the e-commerce startup company, but the polls didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured that the polls were anonymous, some employees were suspicious of them.
"The queries were simply not consistent and not objective," says Errett. As a hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on e-commerce. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside assistance.
The market has become more and more new start-ups for human resources, helping other companies to determine how their employees can.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement. Companies can query and target specific teams and groups of people and provide their employees with anonymous Notification Services and, in some cases, direct contact with the government over the top management.
"Your own health can be monitored with applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where do you stay with business Fitbit?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint-startup at Redwood City. Glint offers Business analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years. He says he has got a deeper view of the ideas and feelings of his employees.
The program can make quick polls and polls for specific teams. In addition, it can draw up a map showing at a glance which departments the workers are dissatisfied with and which leaders have received the weakest estimates. On this basis, Errett has been able to drill into the heart of the problems.
Companies have realised that they have to follow the culture of the workplace so that they do not become the next Uberia. The transport company around it has been castrated since a former employee wrote in his blog about a culture in which workers are harassed and those who speak problems are punished.
For startups like glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global sector whose value, under the Let's Talk payments website, can reach over 118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent is a startup in Denver, Colorado, helping businesses detect and prevent inappropriate behavior. Interest in the company grew earlier this year, when Uber's reputation experienced a blow.
Convercentilla has close to 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It recently concluded an agreement with Mr Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to make customised inquiries, collect confidential answers in real time, and identify problem areas.
In addition, employees may report inappropriate behaviour anonymously via SMS.
And if the director has reason to doubt the excesses, the complaints go directly to the company's board of directors.
"Public opinion has been superseded by public authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He recalls that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start to boycott the company, and it can also lose workers and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25 000 employees in 500 locations. The company has been using convercent for over a year, because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and are easily connected to the head office.
It was previously the practice that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to first find out the phone number or email address that was able to report to the head office. Then he had to make an official appeal and hope that it will be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says Ruby Tuesdayn general Counsel James Vitrano. According to him, the complaints made by employees were difficult to follow.
In the past, the problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state. Now, problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and treated more quickly.
"I get a more holistic and comprehensive view of the employee's reality," says Vitrano, who will lead the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders against the employment relationships."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take on ethics, values and the engagement of workers more seriously after the firm of Auditors, Arthur Andersen, collapsed as a result of unethical behaviour in connection with the Enron scandal.
It was only through social media that companies realised that they could no longer prevent the public clearing of their dirt-laundry.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology came to control ethics," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged.
It is a business model approved by capital investors and an opportunity. Both Glinti and Convercen have the support of private equity investors.
In February, Convercent collected $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital. It has accumulated capital of a total of 47 million dollars.
Glint received in November 10 million from Bessemer Venture partner Bridge and has amassed a total of 60 million dollars.
Investments are not surprising, given the links between business, business culture and venture capital.
Several studies suggest that employees expect more from their workplaces.
In a competitive market such as Silicon Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they give their time to a genuinely useful company.
"Employees are more committed to the success of the company if they thrive in the company and feel that they are listened to and rewarded for their work," says LinkedIn Manager, responsible for the remuneration and wellbeing of employees Nina McQueen.
Investors will receive returns when companies prosper. Companies are successful when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is no wonder that they are interesting to investors.
According to workplace culture experts, the commitment of information workers is important,
But it is useless if no action is taken on it.
If an enterprise requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered as a sign of change.
And if the change does not come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to undergo four thousand debates," says Russell Raath, director general of the management consultancy Kotter International, who has seen companies trusting too much for mere gathering of information.
"If the company does not take action, the employees start to consider whether they
and whether their opinions make any difference.
If the company does not care about them, why should they convey the company? "
According to Erretti, Madison Reed is currently working on a monthly basis and is able to seize the problem on the same day as it is announced in Glintti.
When Errett had gathered feedback about the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communications from frustrated workers, he was able to make changes to teams and organize communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is better at understanding its employees and hopes that deeper understanding will help to improve the sustainability of staff in an industry that is known for their high turnover.
"If a company does not commit itself to creating a transparency culture, it loses employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it will also lose customers.
And without customers there are no companies. "
In Sweden, the 20-year-old men are suspected of having a naked female neighbor, says news agency TT.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come home from a shower when she had noticed a mobile phone hanging from her window outside the rope.
According to the woman, the mobile camera photographed the apartment.
The woman who was scared of the incident had run into another room to wear.
When the woman had arrived to review the situation, the cell phone was pulled first up, but counted shortly after the window again.
A suspect 20-year-old man has admitted to imaging a woman.
However, he claimed to have only described the woman's face.
The video that was filmed on the mobile phone was removed and the police had failed to return it as proof.
In questioning, the man has admitted the deed, but he denied his guilt.
The man he described had reasoned by saying that he loves his neighbor "just crazy".
News agency TT says that a man is being prosecuted for a case.
Teachers call for more likso in autumn negotiations
Wage developments cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the difference should be narrowed down, said Olli Luuluki, president of the Oaj, on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public-sector holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements which do not in any way involve the provision of holiday cash cuts.
In the municipal sector, contracts will only be created after the private sector is signed and the percentages of increase are clear.
The bone predicts that the Oaj's working conditions, for example, have been agreed in January.
The percentage goals of the bone have not yet been revealed.
Lukko is also chairman of Juko, a well-trained consultative organisation.
Luke: Holiday money cut increases earnings development differences
According to Oaj, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is deteriorating while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing at the same time.
According to the skeleton, temporary holiday money cuts further the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, the number of pupils per teacher can be defined as
Oaj points out, moreover, that equality of basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the weakest are constantly increasing.
According to the association, the learning outcomes are weakened and the differences between pupils and regions are constantly increasing.
The day of the Bruins players, when the NCAA reduced the daily exercises from two to one
The clock will soon be eleven o'clock in the evening. A group of UCLA:n American football players have been left to talk to another side of the campus's new training courses.
Some have stripped their game shirt. The shiny sweat of their backs after the first day of the training camp.
Time for many of them this few minutes of chatting is a midday break.
After three hours of exercises, players studying at the university's summer courses return to the residence to read final exams. The next morning they meet half of the seven at the Wasserman Football Centre.
"The next three days will be in the rankings for these guys," Bruce's coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday's change to Tuesday.
The umbrella organization of university Sport reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one. The purpose of the change was to lighten the workload of the players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final exams are held.
That's why UCLA:n three of the first exercises started to be grafted over seven in the evening. It was difficult to find space for the players already in the full schedule.
Limiting the number of placements in a single day means more training days. The camp started this year almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in the reign of Moran during the coaching season, when the exercises are held at the same time as the summer courses.
The exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before the 20th of August. The day of the start of the actual preparation for the season's opening match: UCLA encounters the Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says that it has supported the NAAA's rule change, even though it made the players ' schedules even stricter.
"We load them for a lot of three or four days, and it's very challenging," says Mora.
"But the players are ready to work. They are great friends.
I believe that the situation will be facilitated when we get to Saturday. Then we will have more time.
UCLA closes the rehearsal after the outside camp. It is not easy, considering the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent car park and the Luski Center, an excellent hotel that has already been bombed by the footballs flying over the perimeter of the Paintpan.
The Bruins players are expected to change the hotel this weekend, but Mora admits that problems may arise during the season when the rooms are available to third parties.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and describe there exercises for video. It is not an exaggerated concern.
The video that is described in the exercises is paid quite a lot.
But we have guards there and in the parking area.
We will do our best.
I am not going to bother too much about my head.
We have a plan. "
Freedom in Rwanda
A presidential election is taking place on Friday in Central African Rwanda, the winner of which will be taken for granted.
Paul Kagame formally strives for his third season, but in practice he has influenced the country's leadership since 1994.
Then the rebel group RPF ended the genocide that was organized by the extremists.
Kagame was commander of the RPF.
Kagamea has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of expression.
He has also been accused, for example, of distorting poverty statistics.
For the third season, the Kagame is in the effort, because the constitution was changed to the two-season presidential term.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely held leader.
In the course of his time, there have been social reforms in Rwanda and international investment has flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagamella has played a major role in uniting the country that has been divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether the liberal Monipuoluedemokratia is the right model for African countries.
However, it has promised his people more freedom after the country has been brought to its feet.
Now might be a good moment to start.
Facebook fights fake news against enhanced fact verification
Facebook is going to send potential bogus news to more and more independent fact inspectors as well as to present the results of the original article below. The world's largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify bogus news. Any bogus news will be sent to the fact inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest bogus news distributors. Many people believe that bogus news was influenced by the US president's election performance in 2016.
The subject has emerged in a political debate in Europe, in which the French voters were bombarded with bogus news before the May presidential election and Germany, preparing for the September elections, supports the plan for social media networks If they do not remove the hateful content urgently.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement in Germany that fact-checking is being tested in the USA, France, Holland and Germany.
"People want to see which stories do not pass through independent inspectors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more enlightened what they read and share, "says Sara Su, the Facebook News Feed product manager, wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook continues to test related articles and makes other changes to the news feed to reduce bogus news.
Comic book Origins: The Story of a castle
The small Scotney Castle in Kent is now known as the Squeeze music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout from 1970 to 1980.
However, it has 700 years of turbulent history behind him. Now with a picturesque location in the Bewli River valley, this castle is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a mophupic writer of old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to look at the text written by a deceased person over 300 years ago," says Rhodes.
"I feel a personal connection when I am holding a letter in my hand."
The Book of Rhodes, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families who lived in Scotbe from the Middle Ages to the Edvardianera. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes ' first book based on archives. In 2014, he appeared Dead men's Teeth and Other Stories, whose inspiration were documents from the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I moved to tears when I noticed a thumb trace in my letter. The letter was written by a double agent in 1700, "says Rhodes.
"It was his fingerprints!
And the letters are fragrant from smoke, because at that time the fire was used as a lighting.
Three centuries later, the scent makes the reader feel that he is on the ground.
I love the archives! "
The author of the old documents was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council of England, which seemed too good to be true. He admits that he would not be immediately in the castle for a little longer than it would have hoped.
He spent the days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, the archives, the treasures and the curios, such as the hyenas hanging on the walls and the bottles of centuries in the moat.
He toured with the ruins and orders of the old castle and discussed with the forest guards, the gardeners, and sometimes the artists who illustrated the book.
In the evenings, he "took whiskey and began writing".
The closer history of Scotney is quite unknown, as the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the last heir, Elizabeth Husseyn, Death in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived on the scene ten years later, the foundation's staff were just starting to go through the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years using the same method: by exporting all the extra attic.
The archives had diaries, letters from the English Empire and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that the land conflicts are boring," says Rhodes. "Here, however, the families fought even one birch.
It came to mind that I might already be given. "
Some of the stories in the book proceed from the Castle to English history, such as The labourer. It is about a man who is soon to be associated with a peasant revolt in England in 1381.
"The knightly families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," says Rhodes.
"The Peasant rebellion in England began in the same region, and it came to mind that rebellion can begin in a riot.
Maybe these events are interconnected? "
The other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, the story of a priest, who was hiding seven years in the Arrelli family during the Reformation of England.
The smuggler again tells The secret driver of Arthur Darrelli's story from The 1700 century. He is said to have completed his own funeral by filling the rocks (it was discovered years later when his tomb was opened).
The darrelit are the Rhodes ' favorite family in Scotbe. "The men of the family seem to have been considerable the little guys. They were constantly in debt and bought things they could not afford.
The men of the genus Darrelli solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women. I see them as handsome friends who were flying over the heir. "
Now Rhodes is searching for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about the hill of life, a sanatorium in the early 1900, from which only a plot of eutrophication remains.
Scotney's Linna has a special place in her heart.
"It was sad to leave from there," he says.
"I would not have wanted to go back to this evil everyday."
The worst in Russia since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated markedly, commented on the NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg stated in an interview with Cnn's.
After the end of the cold War, we hoped that we could try to close cooperation with Russia.
But since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the constant instability caused by Russia in eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, Nato is still committed to working in such a way that tensions are not tightened.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid the escalation of the situation and the new Cold War.
Before the comments of Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump of the United States managed to find that the US and Russia had drifted to a dangerously poor level.
Trump urged to thank the countries for the bad terms of Congress, which last week approved the new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitshko Stop-reply to Anthony Jeshua does not happen
The professional boxing longtime heavyweight champion Vladimir Klitshko finishes his career.
The Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
At the Olympic Games in Atlanta, 1996, he won a professional 69 times, winning the matches in 64.
He held various championship titles between 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost in his last two games.
Tyson Fury struck him in scoring in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitshko faced a Wembley at the stadium with Anthony Jeshua and lost to knockout in the first fight. Installments.
Jeshua and Klitshko were expected to face a replay match in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko did not find any motivation for the match.
I deliberately used a few weeks to make a decision in order to get enough distance to the Wembley match, Klitshko said in a newsletter.
I arrived as an amateur and professional boxer for everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after the sport.
I would never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See the justification for this decision on video.
Mr. Bernd Bönte, the manager of Klitshko, said in the newsletter that the decision to cease was a difficult task.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he has no longer enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, said Bönte.
Klitshko has been dating since 2009 with the American actor Hayden Panettiere.
The couple has one child, the daughter of Kaya, who was born in 2014.
His older brother, Vitali, is also a former heavyweight champion.
Between the years 2008-12, the two brothers dominated the various federations of the world at the same time.
The Finnish weatherbreaker is the circumstances: "Take the Fiilas"
The pole vaulter Minna Nikkanen has been suffering from the circumstances during the summer's outer iron period.
Minna Nikksella has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken the woman from the Fiilis.
There are unstable conditions in the London World Cup.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
The circumstances have been in this Suvena pole vault against Minna Nikkasta.
I would not like to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I did not even get the small poles to move properly, Nikkanen said after the race in Innsbruck.
I have competed and practiced here who knows how many times and I have never experienced an equally varied breeze in this place, Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin in games.
During this season, it has been very difficult to standardize the jump, as there have been such unstable winds in the rehearsals, Nikkanen said in the Kalevala competitions.
The weather was spoken on Thursday Lontoossakin.
Time-wasting has been to get a technique in the pile-whether it's cold-hung or what.
It has been cold and windy, and it has taken the fiilis.
There is no point in consuming energy in a bad circumstance.
In 455 he was inducted into the World Championships.
Outdoors has gone 445.
The circumstance is not the same in London.
Must be a restraint and expect better winds.
The goal is to exceed Friday's qualifier 460.
Why not change your training abroad?
It is not necessary.
Last summer I was in the beginning of the season in Italy and Germany.
I got a jump heap and the technology standard.
I think we should have done the same thing now.
The hall has now been closed.
What would be the race for the Ihanna?
25 degrees warm.
It's a small breeze as long as it's standard.
An experienced ex-official was at the heart of the noble politicians: "We have no room for manoeuvre now and not for many years"
Despite the positive economic climate, Juha Sipilä 's board of directors must keep the ice in the air and beware of the government budget inflated by debt, warns the Ministry of finance budgets for decades, prepared by Erkki Virtanen.
According to him, there is no division.
Yle was interviewed in 2015 with a live stream on Wednesday's number one.
The state of next year's budget building is just beginning.
In recent times, the politicians ' proposals, including the raising of the guarantee pension, the calculation of the car tax and the support of electric bicycles, have been highlighted as electioneering.
They mainly tell us that the elections are starting to be close, because when ten per cent of the state budget is funded by the extra debt, we have no room for manoeuvre now, nor for many years.
I think it is even a deception to talk about splitting up when debt is taken, says Virtanen.
Virtanen emphasized that all debt is owed to children.
Virsella has long experience in preparing government budgets: In 1978 he began as a secretary of the Treasury in the Ministry of Finance and then worked as assistant manager and budget manager of the budget department.
Last time he retired, he was the head of the Ministry of Labour and the economy.
In an interview with YLE, Virtanen pointed out that the now projected 3% economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All the predicers estimate that this is the spike that we are going to go to in the lower back next year, and Finland expects a 1 percent growth for tens of years.
Washington amends permanent Residence rules
According to the media, President Donald Trump stated that the rules of the permanent residence, the Green card, were amended by a new Maahanmuuttosuunnitelmalla.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per annum, to tighten the requirements of temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
The new rules are suggested by Republicans, and the president supports them.
The draft law is due to be debated in the two Chamber of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers ' money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current program.
The new application process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have the skills to gain from our economy, "Trump said according to the media.
The Queen of Denmark's spouse does not want to be buried with the Queen in the same place
Prince Henrik does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margaret were photographed in April.
The Queen of Denmark, Margaret, 77, and his spouse, Prince Henriä, 83, are not to be buried next to each other, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, ruler couples in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The King's room today announced that Prince Henrik did not want to be buried at Roskilde Cathedral, the Court notes in a statement on Thursday.
According to the BT magazine, the reason is that the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, says Lene Belleby, head of communications, in the journal.
A decision by a prince not to be buried alongside the Queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as equal with the spouse.
According to Hovin, the Queen has long been conscious of the desire for the burial site of her spouse and understands the decision.
A moment of horror on the road: the car had to come on the freeway
The tomato had a housemate and two small children aboard.
They were not injured in an accident but are not receiving insurance money if the other party cannot be contacted.
The accident took place at the Keimogate in Vantaa.
Archive image of Perimeter III construction site.
In the accident, Tommi says that his family has survived a miracle car crash on Tuesday.
Tommi, his unmarried partner Riina and the two small children of the couple drove on the motorway in Vantaa, in the direction of Keimolanport, towards Hämeenlinna.
From the exit of Ring III to Hämeenlinnanväli, a white car was driving along the acceleration lane, and Tommy says.
Without the Dodge movement, the car would have been turned on.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it went out of control, "says Tommi.
The family car collided with a loud-speed railing.
The parents and the two small children in the backseat were not injured.
One of the children is just under 3 years old, one less than a year old.
It was a pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No one was driven, not even in the direction of us, even though the place had a lively traffic.
The accident occurred around at 17.20.
According to the most, no one stopped to join them, and the family called the Emergency centre.
They got out of the car on their own.
The ambulance and rescue staff came to the scene and the condition of the family was revised.
The car went into a redemption condition.
Tommi says he and his unmarried partner have a small income, and they received a grant from Suvulta for the purchase of the car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of another car, the family will not receive the insurance money.
This is why the family hopes to witness witnesses in the car that led the family to the railing.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take your children to the orchard and work without it, "says Tommi.
Tommi saw that the car was white, an elderly car.
It was probably the end of the 1990, or the beginning of the 2000 century.
He thought the beginning of the car's registration number was SIG.
If the blame is not adhered to, I do not know how financially we are doing, today we are counting every cent.
Tommi hopes that the things that have been seen or know about it are in contact with the police.
The police Department of the East Uusimaa and the rescue services of Central Uusimaa confirmed that they had a job on the spot on Tuesday night.
The title and story were fixed at 21.15: Unlike what was originally reported in the story, the other car did not come to the oncoming band, but instead had to drive the car to the side of the family's vehicle.
The show by Lotta Jäppinen discusses human relationships with humor-the self-complainant is seen in what?-Theatre on Friday and Saturday
A Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings his directorial debut to the What? Theatre.
The self-complainant is a musical theatre show of the past, of relationships and inadequacy.
According to the director Lotta Jäppinen, it still leaves a good feeling.
The topic is treated with humor.
The unpleasant feelings do not go to the wayside, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the travelling summer theatre performance has been implemented with a small budget and a big, young heart.
The name of the presentation challenges the reflection of what a person reveals about himself in his new man's acquaintance.
Does he perhaps have a role or is the second coat approaching?
The Schematon presentation mixes Fakta and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatized the performance.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The proposal consists of a group of texts and does not contain a plot.
The instructor believes that, although the presentation draws on the ideas of young people, it speaks of all ages.
Jäppinen emphasizes that the self-complainant does not directly describe his own or the working Group's relationships.
Fact and fiction become mixed.
I am sure my world of values will be conveyed from the presentation.
I do not think that relationships are bad, but I do not believe that a relationship, especially a relationship, is a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from the divorced from their parents
Jäppinen believes that the self-complainant draws up the current picture of young adults living in a hundred years old Finland.
According to him, many have learned a lot about relationships with from their parents, many of whom have resigned.
At least that you have to listen to yourself.
There is no need to miss a bad relationship.
The presentation stars Minea Lång, Niklas rauté and Otto Rokka.
The team also includes the costume and Ella Snellman.
The musical arrangement is the most.
Love for theatre caught in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola, 26, studying for theatre expression at the Turku Polytechnic Academy of Arts.
The rear is two years and in front of another mokoma.
The enthusiasm of the theatre has begun during the Kouvola-years.
The music classes have been a contributor to the Kouvola Theatre and have starred in, among others, the Matriculation Theatre in Helsinki and the last Castle Theatre in Turku.
The steering is becoming more and more interested.
Last week, the self-complainant premiered at the Narri scene in Helsinki.
A presentation of about 45 minutes in the future will also be seen at least in the city of Turku.
Self-revealing the Kouvola what?-theatre 4.8. At 19 and 5.8. At 14 and 19.
The Finnish Olympic champion recovered from the Karmesta motocrossaccident of the year-the cervical spine broke
Few athletes in Finland have a similar unstoppable natural force as Janne Lahtela.
The mogul bill in the Ace toured the world for hundreds of days a year for a couple of ten years and chased the dream of the Olympic gold.
The dream was accomplished in 2002, but the business of Lahtela continued.
He was not only a tireless trainee, but also a new species Experimor.
There is probably no form of physical activity on Earth that Kemijärveläinen should not have tried at least once.
It has been inspired to practice.
There's always something new, says Lahtela.
Finally, one hobby was to stop the sect altogether.
In 2014, Lahtela was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I was nowhere to work.
Nodding wounds in my house for a year, Lahtela says.
Lahtelalla was bad luck.
He also admits that age could have played a part in the accident.
It may sound wild.
But I have applied for borders.
It's just kind of so hard that it's not too much to practise in this forties!
After the accident, Lahtela got into a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
In the back was a long Rupeama Japanese freestyle team head coach.
Lahtela started in the nest right after his own career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15 years old, I had to be in my place.
I actually did almost nothing, says Lahtela.
In the coaching yard, Lahtela often challenged his protégé in slope and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so tired, physically and mentally, that my thoughts did not feel sensible.
Not even in the sport.
Made it good to be in place.
I really enjoyed it because I really got it for once just to be.
Mandatory break Insti Lahtela Finland's main coach.
Without stopping he is afraid that would be burned out.
It is easier to find places that have gone out of the Croat than intact!
Without any accident I wouldn't have figured out that I needed to rest so much.
Lahtela began his career as a Finnish freestyle national team about a year ago.
At the same time he found a safer hobby to replace the flywheel species.
I changed the motoracrosit to Frisbeegolf!
The staff were very helpful.
At worst, I was seven hours a day throwing up.
Even though Lahtela has always been a super-keen training enthusiast, he doesn't require his companions to be the same as he does.
I don't force everyone into the same mold.
Our kind of culture has the space to be unique and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in keeping with it, Lahtela says.
Sex robots come and we need to be worried
It's here: a report on technology development in the sex robot industry – just when it was beginning to feel that the year 2017 can no longer become more strange.
Yes only.
Sex robots are now a big deal.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) has recently published a report on the development of sex robots within the next 5 to 10 years.
"We must start taking a serious approach to the generalisation of sex robots," says founding member of the Foundation and Professor emeritus of Robotics and artificial intelligence at Noel Sharkey Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the colour of the robot's eye color, nipple shape and finger nail type.
"The sex robots are being chuckted, but they are already being sold quite a lot, and we will see them even more," Sharkey said at the release of the report.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm silicone skin and artificial intelligence features that resemble human use.
The user can also adapt the robot to its own preferences, ranging from eye-color nipples to finger nail type and color.
It is all the more worrying that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freeholders.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of a Realbotix robot can be customized to suit the user's preferences, such as a swim.
True Companion's Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah is influenced by a swim, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"Roxxxy Goldin's personality adapts as fully as possible to the personality of the user," the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, thing in the mood or "in the mood".
There are many worrying features in the generalisation of sex robots. They replace genuine interpersonal relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies when the user approaches, for example, a robot programmed to swim and resist.
True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot on its website with a vibrator:
"Women have a vibrator. Why shouldn't men have a sex robot? "
Sex robots, however, are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalisation and development is about something of a darker and deeper culture: a downturn in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, in which a subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, the majority of men are not getting a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report is about their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit of the time.
And many start behaving strangely or offensive only when the market authorises it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots are beginning to become more common at a time when women's rights are threatened around the world and the White House sits with a president who has kehuskellut been harassed by women.
The Handmilk's Tale (the "maidservant") in the television series is not the most worrying of its powerful imagery, for example, images of hanged bodies and out of dug eyes. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from Todellisuudestamme, but right now it seems like a surprisingly short trip.
We try to do so much about sex robots like real women (pornstars) than is technically possible.
Robots developers want their skin to feel real and the movements mimic the best possible human movements.
Their "personalities" are, however, far from reality.
The robot is unable to leave the relationship or situation.
They have neither the will nor the history of their own — there is no reference to independence or breaking the fantasy of complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Orjatattaria.
Police suspects: Two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, the group was led by the chief
The head of the extremist organization, Isisin, led a group of Australian men suspected of exporting a suunnitelleen bomb to the aircraft Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Lord, the person who was the leader of the Isisin leaders also sent Sydney bomb building parts.
According to suspicion, the bomb was to be taken to the airplane on 15 September. The company was interrupted before the security check.
The police did not explain further why the company was interrupted.
The second suspected terrorist plan was to build a toxic, colourless gas-consuming device and to take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport medium.
Australian Federal deputy Commissioner Michael Phelis says that the terrorists ' plan was one of the most professional plans of what Australia has ever done.
Because of the alleged terrorist plans, four men were caught in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but also his questioning continues.
Trump's virtues?
Makes Mitt Romney look like a sense of common sense
In the trumpet season, it has already been repeated that the strong divisions of the electorate have also scattered the families on a daily basis.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspaper Helpdesks were guided through the forums to see how the Truter with the relatives who voted.
We all want to pierce our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to the trumpet's ability to unite families.
I will tell you about this because my cousin was a villile this week in my home in New York. He is a left-wing poet from Chicago who has long been on the buttons against our family Republican.
He recalled that the common enemy could have a strong unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousin all acquaintances – even the Republican sibling with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades – are suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
At the dinner table it is a good thing, but more broadly, it involves significant risks.
Trump has given left a new stream, but the distorting effect of his presidential term can actually deprive us all to the right.
When we talk about the trumpet and the ' normalization ', we are talking about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be horrified by his tricks.
In the long run, there is even more terrible chance that Trump will normalizes the Republicans in the right extreme, who suddenly seem to be quite sensible compared to the truer.
I recall the subdued version of Mitt Romney, a dog on the roof of the car, a 14% income tax (and he has seen his tax return). Compared to Truas, they seem to be very mild in their transgressions.
When the trumpet season is over, the next Republican presidential candidate needs to be just clear-headed, and it seems like an immediate improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to carousel the Central Park. It's the New York Park-department's biggest carousel and the best thing about New York gets for three dollars without caffeine.
Carousel horses are huge, in the middle of the characters – grotesque clowns and the animals watching terror – are ominous, and the underlying music of screaming is strangely fascinating.
Many of the New York's hallmarks are becoming disappointing over time: the views of the tall buildings are getting bored, the city silhouette becomes too familiar and the reality of the city is not in line with dreams.
And I still did not get over the 35 years, that the Swiss cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large roundabout in north London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage though is a Swiss-style pub, but it is not counted.
The carousel on the Central Park is still a strange magical experience – even to the extent that the two-year-old, one yksitoistavuotias and two forties women enjoy it enormously.
I would have given Karusellille a full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but luckily nobody came to ask.
Instead, I was asked this week in the department store to evaluate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card into the reader.
The same thing is in the café at my corner, but there is also a possibility for me to combine the 15% service allowance with the estimate when I visit the coffee counter.
This slows down the interplay of interaction and pressure on the customer service to put his persona in a game in a situation where it is not needed.
The department store's saleswoman smiled in a sorry state when I was tired of giving five stars the experience of my credit card.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from the Interi-"There was no management trust"
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuqin Club's trainer for the role of the coach of the team.
Coaching responsibility is taken by the former assistant coach, Fabrizio Piccareta.
The other coaching team will continue to carry out their current duties.
The Italian Piccareta has worked as an assistant coach in the former English-language Sunderland.
In January, the 51-year-old Piccareta has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
FC Interin Chairman of the Board of Directors Stefan Håkans regrets the incident.
Changing a trainer is never an easy or enjoyable task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the confidence of the club management, so there was no other option at present, Håkans commented in the club's bulletin.
The Piccareeta agreement is valid until the end of the season.
Together with the rest of the coaching team, he is responsible for a home game in tomorrow against Hifch.
According to the information in the evening messages, the team has been castrated throughout Thursday.
Kuqi told Thursday morning to the players that the club's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta took a strong interest in the international match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius released her youthful picture from the 80 century-did you recognize a serious violin student?
Violin Taituri Linda Lampenius released a youth picture on Instagram.
A number of hästägjä have been added to the picture, which can be inferred from the figure that the musician is a 16-year-old student of Sibelius Academy.
Brava itself wonders about a young woman who sees a serious camera.
Long ago, serious, he signin.
If you don't see the picture, you can view it here.
Brava has previously published pictures of her past and also talked about painful topics.
Over a year ago, he released a pair of pictures of himself on Instagram.
In the second picture he is seen 20 years ago, in the second he posing now, as mother of two children.
In the image text, Brava discusses her own growth as a human being and refers to the eating disorders that she suffered at a younger age.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look much the same as the 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to keep myself and what I look like, Brava wrote.
After the text he had added in English the hashtags of life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love Yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Brava has spoken openly about her eating out in previous years.
He was already at the age of fourteen in the hospital for anorexia and Orthopia.
A little later, he also became ill with bulimia, which was finally uncovered only in 2006.
Healing began slowly.
In addition to therapy and comparison, Brava helped a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to hospital for breast pain
This is the second time that Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital treatment for the incisions in his wrists, which according to the prison authorities he had fallen in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder of prosecutors who complained about the original death sentence.
He slew Steenkamp's Valentine's Day in the early hours of 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have thought the girl his friend a nocturnal intruder who was hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have said that they are going to complain again, for they consider the six-year sentence of the pistorism to be too minor.
The attorney general intends to complain to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal will be dealt with possibly already this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the order of the pistorism may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgarian refugees arrested for illegal camps in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarian Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, announcing the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs according to the bTV channel.
The police arrested a number of people who had been camped in Siholnia on August 1. Morning. Among the campers were two Bulgarian citizens.
They were still released on the same day, but the investigation of the case continued.
According to the television channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced the release of the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules on free camp sites and are already making substantial fines for all those who are camping in areas other than those reserved for the purpose.
Inspections shall continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry stated that the right may impose a fine.
Liquid share sinks-already sunk-7.7%

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a digestive system.
However, recent research claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may help irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable Bowel syndrome is an incurable disease, suffering from about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in the UK. It causes abdominal cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, loss of weight and extreme fatigue.
Sufferers of irritable bowel syndrome are generally advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, the Washington University researchers found that the essential amino acid in protein contained in tryptophan helps the body develop immune cell resistance to strengthen intestinal resilience.
According to the research director, Marco Colonne, the immune cells guard the swamp and ensure that the harmful microbes in the food do not penetrate the body.
Cells that stabilize inflammatory cells that strengthen resilience. They protect the body from damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance drops too close to inflammation, the result may be irritable bowel syndrome.
The tests found that the immune-tolerance to strengthen resilience is in mice with a certain bacterium in the gut.
This bacterium needs tryptophan in order to start to emerge from the immune cell. Tryptophan is one of the building materials of proteins.
"We found a connection between the Lactobacillus and the development of cells that foster resilience. Lactobacillus Reuteri is a part of the gut's normal microbes, "says Professor Colonna.
"The more the diet of mice was tryptophan, the more they had such immune cell."
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus-edged bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen the intestinal resilience and reduce the susceptibility to inflammation.
In the examination of immune-enhancing immunity, the post-doctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Baragan found that, although one mouse group had such cells, it was not in mice of the same mouse type, which were kept separate from the other group.
He doubted that the difference was related to the mice in the intestinal microbious, i.e. the digestive tract to the regular bacteria, fungi and viruses in the community.
After examination of the intestinal DNA of mice, six species of bacteria were detected in mice with immune-cell tumours but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus of the reuteri bacteria were given in a sterile environment to mice that did not have any intestinal microbes and for which no developed immune cell tumours were found, immune cell development began to occur.
Researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They increased the Lactobacillus of rheumatoid bacteria in the liquid and transferred small amounts of fluids – without bacteria – from isolated to unmature immune nodes.
The immune cells developed to strengthen resilience.
When the active ingredient was cleaned from the liquid, it turned out to be a side product of the tryptophan metabolism known as the Inboli-3 milk acid.
When scientists doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of cells that strengthen resilience increased by about 50%. When the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus-edged bacteria in our food smelting channel.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria cells develop in humans in the same way as mice. However, in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, tryptophane-related genetic defects have been observed.
"We would certainly like to promote the development of such cells, because they regulate the inflammation on the casings inner surfaces," says Cervantes-Barangan.
"A high tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus-edged bacteria may contribute to their penetration."
Jose Mourinho felt that Manchester United got his ranks "Nero" after concluding an agreement with Nemanja Maticin
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got his ranks "Nero" after concluding an agreement with Nemanja Maticin. The midfielder debuted at Manchester United with a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
With a 40 million pound from Chelsea, Matic started with a 2 – 1 win in Dublin, the last season in United, before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed against the stars, such as the midfielder Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not yet in the best shape because he was not involved in the blue shirts on an Asian tour before the season began. He scored in the field for only 45 minutes – according to Mourinho, the change before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, and way of thinking make him genius – he has an inherent sense of football," Mourinho says.
"We'll help him be prepared sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matics, the newcomers Victor lingeof and Ronoise Lukaku were embarking on a game at the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho began to line up his starting lineup for the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants three new players, even though the club has already done a "splendid job" by acquiring three of his four priority players.
"Three out of four – you have to give thanks to the club," he added.
"I'm happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."

Reuters: The great jury has already posted challenges for the Trump JR Russia meeting
In the United States, the great jury has sent out challenges related to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The great jury convened by the Attorney-General, Robert Mueller, has already sent a challenge in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr and the Kremlin, the renowned Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
It is reported by Reuters, which at the same time confirms the Wall Street journal information that was revealed earlier on Thursday by the convening of a large jury.
According to Reuters, the large jury has sent out challenges related to the meeting of the Trump Jr and the Kremlin, a famous Veselnitskaya, which was held during the United States presidential election in June 2016.
There were also Paul Manatfort, the then-campaign manager of Donald Trump Sr and his son, Jared Kushner, the current advisor to the White House.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that the specialist prosecutor, Robert Mueller, convened a large jury in Washington, represents a deepening of the pace of the Russian investigation.
The sources add that Mueller wanted a large jury to assist the investigation, which seeks to investigate Russia's interference in the US presidential election and whether the trumpet campaign or his entourage cooperated with Russia.
The great jury expands Mueller's rights to collect evidence, sends challenges and forces people to witness the oath.
The great jury is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The large jury will weigh up the evidence identified by the prosecutor's investigation and decide whether to prosecute the case.
British inventor Mikrosirutti himself to reach his home and car with a flick of the hand
The British inventor in the whole country has been the first to microbe able to open his home door, get to his office and start his car with a flick of the hand.
The microchip is 33-year-old Steven Northamin between the thumb and forefinger. Now he offers a service to companies and individuals who want to make life easier with Northamin Bioteq technology.
Northam is collaborating with Geoff Watson, a medical anaesthetical doctor at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, where the installation of a microchip meets medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technique as the microchips in cats and dogs, and it only takes 30 seconds to install.
Northamin company also changes the locks of houses and cars to compatible with the microchip. Single lock processing costs 300 pounds.
She is married and has one child. He has installed the microchip technology in both his home and BMW Z4 car, which starts when he drops his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House's exhibition item cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's last decision to send a naval helicopter to the White House to the southern grassy event of the American production was to pay the taxpayer 24 000 dollars. The information is reflected in the military documents received by TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3d helicopter is referred to as Marine One when the president is on the ride. It was a veto at the White House 17.7.2017 at the event which introduced American building programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pance and a number of White House officials became acquainted with the products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, there were also sailing boats from Maine, fire truck Wisconsinista and forklift Mississipistä.
The military office of the White House had asked the helicopter to be ordered by task only about 36 hours before landing on the southern grassy field for the "exceptional" event. This is evident from the documentation of the naval HMX-1 helicopter fleet.
"I just wanted to make sure that you are aware of this, because this is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 commander wrote the event on the day prior to his supervisor, who is the naval Assistant commander of the flight.
The message reported that the helicopter would arrive at the southern grassy field 17.7. Seven o'clock in the morning and the event would begin at three o'clock this afternoon. The helicopter would leave the place only after the grassy field was emptied between six and nine in the evening.
In addition, it was mentioned that if the helicopter departure from a White House would delay, a second crew would need to be present due to limitations of service times.
The original crew had a helicopter at the time of the event, and the unit's security staff was on the helicopter when it was in the country.
It is not clear from the documents received by TIME magazine whether another crew was needed.
The United States ' hatch ACT prohibits federal workers from using state assets for political purposes.
According to the documents, the HMX-1 inquired, whether event law.
"One of our questions was whether the hatch Act was violated here. We were told not to be broke, "the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the assistant commander replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House and was not covered by the hatch Act.
But the official events have political hues.
At the time, the president spoke in favour of a health reform in the Senate, and a more lax state regulation.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them on their travels,
But using them only for photographs is unusual.
The action of the trumpet attracted attention in February when Air Force One hit the background of the presidential campaign in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which introduced products from American workers from all the 50 states of the US," said the White House press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews regularly carry out training flights in the Washington area and practice the presidential introductions to the White House in the southern grassy field, with centimeters.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 made a 58 training landing for the White House.
According to one officer, flights to Made in America were included in the crew's monthly training quota.
On that date, the unit's helicopters were also flown for 11 hours in "non-presidential support missions".
According to the White House, no other costs were incurred by the taxpayer.
Sikorsky's spokesman reported that the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter demonstration in the White House on the southern grassy ground.
HMX-1 does not have any accounts for presidential missions, and it is difficult to assess the costs of the event.
According to the Department of Defense's 2017 hour allowances, the VH-3d helicopter compensation level is 24 380 in flight hours.
According to the documentation of the HMX-1 unit, flights from the Quansco base to the White House and back lasted a total of one hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are significantly lower.
"The calculation of the costs to the taxpayer according to the level of compensation is misleading," says Walters.
"The estimated compensation level includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs, which are taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a survey carried out by the RAND research company in 2015, reimbursement levels do not include staff costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
During the event, the White House former press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to showcase American productions," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in securing national security, and will certainly employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think that, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans have worked.
It is perfectly appropriate to bring this about. "
It is not certain whether the Trump will be on the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat down with the driver of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump joked with the press on his own Sikorsky Squadron.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president. "I have three of them."

The state prosecutor in Venezuela insists on the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative
The state prosecutor in Venezuela has applied for a court decision which would prevent the new representative country from being appointed.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that last Sunday's vote on the selected Representative Council is scheduled to be nominated on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a representative council was chosen for the country, which could, among other things, change the country's constitution.
The chief prosecutor, Luisa Ortega, says that the decision to prevent a rejection has been taken because of a suspicion of electoral fraud.
Ortega has also started a vote on electoral fraud.
He appointed two judges for the task after the British company that held the Representative council vote said that the results have been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about a million higher than the number of actual voters.
The representative of the Council was limited to the allies of Madurso, and the elected representatives of the 545 Member States include Maduron's son and wife.
In addition to amending the Constitution, Representative Council can break up the opposition led by Congress and change laws.
The dictator Madoro
Maduron's actions are widely condemned.
The opposition considers modifying the Constitution as a means of madurso to strengthen its position.
The United States has imposed the maddule sanctions and called this dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have, in turn, declared that they do not recognise the new representative.
Maduro argues that the new Representative Council is a solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, the unrest has been continuing for months.
They have wounded numerous people and more than a hundred have died.
Venezuela sank into the economic crisis after the fall in oil prices.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicines.
The Opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday when the new representative is to be launched.

In the opinion, Finland and the United States were accused of being detained in Finland without the Russian way in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used the computer virus Ebury, which grabbed tens of thousands of computers all over the world.

According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women
Elections are only representative if they can vote for all members of society, including women, said the head of the UN delegation to Afghanistan on Wednesday.
The provisional director of the UN assistance delegation, Nicholas Haysom, said that the elections to the provincial councils are nominated for hundreds of women, three women seeking vice-president and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," says Haysom in an opinion on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan provincial council and presidential elections are held in 5.4.2017.
The Taliban have put forward the threat of elections at the same time as the international troops are turning to the consultative role.
This year's elections are the first time that the power moves peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women's contribution strengthens Afghan democracy.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Committee, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

Flood threat of certain types of tourists to the region's culture
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The local Fury is directed particularly at the representation of the cruise ships in the form of tourism.
The Italian Minister of culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: The destinations are only a few hours and are being rushed through large numbers of attractions.
Venice is a very quick day trip to the city's tourists.
In narrow streets it is difficult to move and the fine squares are so crowded that the people of Venice are no longer able to fit into the ranks.
They have been forced to move further away from the historical centre, while homes have been replaced by hotels.
The New York Times and the Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
Public authorities are considering restrictions on tourist amounts.
They call the current phenomenon of poor quality tourism-low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, time is given for two or three hours.
You follow the flag-keeping guide from Piazzale Roma to Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and turn back, describing the prevailing and problematic tourism of the Italian Cultural minister Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of our cities.
St Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in the historic center of Venice.
St. Mark's Basilica is located on the market square.
Local indignation is also mainly directed towards cruise ships.
The historic centre of Venice is now home to 50 000 local.
In 1951 residents were around 175 000.
In July, an estimated 2 000 veneans protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives the inhabitants away.
Approximately 2 000 inhabitants depart every year.
If this continues, in a few years ' time Venice will not be like tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical catastrophe, says Carlo Belframe.
The equation is difficult because the ships bring Venice its desperately needed income and create the need for a number of jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it is envisaged that cruisers would go further away from the historical centre.
Luciano Bortot, a resident of Venice, would certainly change the situation if the administrative area of Veneto, where Venice is located, would gain more power to decide on its own affairs-if not full autonomy.
Every year, around 20-30 million tourists visit Venice.

I will do well without such attention
The 23-year-old runner has noticed the public figures.
Amalie Iuel has published stunning pictures of herself, including the scenery of the Grand Canyon.
Danish-Norwegian, Amalie Iuel has emerged as a popular athlete in his current homeland of Norway, not least because he broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400 metre race at the time of the March 51.81.
A month later, he healed the Norwegian record of 400 m hurdles at the time of 55.38.
Iuel, who uses diligently social media, soon became aware that fame and publicity had its drawbacks.
Men from all over the world began to send iuellle their sex organs pictures apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close off its Snapchat account.
I got a lot of "smut photos" from strangers, so I had to turn my account into private, Iuel told VG magazine.
In an interview with the VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of images he received.
You can probably guess, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to have feedback after running, but I'll get along well without such a different kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark 1994.
His mother is Danish, the father of Danish-Norwegian.
The family of Iuel moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, the family first moved to Namibia, then to Pakistan, because of the work of the father.
It was followed by Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
He spent four years at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he exchanged Danish citizenship for Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is trained by three trainer, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth slusmin.
In Norway, there is much more openness to discuss than the United States.
In the United States, coaches do not ask for anything but only give orders.
In Norway, the coach has a lot more time to be personally involved with the athlete, Iuel said to the.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records in 400 metres and 400 m hurdles.
Foot injury took snowboarder Janne Korven's whole career to the horizontal board-now included in the World Cup: "Comfortable when not hurt"
Now it's been nice to count when nothing happened!
Janne Korpi, who is one of Finland's most successful snowboarders, has been able to really enjoy his beloved species this season.
Last summer, the continuation of the career was at stake.
The foot strain injury had forced the ears to the cutting table in January, and the foot didn't want to heal.
The hand had also taken the hits on the race slope.
In the summer I didn't know anything I would do, whether or not to continue.
The sponsors were broke and a lot of things open, Korpi says.
But that is what it says that things tend to be organized.
The LEG improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood started to pull into the slope.
The follow-up decision was then easy.
I knew it at the latest when I visited the first one on once on snow.
I was that dammit, yes this one again is so much fun, pulled in another couple of seasons.
Korpi was not able to count properly until September/October, but after a long break, the sheer pain of exercise has been a big deal.
The races in Korpi have toured only a few.
It does not hurt.
Competitions have not been the most important aspect of the board ever.
I'm never a single race.
I think it's frustrating to aim for four years in the races, and then you are in the fever of the week.
I can't think so, Korpi says.
Today he is in the halfpip of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Although the individual races do not hold him on board, he always turns on in a heavy company.
According to Korve, the appreciation of the Olympic Games organised by the International Ski Federation has grown over the past few years, although some of the snowboarders also chose the Norwegian X-games at the same time.
Yes these are important games, visibility is big.
However, in my opinion, valuation always depends on the kind of conditions and the level of the competitions.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in the Finnish 12-spiritual team in the Sierra Nevada.
The team's choirs, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are proudly 14 years younger.
It's nice to keep up with your younger friends.
I remember when I was at the stage that everything was new and was so sick excited about everything.
It brings a new flow to itself, Korpi thinks.
On the slope I still have some way to follow, but otherwise I don't, it's the power of friends!
Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career in the background of his snowboarding career.
The son of the driver Jalegenda Pekka Korven is koukuttunut to the trotting sport: the boarder has his own horse-racing horses for whom he is doing training programs.
When I am all the time on the go, little there is too much to be in the Messa.
But I look at a minimum of trotting results every day and usually something of a departure, Korpi says.
Horse racing and trotting coaching are a potential career plan, according to Korven, when the snowboarding career is completed.
I am not bothered to plan that far, but it is at least a probable alternative.
I feel a bit like I was studying it in this way, along with snowboarding.
I try to keep up with the panic and evolve, the summer drive might be something of a departure.
If it's my future occupation, then it's not then hard to start when you have already finished inside the sport.
There is also the Elilopphet horse-racing cruise with the presenter Jaanjo Linonsen.
The duo has rented a cruise ship which will be in Stockholm at the end of May to the Elilopphet race.
Korpi and Linnanmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has gone well and people have been thrilled.
We are now at a point where there is not going to be bankruptcy at least.
A few months still have time, let's hope to get the ship to full, Korpi says excitedly.
The Attendon Nursing Home project for the Crystal has surprised all
The Attendo Ester is the name of the nursing home for the new, 41-seater elderly.
The building of a rich 1 700-storey organism is expected to be next summer for the Health centre neighbor Health Road.
A common wonder is what a new unit of care is enough for customers, because in the meantime, many private nursing homes are being damaged by the customer.
Anne Flink Attendant, the Ministry of Care Services, commented that there will be more demand in kitee in the future not only for the alternatives but also for enhanced service living.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, the choice of freedom also works better, Flink says.
Attendo bought last year from crystalline private nursing homes in Kanvivikkola and Eerik.
The transaction concerned business, but the property is reportedly a five-year lease.
Flink says that there is no acute need to move functions out of these premises.
More on the subject today later.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the Mcvtie's brand in the Scottish factory
The trade union is seeking the approval of Mcvtie's-Keks manufacturer's directors for a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the Scottish Division of the UK General Trade Union GmbH, the company has not told its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits and other products at the factory have more than 500 employees.
The company Pladis, owning Mcvtie's brand, said he had invested more than £5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives will be "told first" if there are any changes.
In a letter to the mill director, GMB urges the company to "respond to concerns about the lack of funding for the modernization of production lines".
Drew Duffy of the GMB trade union attaches great concern to the fact that the factory leader does not have a clear knowledge of Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked from one generation to the next, and the workforce has focused heavily on the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area. The plant is a major employer of high unemployment and a weak livelihood in the region.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as Brexit, rising cost of living and the continued reduction of production, the east of Glasgow needs a thriving Mcvtie's production desperately. "
According to the spokesperson, the director had only received the letter of the trade union the previous day, and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates the continuing interaction with the representatives of the workers and trade union.
"We had a regular meeting with representatives of the workers and the GmbH in Tollcros two months ago, when we debated a number of issues openly.
We discussed with the workers, among other things, that, like other companies in a highly competitive and uncertain market, we are constantly evaluating all our businesses and operations to keep our competitiveness. "
According to the spokesperson, the company has invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross factory in recent years, especially in its production lines and improvement of its operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a production plant and will certainly be the first to tell workers and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the operation of the plant."

Paris Saint-Germain will not give up the quest for Neymar after paying the transfer amount of GBP 189 million to terminate the contract. But did PSG Barcelona warn of a record transfer three years ago?
A sensational move is the most widely spoken case of summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record for the transfer amounts. The previous record was less than half: It was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a GBP 89 million transfer amount.
After the transfer, Neymars becomes the world's most expensive football player and also the world's best-employed professional athlete, as PSG offers him over 500 000 pounds in salary after tax.
Barcelona is known to be outraged at the operation of PSG and the way Neymar has gone from the company. The source near Barcelona tells us that the club has been very well cared for by Nemarn since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of the PSG warn the football world of this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City said he was interested in Blaise Matiid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned clubs seeking the best players from PSG.

"We respect all clubs.
But if they are seeking our players, they will face the consequences. "
