Omar wanted to fix his sex , he became a mental illness and now he is doing artists on this subject - " People should have their own body rights "
Hanging patient report from the roof of the academy of the Fine Arts Academy
Everyone wrote Kimmil's name.
The paper is telling the story of how many years the exterior has explained to Auer and his identity.
He decides for who he is.
" I wanted to share my personal history so that the violence in the process would be visible ", says Aure.
By process , he refers to the process of gender reconstruction.
This is often a period of research that includes meetings with psychologists , psychologists , carers and doctors.
The process of " gender identity diagnosis " takes place in Tampere and Helsinki is processed with a referral
Auer for , the process started four years ago.
Even before , he used estrogen he ordered on the Internet and his own repair process was still very long.
He felt that he was a woman , but according to the Finnish law , a person should face the process of correction , so that the gender can be amended legally.
Trans Act , transasiyala sex (563200 ii ) establishment was forced to amend the law which gender , gender was forced to modify , for example , Population Register Center and the passport.
For the time being , each penis corrector requires the proof of psychological diagnosis and reproduction disability.
People have the right to decide their own body.
" This situation is intolerable and violates human rights ," says Air.
Translavania is known in Finland for a long time.
The United Nations Human Rights Council has provided eight observations of the law and is a primary rule of the European Court of Human Rights, which respected the parties in the European Convention on Human Rights in respect to sovereignty.
The former government of Finland then made a law amendment with the then Social Affairs and Health Minister Susin Huvinen.
Election came and the true Finns government rose .
Now the law amendment is again stuck.
This is the subject of an internal political dispute that is not related to this law.
Frank Johnson , the Executive Director of the Amnesty Department of Finland , explains , " The government does not want to increase the government on the table because there is a difference between the government about changing the law. "
There are two main structures in front of the showroom.
One of them is packaging and instructions for using medicines used by Auer .
Patient Report During the installation , a visitor can read , for example , explaining transplant psychologists from the air , University Hospital of Tampe University Hospital
Psychologist met with Kamil's array twice and wrote a report on this basis , which should be defined as Auer 's right and a treatment for help
The fable reality of reality appears to be vulnerable to shame.
Self - perception self - perception is manifested in a fragmentary, fragmentary system , and the unstable characteristics associated with the personality are emphasized.
Air has not identified itself in these descriptions.
" It's a panic to hear me diagnosed as a mental illness ," says Auer .
There was also a great shock when Auer was not given sex treatment.
According to the nursing staff , he did not have enough resources to make the process of starting the process.
He was banned from his own identity.
Then , two 011 On 11 February , the air came out of the meeting room and the television waiting for the unexpected cut.
Later , on television , an industry named Monument was born , where Aau reflects his experience about his power and its use.
" It is crazy that anyone who is born between any woman can increase her breasts , but her breasts need to be diagnosed for removal ," Auer said.
If you think that your body is not your body other than the number of your births determined by birth.
Unfortunately , Auer 's experience is not the only one.
Sexual exclusion is much more difficult for mental reasons than pure medical treatment.
It's going to meet dozens of people who have justified their own excuses and right to their own sexual experiences.
" It is crazy that people who need support and assistance have denied treatment , they argue that their resources are insufficient ," Air said.
Many people in the process have mental symptoms behind them : depression , anxiety , potential vomiting.
To this end , nursing staff can rule out that treatment can not be started.
" It can destroy an even worse situation before the onset of treatment and help ," Auer said.
Oure's own exhibition also works with thoughts and thoughts of suicide.
In the text of the exhibition , Ayre wrote : " I have self - destructive thoughts in my adult life and it is something that can digest humans. "
When depression was treated with medicines and when Auer started using hormones , the feeling was relieved .
She has finally been able to say the feeling that childhood and teen years were already existent.
Why the broad jaw does not feel fit in the body and why the chest muscles should be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer is that people around him can see him.
Seeing is a basic requirement.
"It's a matter of talking , dressing , using voice and debating it ," she said.
Nowadays , Auer had already shown that he is , she is a woman
In the initial phase of processing , casual comments of close relatives can be a big loss
It is most damaged when close relatives help.
" They should and they know who I am , but they do not agree or can not implicit it ," he said.
However , all transfers do not require physical changes.
They may cause anxiety and even physical pain in the body or part where the formula or physical mood does not survive.
Apart from the use of hormones and long-term research programs , there is no official confirmation of their sexuality.
" There is no medical reason for this research ", Aure said.
And it's true.
For example , in Denmark , June 014 , Parliament is a new method for legal recognition of sex.
The new law is based on self-determination of legal sex.
A full - time applicant submits a written application for a new personal ID , indicating that he is facing other sexes.
After the half-year cooling - off period, the applicant will be able to confirm their application in writing and the ministry will provide the applicant with a new ID number.
This sovereignty is also needed in Finland , and this requirement is summarized by the exhibition of the world.
It is not a therapeutic experience for the artist , but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection.
I want to believe that industry prices continue and when politicians forget human rights then they can make political changes at that time.
Camille Auer 's exhibition Antiphallic Dick 4th-28th July , in the 2017 Fine Arts Academy Project Room.
Civil Rights Organization issued a travel warning in Missouri
African - National NAACP organization for American citizenship has issued a travel warning about Missouri. Because of the state's discriminatory behavior and racist attacks happened there. 
" Missouri for the NAACP ' s travel announcement of 8 June , the 017 on effect and African - American tourists , visitors and locals special attention and a state where there are many controversial racial incidents in the travel caution when called for. Recently, " Press release states.
Recently, law enforcement agencies in Missouri have been fraudulent for the trial of anti-discrimination lawsuits. In addition , the use of land law is unclear for compulsory minorities. According to NAAC , these factors led to a travel alert.  
" People's rights have been violated.
They are closed on the basis of skin color and killed or beaten , "said NAACP Missouri chairman Rudd Chapel Kansas City Star.
" We have never heard many things at the same time. "
The organization's first warning example for the United States is Missouri's travel statement.
For example, the organization , for example , University of Missouri African - American students in Tennessee Racist remarks, and two 8 -year - old black man, referring to the death of Troy Sanders said.
Sanders died in suspicious situations earlier this year. When he ran out of his car fuel then he was driving across the state. Missouri police arrested him , though he was not charged with the crime.  
Travel notes noted by the Missouri Justice Minister that the police-black-haired drivers are probably perhaps close to 75 percent white
"The purpose of the travel bulletin is to alert people and be alert to their family , friends , and colleagues who can happen in Missouri ," Chapel said.
" People have to prepare , for example , to pay for guarantees or to tell relatives that they want to travel through the state. "
According to the FBI , Missouri , the 011 in the hundred prisoners had been recorded , 16 th in the United States in the United States.
A travel alert also makes a response to the new law of Missouri , which makes it difficult for the company to challenge the right to housing and work relationship.
ACLU , a civil rights guardian of the Constitution , recently issued a immigration alert after receiving immigration laws in Texas and Arizona that the police objected to arresting people from an immigration attack. According to the organization , this raises racial profiling. 
In general , travel alerts express concern about the foreign ministry and other states. Recently , however , NGOs responded to their United States specific laws and trends. 
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report of supplementary pension for CEOs
Mika lintila ( center ), the state is responsible for the ownership stiyarinyera , airline managing the supplementary pension provided by peska bharamo phinayarake asked to explain about grants , Yale said.
According to the minister , it is contrary to the will of the state.
This week when the Voramo 130,000 euro supplementary pension was raised Helsingin Sanomat reported the development of the company's fees for the fee
Suvain Kuvalatti about VAVA supplemental pension in February
Finnair reported that he would leave his supplementary pension 2013 .
The government has decided that no supplementary pension will be used for the prize.
Owns more than half of the state's Finnair
According to the company , the decision was consistent with the decision of owners' policy guidelines last year.
The ban immediately prompted the speeches
Even a few days ago, it seemed that the relationship between the United States and Russia was in the way of heating from cold.
President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin , who took part in the G- 20 summit in Hamburg's industrialized country , started working well together.
Since then , the atmosphere has been quite cool.
Last week the new economic sanctions signed by the United States Congress and on Wednesday night were signed by Trump in Russia.
Most of the reactions have been heard by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev so far , which means that the latest compulsory holidays package means " full trade war " .
Even if the Russian reaction is only solved by political embellishments and tensions , the US - the intensity of Russian relations is a fact after a short honeymoon after the election of trams.
The success of the campaign for Russia , Iran and North Korea in the US was not easy.
The Congress , however , passed the law with a tremendous consensus , but it was very difficult for the President to accept the law.
In the tram recently, he criticized the law signed for " a big accident " .
Perhaps the reason for Trump's pride was Russia , although it was abusive to adopt a law to limit his power.
Well known , there is also an investigation with the Russian connection to the Tramp Drive about Russia's possible possible involvement in the United States.
US - The intensity of Russian relations is a fact after a little honeymoon.
As the White House staff has changed dramatically , and nearly most of the obsolete twists have been updated almost , it is increasingly clear that the United States will not be under the President's policy , but despite the president.
Such a situation is beneficial in any way.
If Russian relations are in the United States , the same goes for the European Union.
In addition to the economic sanctions , the Baltic Sea, the security situation in the central region of the Union will be intensified.
His relationship with the EU Russian has raised the situation in Ukraine and is called for the implementation of Minsk's contract.
Although United Russia has at least maintained its policy so far , the interests of the member state are quite different.
Finland , Finland, like many members of the business of business , economic sanctions were a real violation.
The recent mandate of the United States is not yet clear.
The EU fears that the ban on the activities of many European companies will be hampered.
In Finland , the effects may be perceived , for example , in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and perhaps in the Phinnomas nuclear power plant project.
The good wishes of Europe happened because , for example , an important liquid for the US economy came out of the natural gas embargo.
Trade - Offs are a medium of world politics for the disclosure of untrue.
Economic sanctions must of course be very thoughtful and correct.
Otherwise they are more of a difficulty than the benefits.
Is there nothing sacred ?
Following the White House Statue of Liberty of the tram now
Sculpture is the perfect sign of lost infection.
Along with Americans, it is also known to others : Iraqis shot Saddam Hussein's statue in 2003 with Ferdous Square with American soldiers .
Stephen Miller , one of the main ideology of the tram administration , is well aware of what he is doing in an intense debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty faces Miller's attack on God's Word about the President's proposal to reduce global immigration. 
Miller did not really criticize the statue itself.
If he did that , he was imprisoned in the vast exterior of cruise ships and statues, imitating the Studio of Liberty.
The image of his attack was important, and especially in 1903 , the statue of Emma Lazar was added to the statue - 17 years after the full form of the statue .
Miller has decided on Oxo : " I do not want to give more details in history , but the statue of liberty ... is the symbol of American independence for the whole world.
Poetry is later added , and it is not included in the original statue Liberty. " 
Miller himself was not wrong , but not the history , he himself said.
What are the sensitive words of Lazarus , the state calls not only the immigrant , but "the poorest of the poor ": " You are tired , your poor ," " unwanted rejection of your timing shore. "
Rano is now more temporal than before.
Militarium literature does not have the importance of criticism. He made it clear that the " poorest poorer " trump does not welcome in the United States. 
The debate about the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a comprehensive political and cultural debate about the importance of the United States.
After the death of Lazarus, his friends were circulated to write poetry with his statue. They knew well that this law was firmly political. 
The purpose of the statue was with the classic symbolizing of the connections between the French and the American Republic , feminine organs of independence.
The meaning of Lazarus has changed : In her poetry the female character is not abstract , but there is a voice.
And it gives itself a new name : Deportation mother
There was an aesthetic feminist coup to attach poetry to the film and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
The meaning of the statue of Lajja has changed , and for a long time it was necessary to return from the original.
Limbo rubber - a cursor, which can be considered as a sign of the tram - the 010 in the Statue of Liberty was claimed that the do not call anyone , but nekonsarbhabhetarera first pioneers , the United States will bring darkness in the dark : " Lady Liberty comes out
He took liberty to disorder the United States from all over the world.
The torch is not showing the way in the United States. " 
Rarely definitely , definitely , limboba was partly right.
The importance of the constitution depends entirely on the aspect.
After a long and long journey, Lazarus saw this famine and tired but looked optimistic migrants from the ship's deck.
He saw the perspective of seeking his protection and a better life.
She encouraged her with freedom and encouraged her.
And Miller and Trump want any way.
Do not show their racing ways , but the fate of hatred , power is their only source.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black praised Scotland's British National Team member
Illydra Doyle remembers the time when the UK National Team only had two scooters
Chief Executive Officer of the British Athletics Association said that the blue blocks , World Championships, participating national teams, 16 other members of the party " a major encouragement " .
At the London Athletics World Championship, a record number of Scottish Athletes was selected on Friday.
Black has said that British athletes need to learn about " special things " about Scotland .
" It is welcome and we will continue to study it as much as we understand ," Black said.
" I spoke to the representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute , and they thought it was the organization's activity.
The Scottish Athletics Association believes that it is part of the alliance program ,
And the British Athletics Association believes that it is under their control.
And the common man thinks there is something to do with his affair.
However , it does have something very amazing about what to do. " 
Many scooters in London compete with Sir M Farah in London with a 5000 meter run finish, including the Laura Muir and Andrew Buchmer with serious medals . Allyd Doyle , instead , was elected the national team captain. 
" Eliad is silently submissive.
His captain's remarks were incredibly spectacular , " Black said.
" Athletes abandon the phenomenon with pride in their achievements and undoubtedly where they live and practice.
In the words of Eliudh , there was real feelings and emotions for sports. " 
Eliidha Doyle won a silver medal in the 400m by the Commonwealth Championships , and is his fifth World Cup. According to him , it is " incredible " that the national team has 16 Scottish 
The previous record was seven years from 1983 and 2015 .
Midway runner Laura Muir has five Great Britain and two European records
He is competing in 1500 meters and 5000 meters London.
Chris and , at the 1,500 -meter run in London. It is also worth watching : Man has won a qualifying season as well as winning the qualifiers and anniversary games of the UK World Cup. 
Dowel reminds his first world championship , when the national team's only team Lee McConnell
Said the captain , he took several skotasa " extremely proud " of them serious about a few finals and medal.
" Captain's access is a great honor , but more specific because of the national captain's captain's captain's vote ," Dowell says.
" I'm definitely proud of all the skoteista , who reached the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are part of meritorious athletes who compete for the prize.
Captain's statement ?
I think it went well.
I was focusing on how lucky we are when I have homework
Enjoy the support of the home crowd and we come back to the Olympic Stadium
I got another chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere will be amazing. " 
Blocking Bloggers on Facebook : If You Can not Stand For Criticism Do not Qualify For A Public Post
We knew how our father preached bad.
Americans love George Washington , but the magazines soon begin criticizing their potential domestic politics , always with their political policies.
Christchurch is certainly annoyed ,
But he is not silent to his critics.
In 1783 , Washington said , " If freedom of speech disappears , we will be drunk and calm like a sheep. "
We have to learn from Maryland Governor Larry Hogan from Washington.
Hagan's employee removed nearly 450 comments on his official Facebook page and banned their activities.
US Civil Rights Alliance challenges Hagan's law this weekend
His staff is not justified by the challenge , and the attitude was even frustrating on the Web.
" Who cares ? It's just Facebook ," many commented.
But it matters ,
Especially in the case of Hogan
Hogan is a wonderful popular Republican governor of a Democrat's state.
He got the second place in the top 50 in the governors .
Hogan is not a response to hot shit.
He led the state permanently and firmly followed the policy.
He has skillfully used his voters as the main communication channel on Facebook and published the photo facing him in chemotherapy.
So it is unnecessary and even dangerous to prevent users from coming to the governor's Facebook page. The governor's page is a public and government forum that is with its employee tax revenues. 
Hogan spokesman Amelia Chassy, ​​in response to the Governor's reaction to the Washington Post , said that it was only moderate to comment. 
Marking the commenter as trunks , spammers or disgusting , however , is a simple solution.
The Washington Post gives interviews to hijacked users on Facebook by Hogan.
They turned ordinary people who wanted to talk to their leaders. They were not traitors , but teachers , entrepreneurs and pastors, for example. 
They report that their comments are honorable , thoughtful and relevant.
His commentary in the West is quoted in the Bible ; He wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith. 
Lawyer Laxmi Sharma Romney Maryland was not hostile but raises a question about hate crime.
" I humbly commented that I was disappointed that he could not stand up against frequent crimes and other recent news ," he wrote a news report on the Washington Post.
"Nor can I accept that when more people comment on the same thing, they are considered to be somehow organized into a mass and ignored as a large group of worried citizens."
The governor's staff say comments as a " centralized attack " . Some people can promote important things which are important 
In the era of Facebook , communication by blocking a critic or deleting a critical comment is facilitated.
The protesters used to collect and burn newspapers to arrest and silence.
This is true , however , about the same thing , now just as digital
Hogan is not the first government official responsible for Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked the President Truman and challenged the court.
The first important decision was made in Virginia last week
Judge James C in Alcandari District Court According to kyacarisera , Facebook laudauna county government to prevent voters in violation of the US Constitution's First Addition.
And met with the US citizens' rights organization Twitter and Facebook using Kentucky governor Matt Bevan.
It does not have to be difficult.
During Washington , low cost postal costs have a similar effect on today's Internet.
The number of newspapers has been the fourth from 1776 to 1800 , and anonymous writers took oath to Washington.
Already there was a pedestrian at that time.
The pseudonym Jurikola , Valerius , Belliserius and Portius magazine wrote the magazine that they spread on Washington's decision.
President's Office Jay 's Treaty , United States - came to the petition criticizing British cooperation , trade and maritime agreements. It is clear from documents collected by George Washington Network project documents. 
However , he is not silent critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of discussion are the foundation of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
To stop eating the summer's summer, it should be stopped immediately
Samples have been received in almost 40 places , as well as two , three online notifications
Most of them came from South and South Finland , but still from Hongphey and Sanyozoki senior scientist Marja Ismursu Evija said
Green peals have died in trichomonos parasite.
It is a primitive animal known as Trichomonas gallina.
It is known to first kill the pigeons , and especially to the puddle .
However , in the 21st century , this disease was also detected by peach birds.
The 009 In , the right thing was right.
Then the triciscin resulted in a major fall of the Finnish cottage pepper population , which resulted in the revival of the stock of the species.
Jawha Manakal , director of the Museum of Natural History of the Museum of Natural History ( Luomas ) , said there are ill- fabled green peas , but there is no big scale yet.
That's great , do not put anything past the green chili will be renewed epidemic.
What you need to do now is a very simple thing that everyone can do : stop bird's summer meal immediately
More about this later.

Indonesia's golden country poverty and death
Birda Degie does not use street stuets.
He uses boils but rarely.
In the Papaya province of Indonesia, there is a wooden building in Anatarty, the capital of the Pania area. When he prepares for dinner, he usually places a sweet potato - locally " note " - directly in the fireplace. 
After half an hour, the cigarette weevil got hungry in the fire.

The toilet employed a bucket at an uninterrupted room.
Deghi is the youngest of her fourest men and has not been appointed to treat her.
Multivision is common here.
Poor work can be hazardous : most of the people in the village are unemployed , and much more. In addition , the soldiers must be considered. 
" Someone is afraid to walk in the village after five in the evening ," said Digi.
It is Papua Highlands , East Dutch colony , which was incorporated in Indonesia in 1969 . This was a controversial referendum organized , where 1 026 people were forced to vote before the public voted.
The local independence movement , opposing Dutch power , expresses anger over the Jakarta government , which makes the area under strict control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from accessing it.
2003 In , the province was officially divided into Papua and West papuyate. Papua New Guinea belongs to the eastern part of the island. 
Enarotali is remote and screaming. The journey started from the provincial capital, Jaypura to Nabir, for one - half hour flight , and a car parked on a pond carrying a five-hour drive. 
There is no public transport here.
Almost 19,000 people rocks rust and rust rug with rugged wooden houses , surrounded by bamboo town .

" Before we had the only leaf as a cover on our body. "
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia. 28% of residents live below the poverty line , and children's death rates and illiteracy are the highest in Asia. 
But it's gold in Indonesia
Nearly 153,000 residents of the New Jersey Hill Region are about to drink . Grasberg , about a hundred kilometers from Pania , is the world's largest and most profitable gold mine. It is owned by Phoenix McMurron, founded by Phoenix.

In addition , Papua has an estimated $ 78 billion wood conservation
But for the people of Papy , bring these riches to misery , as they represent the suppressive presence of the powerful army of Indonesian .
The New York Times was published in 005 that between 1998 and 2004 , the freewat provided approximately $ 20 million to the local military and military units . $ 150,000 was paid to private officials 
The source of the threat to the sovereignty claims of Papua definitely , definitely, and that is silent
According to human rights activists, since 1969 , the Indonesian army killed more than 500,000 people and raped , tortured and thousands of detainees.

Mr. Markku Saviko, managing director of APV Investigations said that the admission rate is approximately 70 percent.
Most employees of most banks have invested in APV 1 or APV 2 , because their company mandates their execution as per their own rules.
Then without mentioning the names of the younger brokers whose staff will be influenced by graduate degrees , Savikko says.
According to him , this type of brokerage firm " a few " .

As an investment product dealer , you can work on the policy , even if your skills and competencies are in low level
From this point , the situation is wild and free.
Many industries require more robust skills , says Saviko.
According to sabhiki , early next year , this will be reinforced by the new miuphida second.
It needs to be responsible for the ability of employees to provide investment services to each company to be efficient enough.
On the other hand, financial misuse has to be done , which has the power to implement it.

According to Hove , the new requirements are applicable to tied-up agents by the investment companies own employees and on behalf of a company.
Habee said that according to the government's proposal by the Ministry of Finance , Fija has the capability to impose qualifications and experience.
They are right , this decision will take place in the upcoming autumn.
In the future , the company needs to provide necessary training and where appropriate , follow - up and further training will be provided.
All this must be done in the document , and the company has also seen that this obligation has also been there.
Hovi explains that in the case of practice , for example , the description of the work of a separate employee of the company is listed.
Depending on the investment advice or the sale of the products, there will definitely be different levels of demand.
According to Hov , knowledge is not sufficiently level at the experience or experience, if the new is also needed time with an experienced experienced person.
That is , a company does not meet all the criteria for a new employee hires you , the employee will have to work with a fixed timer.
According to Hov , change rules will be drawn and become more concrete.
The law will be tightened on the sale of investment products at the beginning of 2018

New results of the Swedish test are published for the asylum seekers
The best medical examination results for shelter candidates have been published in Sweden. The results of the test concluded with the new evaluation method that 80% of the tested testers are over 18 years of age. However , not everyone considers tests to be reliable.  
The Swedish National Forensic Office started the test earlier this year.
Tests can be used to accurately assess the age of refugees. The Swedish immigration service is offered a new test for failing to determine the real age of applicants for minors claiming. 
The Finnish Immigration Service has conducted 6,880 tests so far , and the Forensic Medicine Office has announced 2,481 tests. The exam is held mid- March and mid- July 2017 .

"The statistics are quite consistent. There is no noticeable difference between the previous months' statistics ," he mentioned the local newspaper.
Although most applicants 18 years of age are available , but it does not mean that , applicants lied about their age.
In May, the organization declared 581 results and reported that 44 cases should be marked "18 years of age or older " .
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same result , it turned out that in 243 cases , the applicant had openly said that he would meet this year for 18 years.

One of the suspects is Endocrinologist of the Karolinska Institute , Claude Marcus , whose work determines human biological maturity. This assessment can be used to determine whether a puberty has happened before or after it. 
" I did not think there was any reason for this and I think the procedure is not right to use.
In this way biological age is very uncertain.
If we can not determine the age , we can not pretend we can do it , " he told the Metro newspaper.
However , geranasana responsible for the accuracy of testing for forensic Affairs : " Generally speaking , adults determine the risk for small children.
The most risk of condition is where the tester will soon be 18 years old. Then the risk is about 10 percent. "

How Neymar's transfer of influence in Paris affects the financial rules of football
Preventing the use of European football clubs Barcelona does not bar the transfer of Paris Saint-Germain from Neymar to France. This is the most expensive football transfer ever. 
The possible fine for Paris Saint-Germain ( PSG ) has decided to rule UEFA in European football , which will not participate in the competitive Champions League.
The 011 In , iuiephae a fair economic rules of the game has launched. According to them , PSG must be able to prove that , large losses have been funded by the transfer of Neymar. 
Barcelona's Brazilian contract was given 222 million euros to end and Neymar's annual salary in the new year was millions of dollars.
Neymar is involved in expanding an economic direction in France.
PSG has no problem in paying Neymar's transfer money and linking him to his artisan , because it is operated by a Qatari oil - rich ruler figure.
The clubs can buy huge amounts of players , but they must be in line with the actual revenue source so that the soccer - related business does not suffer.
The 007 in the iuiephae for the French Presidency of the draft rules of the game are fair organized by Michael platinera.
Former footballer Platini thinks that the backdrop of success with the loan was shocked behind and the bank or the owners withdrew their support.
The 011 In , their financial losses in order to monitor the club's debt has been the focus of the financial fair play rules.
Changes mean that in 2003 Chelsea became more difficult to implement Roman Abramovich 's first business model. Abramovich bought a promising team , spent huge amounts on the player's purchase and made a global brand. 
The current three-year assessment for fair game rules will last until 2018 . During this time , the loss of the club will make a maximum of € 30 million maximum.
However, Platini II 015 in iuiephae skaile wanted to go beyond the Chairman , the oldest of his successor Alexander sepharina want to control the use of cast-iron.
" Rules of the game is still used, and we must continue to apply them in the future ," Andrea Traverso, the UEFA in the Fair is responsible for the rules of the game , the Associated Press said last week.
Although Pep Guardioli gave Neymar a one-acre payment outside his contract , he could determine the amount of his note for his new contract term.
Neymar has completed five years of contract , so the amount of transfer for the next five years can be recorded as an annual expenditure of $ 44.4 million.
The first ban is rewarded on the basis of the fair game rules in 2014 . Most restrictions are issued on PSG and Manchester City , which is operated by Abu Dhabi.
PSG Euro fined 60 million , which was later reduced by 20 million euros . In addition , the 5 players instead of the 2014-2015 season's Champions League group, 21 players were ordered to restrict. 
Through the club-owned companies, UEFA can increase their income by monitoring clubs and protesting against its financial constraints.
For example , if the Qatar-based company supports PSG, the support price is considered on the general level of the market , but UEFA will not count the grants as the actual revenue.
This happened when UEFA decided in 2014 that the PSG was oversized to support the Qatar Tourism Authority .
It has become clear that , piesajite Neymar is part of the Qatar II 0 X World Cup organizing committee can finance fee.
However , the PSG and the organizational committee denied that Neymar would serve as ambassador for the World Championship. The UEFA would be very easy to publish such a system. 
Due to previous sanctions of PSG , following the UEFA rules , the company will follow closely more closely than usual.
There is no scope for negotiation with UEFA PSG for the transfer of Neymar.
Sources gave an interview with the Associated Press Agency that their identity was not disclosed on condition because they have no authority to discuss the position of PSG .
According to the most recent financial statements , PSG 's total sales of the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was 10 million euros.
The financial statement of last year has not yet been announced.
PSG returns to attract new sponsors for the arrival of Neymar and to increase sales of tracking products and gambling products.
According to the company's estimate, its total sales will increase by 30 percent with NAM agreement .
The Spanish League , which was evidently excited by the best players in the world , tried to make Neymar more difficult to move further. It has broken the rules of the game. 
" It is a clear economic doping case for both club and state ," said Spanish President Javier Tebas Spanish newspaper AS. By state he mentions PSG's ownership of Qatar. 
Arsenal manager aresena oyengarao are aware of that , state programs funded by the football club. Arsenal is owned by an American sports boom. 
" The change in football environment for the last 15 years has happened because of the ownership ," Winger said on Thursday.
" Everything is possible after the football team becomes the owner of the state, everything is possible.
The game is very difficult to comply with the rules. There are many types of interests that involve famous players representing the states. "

World medal for Finland requires a miracle
The World Athletics Championship will begin this Friday in London and ends on Sunday , a free week on the 13th of August.
Athletics , cross-country, and the Finnish Ice Hockey is the sport of the athletic enthusiast athletes over the years could be a year , they succeeded not whether.
In the heart of athletes athletes , success is measured in medal.
Sure there are other meters.
Less attention is given to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one dimension to another, where by gaining experience, mature athlete's performance to the level that the MM medal of adults is genuinely possible.
Now there is no young athlete in Finland at the small world championship and they do not even qualify.
World medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately , sport attraction and wonder that the wonders may also happen.
It sports out to the athlete's television screen and shines to follow the races , even the London medals will only be overcome due to differences in the afternoon.
In the previous World Championship 2015 athletics , Finland has won a bronze medal.
It was operated by Spotlock's Tero Peatkomkki
Elephants are still waiting for Peethmick to win a medal , while others reveal the results of their past and other riders, as well as Peter Mammick's absence in qualifying last summer.
However , in this competition , Pitkämäki remains a great Finnish hero in history.
Closing the race for other Finnish athletes or making your own record is a good performance.
Confidence and the belief in the final medal of Finnish athletics in the coming years will be a great success for this year's young international award.
Young talent and financial support of his work are more important than maintaining a small elite of athletic athletes.
Success does not come at the moment , but requires the patience of the athletic athletes as well as the need for training and training from the athletes.
Finns can appreciate the international sports great and enjoy their unique success.
Hopefully, in the history of the London Games, the likes of Usain Bolt and M Farah will not be as rowdy , due to terrorism or cowardly attacks.

Small Circle Nostalgia : Hot American Samar and Comrade Detectives
The story of 80 's and 90 's grunja character ( David Owen and Michael soletara MTV creates a legacy for the series ) and their time - the 001, Elizabeth Banks , Amy first , Paul Rudd, and the series is one of the biggest stories in their career move
As a cultural product , it is a parody of both and a continuation of memories that we are stuck in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product , it feels like it already lives.
The first day of the camp was surprisingly amazingly working , not just because of his strange humor ( among other things it said H Beginnin as a backdrop of a vegetable vessel.
The origin of jokes is that , middle-aged actors work as a breakthrough young man of most age groups. It is possible to reach out in the past by emphasizing some joke impossible. 
Less than ten years later , where adults work as adults , less emotional and parody divides further : For example , the 90 's stark print parodies , such as The Door Film Hand for Each Crad to Swing
Apple paoyarabuka one point one of the characters , inline skate and "1991, from the other elements of the " dig.
Many stories are the same as in the past
Good - impressive koopa ( Michael saolara ), now a writer, but still Katia ( margarita Mora ) to reach.
Victor ( Why Marino ) is still a virgin.
And a crazy story , Ronald Reagan ( also Michael Showalter) George H . W. Bush ( Michael Ian Black played ) with.
As always, such as series , the best side style is.
Particularly fun is Paul Rudd , who is under a couple from his lower-necked Dildo or Matt Dillon's " soul patch " movie unit. Rudy's acting , King of Shibir , Andy , begins to be an old man. 
Sometimes a crazy moment can stop this series to pick up a series of up a series ! Until its obvious decision : wet summer American Summer - twenty years later. In his final scene , the band of friends went to the premiere of Vat Hot American Summer.  
On the other hand , Comrade Detective series in Azemas relies on a different dissent : America's cold war spirit , autonomic blonde film, and even Geolo Series of Button that fills East West.
The comedy series is directed by Ryan Thomas , created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka . This 1 9 80 during the Romanian Police made the pole , where the bourgeois couple is true , nastikabada and Marxism - Leninism fights. 
Gregarina performers , and Florin Piersic juniors and Corneliu Ulici in , Iosefina idealistic as their lines in English Channing tatuma ( The main producer ) and Joseph Gordon - Levitt has been doubled by. 
This is a great idea ,
But not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (as the United States looks at football, as well as the police are spending time watching television in chess ) .
There are famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate , Nick Baxman , Maharsal Ali, and Clo Sevini. Their banging gets a pretty fun game. 
However, Comrade Detective , a strange socialist drama too is associated with the iteration - for example , Reagan is a despicable killer behind the mask. Therefore , the series is really beginning to feel like a peculiar publicity. 
Six tall long long and the series laughs fast enough or not enough.
In short , the series could work well with agitprop satires , for example , when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visited the US embassy , and there are always two fat people in the lobby with hamburger.
The message to the imaginary communist people is that Western culture can create all types of consumer goods and fast food.
Imaginary Romanian creators of the series were not wrong : we have our own history and their history like a tortoise

Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25 percent
The Bank of England is hoping that its rate will remain unchanged when the economic growth will be ineffective and the rate of inflation will be stopped by estimating the rate of interest increase.
Bank of India warned that economic growth will slow down. The bank increased the interest rate is definitely , definitely, because of growing pressure on household income level. 
The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee interest rate decision by manufacturers to 0.25 percent 6-2 decided to. This month , interest rates were less favorable , because economic growth has been ineffective. 
In its quarterly survey of inflation , the bank 2017 from the 1.7% forecast of the forecast and its 2018 forecast of 1.6%, it warned that , the income levels are increasing , because the harvest of inflation is expected to reach around three percent. 
According to the bank , however , there is a need to increase interest rates in the coming years to reduce the raised inflation of the brand. In addition , the bank announced that the cost of borrowing would be higher than expected in the financial market. 
In addition , the committee member Brexit decided to withdraw the part of the huge financial package that began the results of the referendum a year ago.
The bank will end the term financing scheme in February of 018 , although it now expects to provide more than 15 million pounds more than £ 115 million in funding through the program.
The bank's interest rate protocols think : "According to the Monetary Policy Commission , the GDP will continue to slow down in the next few years , because the cost of reducing the actual income of the family will reduce costs. "
Regarding the rate of interest , the bank has reiterated that it is necessary to reduce the monetary policy to a slightly widespread " monetary policy to be tightened " .
The Market 2018 in the third quarter and II 0 II 0 in the second place, it has forecast.
However , the banks stressed that the possible increase is " gradually " and " limited " .
In May , the bank predicted an increase of 1.9 percent this year and an increase of 1.7 percent for the next year .
It is now forecasting 2018 forecast for 1.8 percent .
Due to the news, the decline in dollars and euros has decreased.
Compared to the dollar , the pound was reduced by 0.5 percent and was $ 1.31 . With the euro it was weaker by 0.4 percent and EUR 1.11 . 
The decrease in interest rates is expected to keep the interest rate unchanged after the expected lower than expected lower growth rates. GDP increased 0.3 percent in the second quarter and 0.2 percent in the first quarter . 
Bank expects third-quarter growth rate of 0.3% increase , but at the end of the year to take up a little bit.
His latest inflation review is not frequent expectation from families suffering from inflation and serious wage increases. According to the bank , the situation is getting worse before it gets better. 
The bank further added that in the next few years the monetary policy can not prevent " fiscal collapse " . However , it expects that the wage increase will end in the " significantly " three-year forecasts 
The weak pound will make the economy stronger by the risk of the demand for British goods. This eliminates the reduction of personal expenses. 
This decision was taken within a year after the eurozone referendum was reduced by 0.25 percent after the pound hit .
The bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision will probably start at the price and in the economy four years later.
Before the latest decision by the Central Bank , interest rate hikes began to say more and more when the inflation hit the house. Three decision-makers increased by 0.5 percent in July . 
Inflation declined 2.6% to 2.9% in June last month . But according to the bank , it was expected , and in the coming months, inflation will again be strong. 
According to the bank , the two percent target is due to " full " low pounds.
Corero told the mortgage broker's director Andrew Montlell , " It seems to be working harder in the Mortgage market competition due to the swap rate hikes in recent times , lenders are looking for customers dangerously and want to end the year . "
" It seems particularly good for them to conclude the current debt contract of the market, re-agreement is more popular , they have lower interest rates and there are unreliable options. "
NHS 10,000 controversial HIV drugs set
Since September , patients may be defined as a " preventive " HIV - blocking drug. The Supreme Court decides a debate over the funding of UK Public Health Care Systems ( NHS ) medicines. 
The NHS said that pre - exposure treatment ( pre - propose ) treatment for about 10,000 people was done in the first three-year examination . Prior to infection , drugs were found to reduce the risk of infection of about 86% in high risk . 
After Supreme Court's verdict in the Supreme Court last year's rule, the NHS agreed to form a fund for this trial. Accordingly , NHS is able to pay for prize , although it claims that local authorities should finance it. 
UK NHS director Simon Stevens announced on Thursday that " a new intervention " and described as " important moment " of the National AIDS Agency .
London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and Sheffield's sexual health clinic began to get registered in a study expanding to other clinics in October. The test will reach its full scale in England in April 2018 . 
Pre - Exposure Treatment ( Pre - P ) is an HIV positive drug that reduces the risk of infection before an infection.
Studies have shown that PREP significantly reduces the risk of reducing HIV transmission risk in risk groups .
Before a medication , it means there is enough medication in the body during the transit time to prevent HIV infection.
Medication can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The goal group includes homosexual men , bisexual men and transgender people , and HIV-positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
Clinical men , women and transgendered people are the test candidates choice , and those HIV positive partners do not know to have antiretroviral therapies for their illness
People living in England and general practitioners can register for a test at the local sexual health clinic.
This program is 10 million pounds, and carries the NHS in England this week after an international bidding process to follow signed a contract for the drugs.
The purpose of the test is to evaluate the probability of prize by collecting a broad clinical proof of the target , acceptance and treatment.
Stevens said , " This important new intervention should be provided and improved in the versatile and increasingly effective ways of preventing HIV . "
" It's another major achievement for more than 30 years in the struggle to tackle the greatest human health problem . "
" This is an important moment in the fight against HIV ," said Deborah Gold , head of the National AIDS Agency.
" If PR is properly targeted for the needs and risk groups , it can have an adverse effect on HIV-infective disorders.
Since September , a risk group will get a drug through a NHS - funded fund , whose use can decide independently without the need of negotiating with a partner. It has an empowerment effect which will improve the lives of many people. 
It was a welcome news " 
" Ian Green , chief of the Torrance Higgins Foundation , said ," It is now important to make sure that the test is started fast all over the country and it is not excluded from any risk group " .
" Pre - production medicine used for the trial has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect people from the 10,000 people group of HIV infections . "
Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said , "The introduction of the Pre - Pre - Pre - launch is a host ceremony that the government has failed for several months due to the fall . "
" We have evidence that drugs can have revolutionary effects on our work to prevent HIV and to eliminate this threat.
This test will help us to understand the real benefits of our private life.
It is now essential that the entire country is experimentally launched as soon as possible. In this way, we can protect HIV-infected people and see the situation where HIV is spreading infectiously. "  
Quality of life : Interlayer and fire extinguishing decoration arc court creates a small home
Joan Leigh , enthusiastic enthusiast for real estate reform , moved to a small apartment in Earl Court from a residential area in Knightsbag in 014 .
The apartment is located on the first floor of Queen Elizabeth's style house. The reminder that Joanne has still packed her camel and has changed 
" Before I live with my former Knightsbridge for a big apartment ," says Joanne .
" I'm looking for something similar to my price range.
I went to the apartment screen here and noticed that my rooms were as tall as my apartment.
I fell asleep straight away and got off on the same day. " 
After that , about 90 square feet housing has experienced a complete transition.
It was a bedroom apartment that came from the kitchen only. Joan wanted more storage space and wanted to use medium-level heights. 
" I wanted lots of space , big windows and light.
They were my claim , " he says.
He's from Nottinghill's Doc and Shade Planning Office. Hired to Erfan Azad. Erfan was given the use of the space of about four feet high and used to make an apartment that would be a house, not just a renovation and sales destination. 
The height of the furniture was not enough in two internal spaces , so the challenge was to build an intermediate , which could stand directly.
The solution demands Erfan 's creative thinking.
"The steel structures are quite complex.
Facilities were arranged on top of each other so that they could not be hammered.
Structural changes have been made so that the height is both right and right below them. " 
Erfan was able to place two full height rooms in room overlapping with impressive details.
The interneter opens with a copper grid window of the rearruas in an elegant living area.
Mirror furniture , silver effects and surges make Mouillen a unique style of vibration .
The drama , space and light emotions using the mirror .
The rectangle on each side of a small carrier will be more effective than the actual one.
The kitchen spaces' mirror is like a window open in another room.
Storage space for Joanna 's turtle and glassware inside mirror furniture .
The luck that is hidden in the kitchen when it is not used is more advanced.
Kitchen with folding doors is not a new solution ,
But at the Joanna 's kitchen is unique that the door is raised as well as the garage door.
" It took a bit of a design ," Erfan steel says MDF door veneered .
" It is balanced , that it is removed very easily when it slides. "
Joan has 16 additional squares , another bedroom and a good floor plan with the help of final space usage and storage space design .
" When the apartment is sold , the area solves - or purchases property ," says Erfan .
"In the case , a real estate agent walks into the apartment and drops the price on the basis of the area. "
Within Joanna 's apartment , the area was added using high-quality products that add luxury to space.
" Residential apartment materials are communicated , and tunnels from the apartments are partly based on them ," says Erfan .
" There is no branch of electric cable running through the wall.
They are very important , but not the same way " 
Joanna 's apartment is an example that can make a very delicate one in good design and extra large basement.
Then it may be that the apartment does not want to move far away.

The new chief of trump is planning to limit the president's media use
Others have tried and failed.
John F. Kelly can finally succeed.
The first.
Polatika According to the magazine , the White House Chief of Staff of the President of the Troop and tracking news media are limited, so the boss is also often a problem.
Supporter Josh Dzire reports :
" New Staff Managers of the White House, John F. Kelly , met with senior staff members on the first day of his work , he decides to solve the problem : he is willing to limit access to President Donald Trump.
Kelly told the White House employees that in both cases of printing and press conferences - they have to go because the President will get better information when the information gets better. " 
Kelly's words are understood , but others have tried to limit the use of trump media and have failed.
President Trump has a decade relationship with television - and as President he still has a lot of television.
"The presidential candidate of Trump was nervous about the unreasonable news coverage , but he showed that sympathetic media has driven more disciplined ," said Sam Nunberg , who worked as a councilor of the campaign for the tram , told the political newspaper in February.
Political reporter Tara Palmari writes in this post , " Six former preachers say that the use of Twitter's control of the troop is essential and a source of appreciation for his personal media flow. "
Clear .
But it is ridiculous to claim that Twitter's use of trump is never regulated.
Maybe this campaigner knows something we do not know - maybe the trim twins will be more leaner than their efforts.
We will never ever send messages to trump what message will ever be.
If his staff has been able to prevent him from troubles several times , his job has not failed.
However , no one was able to withstand the fever-causing trump.
The problem is partly due to the fact that the White House has a competing team that supports trump related information, trying to suppress their case. That information can be reliable - or not. 
In May , Politiko wrote that the adviser deliberately gave the President's questionable information.
Editor Shane Goldsmith said in a case :
" Current and former employees of the tram say that they may be involved in newspaper scraps , which are criticized - especially if they say harmful data links, it should be immediately known when the information comes from.
It was about to conclude February when someone gave a copy of the news website to the President GotNews.com, Charles A. Johnson Johnson , the deputy chief of staff blames Kate Walsh on various White House data links.
Johnson was permanently removed from harassment on Twitter , and he previously filed false allegations and later withdrew them. And he did not provide any strong evidence. 
Nevertheless , Trump began reading the story of Walsh's employees asking. " 
Golmeshwar also said that Ryan Pius , HR Manager at the time , and the White House Secretary of Kepler Rob Peter , tried to establish a document management system of trams.
And what was the result ?
Kelly tried the same thing after three months.
Perhaps he became a more effective leader than Preburs , but Trump is still following his own self- perpetual self and his colleagues still following their own issues.
Kelly's task of this irreversible event is extremely difficult to make.

Espoo company MariaDB develops the world's " fastest growing " open source database.
Curious entrepreneur Michael " Monty ", the main product of Madeenius, does not cost users any of the Mariadabis and it can be made by anyone with the help of a great programmer.
For example , Google and Wikipedia are a Finnish database user , but customers can not pay.
Enables databases to have a large amount of information that is steadily available and quickly available.
For example , using Linkedin , Twitter or Booking.com , they use the database of MySQL or MySQL.
" No, there is information that the image format , a database, and from the pictures it is connected to the " uideniyasa explains.
Widenius, MariaDB is a technology manager , celebrating half of his time.
A person working in the service of the Kununinayne manages to ensure that the internet operates remotely.
Widenius has developed MySQL, the world's most popular open-source database together with Swedish company David Axmark .
2008 In , the sun has earned billions of dollars for MySQL , and a year later , Oracle Surface 7.4 billion purchase of software
When the Oracle transaction happened , a large part of MySQL developers announced their departure.
" Those who do not want to work for Oracle have not given a specific commitment to MySQL's future ," Widenius recalled.
At this stage, he has already set up an institution for the development of MariDobi.
He does not want to die of his life
I 've provided 20 developers for the Sun , so I've secured the continuity of code with the same friends that made it.
Since MySQL is an open source database , Mariadby was able to develop its own branch.
The name must be changed only.
A foundation was established under the guidance of MariaDB 's code development.
" MySQL does not backup this ," Widenius is annoying.
Although most are broad and have heard about MySQL's billions of commerce , but some of them know about Finnish Marianbi.
" Mariju's CFO Kenneth Pakwallen says ," In recent years our growth rate has been around 50 percent per year " .
Mariadab , which insists on growth , is still not making any profit , and Fakhlen is the key figure of an overwhelming company.
So far , he has revealed that in the current fiscal year , Mariadibi estimates that it will receive an order worth 20 million euros.
Since the databases are free , the company that wishes to provide services for it has been developed around it
If the customer uses a closed database, MariaDB may also be in a year , that helps to exchange data
Switching from MySQL to Mariadob can be because they are each other's version
Among other things , the Spanish operator Telefonica and the largest bank of Southeast Asia DBS are offering MediDi customers.
Most popular cloud services , such as Amazon Amazon , Microsoft Azure , Alibaba Cloud , are offering MariDB to their customers
At the same time , Mariadab is automatically distributed to new users in Linux distribution packages , where Mariadby basically replaces MySQL.
Although we are a small firm , we have links to the biggest gambling players
"The world's largest telecom operators , gaming companies , banks and even some central banks among our customers ," Phenchen list
The giants like Oracle , Microsoft , IBM and SAP are still in the database market with their closed database.
Oracle's MySQL company is a decent web site compared to the traditional closed database.
Although research firm Gartner said that in recent years the largest database companies have lost market access , on the basis of turnover , gamblers as Mariadibi are still ineligible , although with fast growing syntax.
About $ 50 billion in the database market , the open source database does not even cost a billion.
However , the open source code can not be measured solely by money , because most users do not pay for this software.
Research firm Gartner predicted that 2018 in , companies are already 70 percent of their internal applications will create an open database.
In addition , over half of the old databases were exchanged at that time or at least the transition was started.
Large companies do not get new subscribers , since they are nominated for the most open source.
This led to license fee for commercial data by climbing clouds.
The company wants to make as much money as a small number of customers , "Widenius ponders
Since the exchange of a closed database is difficult , most subscriber companies have been mandated to increase prices.
" There are many customers for whom the transition is really hard because their old applications and other closed databases are closed ", Widenius said.
He still believes that the measurement of customers is being fulfilled.
By increasing the license fee every year , the customer will be able to switch to the open source database sooner or later.
The price is 10-20 percent before , and the service is good because the customer can easily change to another database if you wish.
However, most companies are facing major system changes while migrating their activities to the cloud service.
At the same time , many changes are database software.
Last spring , Meridiba received 25 million euros from European Investment Bank at EIB .
This is the largest growth fund of the Nordic countries given by the EUB.
About 115 employees of the company are being hired worldwide and now more.
One reason for the IiB fund was the effect of Mariadabir on the purchase of people's IT.
For example , the company is a public sector customer in Britain and Germany.
Provides annual million euro dollar databases in the public sector of Europe.
" Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use more efficient tax houses ," Pankhenen said.
How much is spent on the Close Health Care system in Windies Finland, when the open systems are cheap and the customer is not in the mercy of a software company.
Say something open source is an ideology , but I think it's a good way to create code.
The community can help and do something that you do not come or can not do.
55- year-old Widenius is another Linux developer, among the most well-known open source developers, Linas Torvalds .
Wikinews helps other agencies build effective business models in open source.
I still have 4-5 words worldwide on this issue every year.
Italy NGO Rescue strengthens its attitude towards ships
Italy non - governmental organizations warn that refugees should be rescued in the Mediterranean so that they do not carry out their activities until they are compelled by the new rules of their activities.
Interior Minister Marco Minini said in an interview with Turin's La La Stampa , " If NGOs do not adhere to the new code of ethics , then it is difficult to see how they can continue their work. "
Manitin warns a day after the Italian authorities arrested the German joint rights ship. His crew suspected of cooperating with human trafficking campaign in illegal immigration 
Just a year ago , the relief agency refused to comment on the prosecution's complaint against Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
In a statement published in Social Media , the organization said , "It will be the most important thing to save our lives and we are very sorry that we are currently unable to work in the search and rescue areas. "
" We only collect all the information when we can evaluate the charges and we are able to evaluate the situation. "
Since October, Italian authorities have been monitoring the Jugand Rittet Iwenta platform.
The suspects are suspected of reclaming the boat directly in the boat by sheltering the refugees directly into the boat.
One such case is claimed to have happened only two kilometers from the Libyan coast. This information is reflected in the prosecutor's file , which is published by the Italian media. 
The crew is suspected to threaten the Italian Coast Guard , which operates rescue operations in the region. Empathy for help in policy 
According to the practice code , vessels as yantas will be operated by an Italian police officer who operates operations.
Only nine of the nine non - governmental organizations involved in the search and rescue operation agreed to follow the action plan : Save Child and Multishous MOS and Spanish Pro - Activa Open Arms ,
Those who announced on Thursday that the new rules will not be unnecessary but acceptable because they are not " significant changes or obstacles " for rescue operations of the organization.
Those who refused to abide by the Code of Conduct, Nobel Prize winner Doctors Without Borders
Mr. manititi think that , in Italy the number of immigrants in Italy has decreased dramatically in the past few weeks , as he noted , the Libyan upakuladutake to strengthen and support the local mayors and the results will begin to produce results.
"In the last few days , the light has started publishing at the end of the tunnel ," the minister said.
He revealed that , this month, the mayor and the economic development projects in Libya, Chad , Niger and Mali would be to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
A case for the prosecutor - Seasonal worker is suspected of the murder of the suspect found in his unmarried partner Enontekoe, suspected territory
In December, there was a suspected crime in the intunoscope in Kutenan.
Police said a 36- year-old checkpost was suspected of killing a Scottish 6 year old single unmarried partner.

Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for stimulating the text in suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison for being sexually assaulted for suicide in the text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter , II 0, in prison for 15 months and sentenced to five years in prison.
Carter was sentenced to death in June. Her boyfriend conrad riot suicide 13.7.2014 . 
" My family has crashed ," Conrad's father said in the session on Thursday.
" My son was my best friend. "
Appeals to Carter Roy and the application waits for the independence process.
The two 0 -year-old was threatened with imprisonment , but according to his lawyers , Carter and Roy both suffer from mental health problems.
Carter wearing red pants and cream - colored blouse heard the hands of adjacent judges with a crying look in the summer.
" His staff killed Conrad Ray ," the prosecutor told the court.
" He made his own progress in Conrad's life decision.
He has taken responsibility for the law , "the prosecutor continued.
" He does not show repentance. "
Carter's lawyer said , " Carter deeply regrets " in " awful circumstances "
Judge Lawrence Muniz believes that Carter's " age or maturity level , even mental health problems , have a significant effect on his work " .
The prosecutor's statement read Conrad's mother Lynn Ray , where he said to me : " I have never spent a day , so I can wake up in the death of my dear son.
I'm proud of him and want to deal with all of this. I will always try to comfort this sister of her sisters that we will always tolerate. "  
Conrad's sister told him that kaddi judgment , the concept " oppressed " seems to be that , he will not see his brother's wife, and his children do not desire.
" Every day since my birth, I suffer from losing a person in my life , that this pain will not go away from my birth " .
The case appears to be an example , since there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that the incitement of suicide will be a criminal offense.
Carter died in a car crash in 014 at the age of 17 .
The case draws national attention when it becomes clear that Carter encouraged her lover to commit suicide in her text messages.
" Within two weeks before the death, he sent a message many times :" Throw yourself a lot and throw it , I do not know myself. " Roy was then on vacation with his family. 
Prior to Roy's suicide , Carter wrote , " You have to conrad it , " and " you have to start a generator and you're free and happy. "
Judge Menez said , Carter was involved in the death of Ray. The judge granted that interview will not benefit from Carter Case. 
Experts in the case highlighted the views.
Only saved a few of Carter. The 007 in the UK charged with the murder of his brother in Italy Amanda Knox (30) . He was murdered by his brother in Italy in 007 . 
The Los Angeles Times has expressed the opinion of Knox, which he says : " Michelle Carter is not a prisoner , condolences and needs help. "
NATO Secretary-General : You were the worst since the Russian Coast Ward
NATO Secretary-General Jane San stebarabarga comments on Thursday , NATO, and Russia clearly bad.
Stoltenberg accused his position of his position in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine
I think NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it was before the Cold War ended , Stoltenberg said in a CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War , we hoped that we could fight for close cooperation with Russia.
However , in 2014, in the Crimea and eastern Ukraine, Russia, illegal attachment of the growing instability , Russia's relations with NATO have been bad enough.
According to stolatenabargera , NATO is still committed to the work , so that the tension does not get stuck.
As long as we are strong and long as we are closer , we can join Russia in a political dialogue to avoid the situation and the new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg 's comment , US President Donald Trump found that the US - Russia route has gone even in a dangerous stage
Congratulations to the congressional country for tragedy bad news , which last week approved the new anti-Russian ban.
Audible changes in the 850,000 diesel engines caused by the manufacturers' experience
On the day before the announcement of Audi , BMW offered to update 350,000 software updates.
The company's BMW head company believes that " restrictions have more reasonable alternatives than driving " he mentioned in European cities , the motherland of BMW , which considers the use of diesel to be limited or prohibited. 
On Tuesday , more than three million Mercedes - Benz announced the change of engine to reduce the detergent's diesel reduction .
No company talked about the callback.
Atomokarsira Europe and the United States, the European CA 2 emissions of diesel vehicles to achieve the targeted marketing has been widely used.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to be cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing emission neutralization equipment will increase , which makes it difficult for the car to price competitive.
German car makers closely monitored , and Chancellor Angela Merkel was lobbying big car companies and ignoring the problems.
The company is trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, making a fake device in Voltswog cars which reduce the emissions to comply with the regulations. In normal driving , warmth was high.  
A number of Volkswagen leaders have been added to the United States , but leaders are being investigated by both the Atlantic groups.
Last month , the former director of Audi's Motor Development Department , the head of the power plant , was arrested in Germany.
Jakaki Giovanni Pamio is Italian , so he can surrender in the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year , Oxy was caught in a criminal investigation by Volkswagen. Authorities suspected that Audi had installed the fraud of European emissions requirements in a system of their car. There was a similar charge in the US based on the investigation.  
Audi's investigation could significantly reduce the Volkswagen status : The share of Volkswagen's profit luxury car manufacturer is unclear.

Climate Change Provencal Lavender Threats
Lavender has become the symbol of the South French Provence region , but now it is threatened by climate change.
Salinity is reduced due to drought and pesticide diseases. Science and farmers are struggling to find solutions to the problem. 
" Errors Cheeses , an expert at Crippam Research Center for Product , said :" Lavender has been affected by the effects of climate change in recent years as it is endangered in the provinces region. "
" This lavender shortens the lifespan
In addition , many small strains of appetite that have been brought to the expanded areas of microbes. " 
Butts are difficult.
Lavender oil attracts tourists , and is also extremely beneficial material for perfumes and cosmetics.
" Instead of long poking and big flowers , now we have small flowers that are poorly developed or weak or completely absent. "
"In other words , essential oils containing oil are less. "
The solution is intensified by an irrigation , evaporate the soil moisture and spray the plant with a protective clay and water matching. In addition , the more resistant type of drought is enhanced. 
Reflects the growing threat of a journalist in Mexico
Once a week , Sunday's weekly publication of Raidois generally came together on Wednesday to discuss how organized crime , the most recent cases of corrupt authorities , and the continuous drug trafficking of the state of Sinilla are discussed in the journal.
However , at present , the recent tragedy concerns security.
Journalists have been asked to change their daily routine.
Two experienced journalists discuss what's safer: leave the kids home or involve them in the delivery that was a grenade hit in 2009.
Security experts wrote three words on the chalkboard in front of the room : the opponents , the neutral , the associate.
They called journalists to name each group. No evidence is required , monitoring and feeling are sufficient. 
The name of drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen and journalists who are suspected of being entitled to a government or drug outlet. They threaten a life of criminals who send messages to Mexico 
Violence continued , and reporters are increasingly subject to attacks. According to the supplier's safety committee , at least 25 journalists were killed after the resignation of President Enric Pina in December 01 , 2000 . 589 attackers and threatened journalists in the United States federal This year , at least seven journalists were killed in seven states.  
The latest victim is Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder , editor and Riodoca inspiration.
" The biggest mistake in Mexico and to be a journalist ," Valdez wrote many books on drug abuse.
He always likes though he exists everywhere. The proponent of the Rydoka building is covered by a huge picture where Valdis looks like a middle finger. The film says : " Wright " dressed in a T - shirt decorated by the thirty-year-old journalist Aaron Ibarra and Maryam Ramries Valdis's smiling face . Valdez made a trademark of glasses and a brandy.    
The meeting will be held less than two months after the death of Valdez . Reporters discuss their general trauma , nightmares , insanity and harmful fears. 
II 010 , in order to deal with cases against journalists a federal special prosecutor's office was set up , but the journalist, according to the committee , so far only two cases have been filed.
Reporter faces trial with the killing , as well as thousands of drug addicts and organized crime every year , only a few appear in court.
Although Riodocen journalist Sinaloa is planning to follow violent writing , they are mourned and the situation is more dangerous.
According to Ibera , the Security Conference is used a little because murderers did not know and there is no hope of justice.
" This meeting is a waste of time literally ," he says.
" As long as we do not know the facts, we can not believe anyone. "
On the morning of May 15 , Valdés released the Rhodoca delivery in the capital of Quliakan ,
He driven away just a block of his red toy when two men stopped him and forced him to his car and fired twelve shots. This magazine is considered to be the name of the magazine : Redós means twelve rivers. 
The shooter turns off Valdez 's car and crashes it off some distance.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was a wife and two adult children
Rumors are fast and floating freely in Kuala Lumpur.
However , Valdez 's death is still a mole.
Gujman was arrested last year and after being transferred to the United States in January, Senlio has become the most bloody battlefield in Mexico. Competition groups want to fill in void. 
One or more people were shot dead every day in the streets of Silinho, and there are two cemeteries in the graveyard of big drug addicts as compared to many families.
The coastal state is " peaceful " when only a cartel suppresses the ports and drug trafficking in the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work , 60- year-old Reedov , its founder and leader Ismail Bozhorakz, felt reluctant to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes lead to the murder of the Valdis.
In February , Reiodes published an interview with Damos Lopez. He led a competing group which goes against Guzman Boys. 
The story can disturb Gujmán's son : The magazine came to the sales journal as suspects arrested by the magazine suspected of purchasing every item of the magazine.
The second mistake was that Valdez was forced to leave the country and attacked another magazine published in the same magazine.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his assassination journalists are seen as a turnaround in the violence.
He is so much alive that his friends and colleagues can not fear him.
He made a long career in Norway when he decided to join Rondoca with five colleagues in 2003 . Then the stock of the magazine was sold for $ 50 . 
Sinaloa " impossible to do journalism without tackling drug issues ," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine became familiar with his brave and honest stories and increased sales and advertising revenue.
Journalists praised the possibility of publishing hard-core journalism without fear of censorship and was impressed with the publication of stories that no one dares to publish.
Eight years after his foundation , Redoys won the prestigious Maria Mors Cabot Award for news coverage in Latin America.
In the same year , Valdez received the International Press Freedom Award for the Committee of Journalists for not knowing the case of Mexican drug trafficking for courage.
He clearly acknowledged that he was afraid.
" I want to be able to continue my life ," he said when he received the Committee's Award for the Protection of Journalists.
Drug Trafficking " Life Style " in a Sinaloa , Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October
"The reporter should acknowledge the work he's doing - or be stupid.
I do not want anyone to ask me where I was in to buy the seeds of death - why did I tell you what was not ? " 
There is a need for a Validija scammer working in Reddoka, which is as a broker. They got a friend who always suggested Miss Hogg and they missed a teacher , who will know how to deal with it.  
They believe in his routine.
He always used Panahmutu.
He went on opposite times at El Guayabo and was always sitting in the same table.
Now they are asking that the routine is taking away their fate.
Due to the death of a colleague, they can think about how well they can live and survive.
" We do not like criminals if we deal with their women and children and their clean business , their secret drug smugglers.
They came out of the box , " said Bojoraki
It is good case , strong self - censorship and self - protection ,
Believe in my instincts.
If you think everything is wrong , then you have to stay away.
The problem with Reddowo's journalist Anders Villarreal is " Cheating can be cheated , and Javier sued . "
Old rules are not applied to Sanlano and they do not apply to the dangerous networks of Tamamipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and other states : interesting runner routes , weak organizations and corrupt authorities.
The business environment is constantly changing.
Redorra security training can not be brought to a room in the cell phone when it is being held. A few days ago , it became clear that government - sponsored spyware programs were followed by activists and journalists in Mexico . 
Outside the building , two policemen took refuge from a tree shade of 40 degrees Celsius.
The state government located in a building of four rooms in the middle class Kuala Qalan area , was ordered to protect the premises of Riodoche .
Some journalists have been told about Ardh Chandra , 50 percent of these two policemen were police , which the state governor did not believe.
The journalists had months of being in the mountainous rural areas controlled by the drug genius.
This week's version spawned three main stories of the delivery of Rhodocho
Julio Sior Chavez's brother killed in Syliloos in connection with the kidnapping of Chennai
The newspaper also wanted to publish that the government was spending the governor's residence.
In addition , a block away from the public prosecutor's office , one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants , is kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information about how to kidnap and how , how careful was to be used : Dude everyone knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug traffickers and the authorities.
The reporter's public documents found that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician of the ruling Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) . PPI has dominated Mexican culture of all levels for almost a century. 
The UK governor has recently been accused of corruption in most cases.
The villagers asked to write about the previous case in the same place. One of them , " El Chapo " Guzman's boy escapes and avoids an army expedition. 
A few months ago , readers knew that Valdez 's column was a reliable information about the abduction.
46 -year-old Villarreal said , " In the past , we already knew what happened ," ohukanenera name " El phalo " known as , because of the structure of his body
" Now all connections to our data sources are broken. "
The office of Valdez has turned into a warehouse that puts the markers and stickers against the journalists ' torture. Employees of the magazine received a new , unexpected job : they became media activists. 
Journalist Mariam Ramrez took some signs with him , when he was killed in the local lawyer's office for a protest the next morning, after the murder of journalism he was murdered.
Salvador disappeared in the west of Mikoyakan three days after Adam Welled's assassin.
After the disappearance, a burnt body was discovered based on the DNA test conducted by the authorities.
The reporter started to strongly protest across the country. During the demonstration , the " SOS Press " is displayed in pavets and buildings. 
Today , Director Bojorquez is in Washington , where he is trying to get international support for Valdez's investigation into the case.
The day after the murder of Valdez , Ramirez met with the Governor of Sinaloa and told the fact that the authorities said that because spying and killing journalists
Later he was called to be expelled from the government's case because he worried that he could not be crazy being the motive.
Valdez has repeatedly said that in Mexico , the journal is surrounded by organized crime , authorities allow crime and indifferent society
In his last book , Narada journalism Valdez wrote that narcotics killed journalists , but they were killed by the order of politicians and security forces in concert with organized crime.
According to Artikulo 19 , more than half of attacks on journalists last year were created by police and authorities.
"In Mexico , people are silent by killing ," Ramirez says.
The killings have a depressing effect.
Six years ago, no one is taking any mission in the death of blogger Marla Elizabeth Mathias, north of Tamangipas border.
His body was signed by the message to the JetSu cartel : " I'm here because of Scripture. "
There were computer keyboards and headsets beside his cut head.
After the nephew of Miroslav in March, some newspapers, including El Noret newspaper in northern Chihuoa border province, decided to stop working.
Something is going on , including Nvo Laredo El Manana , although its leader was murdered in 2004 .
The 010 In , dayariya D sidada jureja expressed its home page a message for drug addicts : " You want us to do ?"
Some journalists have fled to their states or across the country.
The decision is difficult.
In the rural areas it is difficult to find a job , and all the time you have to be cautious
" Sometimes criminals are looking for a journalist , as apparently came Ruben Espinosa , who was killed with four women in Mexico City apartment in 2015 after fleeing from Veracruz for three months
"To continue their work , every day dangerous decisions are met
" Iberra , whom he once called a poet , admits that writing about drug trafficking is scary.
" She said ," I became a journalist because Mexico is on the way to the ship " .
" Some time ago , Rodouro's journalist was sitting on the night on Friday night when the last issue of the magazine was completed and suddenly their phone started to color for a message.

" Through the delivery of Radoo, the founder of the magazine continued the tradition of killing the creator under this huge portrait , where people looked like a middle finger for the whole sinoos.
" Bosevovaz says he can not leave. " How can I stop the magazine when our trainee was going to do the same thing for the killer of Xaviar to go to the street ? "  
Heno Maninni's Olympic project began with a huge back load - " Hard Place "
In April , Heno Maninin , the 39- year-old party was brief , started preparing for the Olympic Games as a professional pilot.
But when the maninenake fell ill, the training started.
It started out a long period of illness that stretches for about five weeks
May be virtually completely in sickness in May
At first there was a flu and eventually there was a kind of childhood like an ear infection that I had to eat an antibiotic
I could only make up to ten percent of the planned exercise.

In the exam , the skier on the roller skate on a mat , whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes , the car stopped for about ten seconds and the tester took a milk sample at the fingertips of the athletes with a needle.
Until last I covered the carpet for 32 minutes , but now I was only 28 minutes.
It came against the wall , says Manininen .
Good direction

It was a morning for half a week for flight crew.
I went with my family to go to the cottage.
Last season , Manhattan took part in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Championship.
Manininen rose to the top when the best results are immediately seen in the initial competition of 18 .
The guidelines are drawn
Dominican and national team's head coach Patrick Cookenne completed the training and competition plans until February.
We are now trying a different tune of exercise compared to last season.
After the first world championship , Rooka will be on a weekend tour of three World Cup races.

Dinosaur protects himself by enemy himself by enemy himself
At first it shows a scary statue.
Now researchers have found the first research results of a reno - shaped organism that has been discovered by a Canadian mine worker , so that experts claim to be Diana's Mona Lisia .
It was so well preserved that even scientists were determined that her skin was brown in red and was a " problematic past " .
According to current biology , it is the best preserved armored dinosaur ever and the best species in the world.
The recently discovered fossils mean a nodosaurus, which means mid-season between 110-112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this wonderful well - preserved fossil as a really important discovery.
According to National Geographic , armored spinach - Vegetable best preserved fossil of its type.
This is the 1 March 011 on the alabartote sanakara Canadian Millennium mine was found , and it was discovered by Sean phinka mining companies.
He does not seem to be a natural part of the rock which hit something , and decided to look at his results more closely.
The fossils found in the rock were sent to Tyrrell Royal Paleontological Museum .
There was a hole of 100 kilograms of boulders for six years in the bee .
Hard work results are now visible.
Science - Fiction writer Caleb Brown said , " If you enclose the eye , you can fall asleep ," he worked as a researcher at the Terrell Royal Museum.
" This is the Dinosaur Mona Lysana , one of the most beautiful and best-kept dinosaurs in science history.
Leather studies have shown that eating dinosaur meat could be a major threat to this vegetarian , although it was a body weapon and similar to a walking tension tank.
From its predominance , red-faced shoulders masks , and it was also protected from dark and light colors that still exist among many organisms.
According to experts , it was able to mix with their environment and was able to avoid their enemies , greater dinosaurs
110 million-year-old nodosaurus May headline and the Tyrrell 's Royal Palaeontological museum is displayed.
Scientists named it Mitttekelli's museum technician Mark Mitchell as BitoAlop. The Mitchell team , which has dinosaurs for 7,000 hours. 
Nodosaurus Mistle and international scientists have been so wonderful that the size and size of the armor has been able to determine the size and size.
They discover that it is still protected by an ordinary color animal , where the body is dark and light.
There is much more observation than the color current animals of Borolaop.
This can be proven , meat eating dinosaurs were in such a way that the evolution of the war as a means of survival rather felt hideout.
Existing animals have similar look like deer , sepros and armadillo . They were small enough and caught easily , suggesting that the nodosaurus was seriously threatened. 
" The prediction of a large , heavy armored dinosaur tells us how dangerous dinosaurs were ," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in nodosaurus revealed that her skin was red brown.
Scientists continue to study nudosauras to decide on his life. They investigate the intestinal content , otherwise , to find out what they eat a last meal . 
Scientists believe that , when he died in the river and sank beneath the sea, where he returned to sea
At that time Alberta was warm because it is now in Florida , and beyond which rivers and seas can still pass beyond.
" This nodosaurus is really remarkable because its smooth skin has been preserved and it has saved three levels in its original form ," Brown said.
" Why It Look Like The First Early Contract Period
It does not require much imagination for understanding : if you have a little tears you can believe that you were almost asleep. " 
This relation was the era of the poem , the two legs , the meat dinosaur , and dinosaurs.
Although their King , Tireons auras Rex or Borial Game a few million years ago , his powerful predecessors could catch the dinosaur.
Tyrannosaurus rex predecessor included , for example , Acrocanthosaurus, a 11.5 meter long six - monster demon.
The latest results of Nodosaurus researches have been published in current biology. They believe that Borolof was washed off from the sea after his death and he wiped from the clay. 
This is the 1 March 011 on the alabartote sanakara Canadian Millennium mine was found , and it was discovered by Sean phinka mining companies.
According to the museum , it is on the side of the world's best preserved armored dinosaurs and shoulders on their shoulders and shoulders.
The average of Nodosaurs was five meters long and measure up to 1,300 kilograms.
Mountains of two halfmeter from their chambers emerged
Scientists believe that this Burmese Chavez does not travel in present-day Canada, until the floods lead to the open sea.
His armor has been preserved in a small story of submarine pants.
Its fossilized remains are so well preserved that its skin is in a vaulted vessel with its skull.
Michael Gersko writes in National Geographic that such a conservation "is rare like a lottery.
More closely it seems more amazing.
The ball's still rock tapered plate are the fossilized skin.
Her right leg is on her side , five toes are up.

How to learn to answer a worker question : those streets on the streets ?
9 September , the 014 on pherarele Brittany was deeply shocked
He came to his home in St. Louis, a day before New York and sat on his bed in his airbagh apartment and browsed his phone on Facebook.
Then he noticed a message from a high school friend :
" Police killed an 18- year-old young man , and his body is still on the street. "
With the confusion he noticed that no one else had sent the same information to his feed. That's why he closed on Facebook and opened Twitter. 
There were many re-openings in his timeframe by @Thefaroah
The nickname is a Pope resident of St. Louis , who was engaged in real-time with Michael Brown's death. White police expelled 18- year-old black-haired Brown in Ferguson , Missouri . 
It was four hours left where the user had posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street.
" This is incredible ," Ferrell thought.
But death and his community were nothing new to him.
He made his phone out. That night when he returned to Twitter , he told people to gather on the Congestion Drive. 
Users posted photos of police jawbones and shouting people and Brown's parents , he claimed that the man was saying in placard : " Ferguson's police killed my unarmed boy !"
Ferrell followed the real-time video , where the police shout with the dogs standing in front of protesters.
He said that he saw a video where another police member ripped his rifle and shouted , " I'll kill everyone ... animals. "
" This is not normal ," recalled Ferrell .
" It is not such a killing that we used to be , which can usually be thought to be.
Then I felt cold colors
I was angry and cried. " 
The next day he booked a return flight home.
The plane landed at eleven o'clock in the evening. Ferrell decided that his father went to his six year old daughter and they will go to Ferguson next morning. 
What happened to Ferrez and Ferguson in the next three years is a documentary movie " Car Streets ?" 11 August , the 017 on the premiere of the film. 
This picture is a story of survival and miracles , love and loss , and the strength and perseverance of the local people , who demanded to get to the streets on the street.
When Farele was walking around Ferguson with a flower dress and crowned with a girl wearing a crown , how did they " live in black hair and in what situation ?" They spoke many times before the morning. 
" Do you think when I told you how to fight for the blacks they believed ?" Ferrell remembers her daughter. 
" We are going to Ferguson because police killed an 18- year-old boy , and it is not correct. "
" I can not take a daughter with me ," Ferrell said later.
" Today's events ... the final result of past events.
My daughter has the right to make it right and big to it.
She will be able to be actively involved in organization , but she will be familiar with the different levels of experience and circumstances of the black level. And we have to know what to do for our release , to free ourselves ? 
Although luckily I was able to protect him from innocent racism , he is still like other black girls.
I think I'll hurt him if I saved him from reality " 
Ferguson had their first stop in South Florida Road , opposite the police station. It became an activist camp when they were waiting to find information on this case and finally found out that no charges would be raised against the police. 
From there , Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who created the lunch package.
They packed the line in the bag and distributed them to demonstrators.
Ferrell gradually started reacting to a new-way activity.
" Our activism has changed completely after 9 August ," he says. While studying at Missouri University in St. Louis , Ferrell was the chairman of minority nursing student organization. At that time , he concentrated on food laws and health differences in black communities.  
" I have no experience in the organization.
Somehow it just happened. " 
A few weeks later , during the demonstration in the evening , Darry's deputy director Sabah Fellayen met with Ferrell .
Folian said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado - Farrah wanted to say " only " what is happening.
Ferrell's mind expresses suspicion. He asked , " Do you really say , is happening , or for which you want a story that you can use ?" 
Intrinsic suspicions were countless times when local community people , usually white people , who only benefited from their difficulty and persistence.
" We have heard that Ferguson was not born and was not a normal voice that was not raised ," Falien recently said in an interview. " We wanted to do something differently. " 
Falayan has already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis , who was working as a prisoner of death.
Davis's involvement Ferrell has been asked to join the project with six other locals. The incident happened for several years after Govinda's ammunition. 
" This is not a document where someone talks to us or speaks for us , but we're talking ," Davis said.
"For me , the most important thing is how local people are presented in this picture , because I see the same way. "
According to pholananera , pharelera experience was intended to focus on because it wanted to show the people's movement , " it is an immoral leader , rather than a community " . However , Ferrell proved to be the most transparent. 
The daramena pharelera praibhetike life surprisingly shows , such as love, definitely , definitely, and married.
" I think time is flexible ," laughed to tell what she felt to see the film for the first time in Farrell.
" But I realized that this work and black people need a specific risk of human image. "
In addition , Ferrell re-established the story of Black Black Women during the time and the Great Black Lives movement.
The 01 two police a black teenager in the expulsion of Martin treyebhana social media (# blyakalibhasa mother ) was born. Three founders of the movement identified themselves as chaos detection.
" Mustaine Queen - female leadership continues the whole movement ," says Ferrell. " It's because we have to constantly fight in the front. 
Black Queen women had to endure everything. " 
Folyan agrees : " This movement is actually driven by black women , including many prisoners. "
However , he stressed that Ferrell had not been selected for the document " for his own sake " because of his chaos.
" He got the strength to go ," Folayan said.
" However , it is not a coincidence that he is in the front line. Black young women live across many intersections , and they have to play a lot.
Its energy is transmitted from the screen. " 
The news senators have left Ferguson long ago , but the relationship between the community and the police is still intense.
The rest of the remaining half year is still in the condition of the return. He was sentenced to block the motorway in a demonstration. 
In his house the angle is social and political - its details are brief and concise : " Wrong. "
Yet he relied on the slogan that he had learned three years ago on the streets of Ferguson :
" Our duty is to fight our freedom
Our responsibility to win
We should love and support each other.
We can only lose our chain " 
An appropriate opinion : The artist created DNA portraits of Chelsea Manning
Phredamyana Gallery , New York , showroom hangs in the middle of faces - white , black and brown faces , which is very close to that view.
These 30 works include the artist Heather Dewey - Haggra's portrait based on Chilsa Manning's cheek and hair DNA sample .
Manning Fort sent a sample from Livennetown prison where he passed his 35- year rule. Manning was convicted for hijacking secret diplomatic bullets on the WikiLeaks site. 
The 7 August , the 017 on Dwayne - hyagabrorera rilyabalalansa a Bengal was opened.
This is based on two-year relationship between Dwayne - Haggard and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg brings together technology , information technology and the industry. Manning is a versatile and anti-earthquake protester , whose term of Barack Obama's prison term becomes soft on the third day of the day.  
Dewey - An analysis of Manning's DNA algorithm in Hegbourne created 30 portraits based on his genetic information . They are sharp , although somewhat theoretical , DNA information feedback , ambiguity and interpretation and identity intrinsic causes and impact relationships 
Chelsea Manning , whose birth name is Bradley Edward , has been told openly that she is identified with her loneliness with women. 2013 In , the spamming , computer fraud and theft, including 20 cases were convicted. 
Manning , who was sentenced to prison , he was the only picture : an exaggerated black and white sbarthi Manning, who mourning in which the driver is sitting in the car. He has a platinum stripe on his head , which became his trademark. 
The 015 In , Dwayne - hegabargera Stranger popularity bhijansa was a popular project , which he II 01 II was completed in.
There he made portraits based on forensic information. For example , cigarette collects DNA data from smoking and chewing gum , and creates pictures of how people can ask questions. 
The artist then received an email from the paper magazine.
" They interview Chelsea Manning and need a picture ," said a new show at a press conference in Dwai Hagberg.
Manning could not be visited and described in prison. So the newspaper asked Chelsea and asked whether she would be interested in porting a DNA to Manning. 
Mujahideen, the artist and his prisoner suddenly came to the reporters. For several years, they wrote each other. 
They even created a burnt image booklet , which was portrayed by Shoili Kanungo as it describes the future where President Chelsea will forgive the verdict and she will be able to see the show. 
Indeed , after publishing a comic book a few days after Obama decreed Manning's verdict. It was a lucky coincidence after seven hectares of years in the Kansas Military Prison. 
It is also impressive that Donald Trump is now launching his own war against information makers and transsexual forces and inventing new methods on Twitter that the exhibition is being opened to strengthen the actually suppressing strong teams.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that " everything has its purpose " .
The gallery's wall has an artist's statement and it's great autograph of Manning , where the last name is the heart I. According to him , the artist " claims an automated division claim that has the basis of gender , race , sex and culture " . 
The opposition wall has a manning DNA sequence : a long pencil written with a pencil , c , g and a.
This is 200 liters, or nucleotide , the artist used by the scientific definition, like , dyuye - hyagabrogera combination to explain how we're all the same , at least in our biology.
The exhibition features its 2007 secret memory video. 
" DNA tells innumerable stories. They have 30 here. "
The last work of the exhibition is in his own room : Manning and Dewey - a page from Haggoy's comic book.
It grew into prisons like Manning's character King Kong , holding a megaphon
The picture says , " They get down to you , they win "
"Do not be silent. "
An artist from Philadelphia said , " Text comes from a letter from Manning " .
" It's so impressive that I still get cold colors. "
Unlike comic books , Manning has not been seen yet. When Manning came, as a crowd in the middle of the showroom he used to speak his face based on his own genetic knowledge. 
It's deliberately , like everyone else in this show : For example , the DNA section of Manning is written with a pencil height, which is equal to its length (157.5 centimeters ) .
" Faces of the wall were before , but I wanted to bring a sense of humanity to them ," Dwayne - hyagabrom says.
" I wanted to portray Chelsea's mass movement , which was behind his release. "

Finance Love Britain skeptical about innovation : maternal health benefit packages, " there is no evidence "
British agency Finnish - doubts the benefits of the genre maternity package.
Among other things , the BBC and the Guardian report that the Löteby Trust , which fights for secret death , prohibits the use of its own brochure in the distribution of the motherhood package of Britain.
Distribution of Maternity Package for All Pregnant Women Scotland starts this month
In England , packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to the Lolabi Trust , there is no evidence that maternity packaging will reduce the risk of confidentiality.
Cash death marks a strange accidental death of the child.
Lleibath Trust is an expert in health care in the US as a child's safe dream.
We will no longer be able to pack our official brochures because it indicates that we recommend this product , the organization says.
Finland is one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world , only two deaths per 1,000 births.
According to the Loleby Trust , Finland's good education results in many factors , such as the number of teen pregnancies.
A box for each family is given that can actually be a factor.
However , it can not be said for sure , Francina Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust said.
We are worried that maternity packaging is sold as a product which reduces the death rate of children and cache death.
Motherhood Kit is a Finnish discovery and all mothers have been free for 80 years in Finland .
The package contains a variety of accessories , such as children's clothing
This year , there are 53 products on packaging .
Packaging itself is a cardboard box where the baby can go to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government , the boxes distributed by it fill all the security standards.
Lolabi Trust , as part of it , has no safety standards for the cardboard box.
According to the Lolabi Trust , packaging can not be a suitable alternative for any bed or pot.

The murderer villains are located away from the Japanese zoo
Japanese Zoo staff is looking for a flea turtle.
Giant Turtle surprised his motion staff and has already fired for two weeks.
On Tuesday morning , the turtles escaped from Shibakawa Chira in Okayama in western Japan.

This helps to avoid errors in your business at the beginning
Amy Errett wanted to measure employees' satisfaction with their online store startup business , but the questions did not work.
The answers were often vague , useless or even confusing
Although he confirmed that the questions were anonymous , some employees were suspicious to them.
" Carriages are not only compatible and are not intended ," says Erett. Like a hair care company , Madison Read focuses on e - commerce. The company has 75 employees.  
Errett decided to resort to external support.
Growing new types of human resources start-ups have reached the market so that other employees know how their employees are.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement. Companies can query and target them to specific teams and groups of people, and provide their employees with anonymous reporting services and, in some cases, direct contact with senior management in the government.
" Your own health can be followed by applications like Stroeu and Festivator , but where do companies bite ?" Jim Burnts, the founder and CEO of the start-up company of Redwood City. Glint provides companies with analytical software to measure employee commitments.  
Errett Glint has used the software for three years. He said , his employees are thinking and feeling deeper identity. 
The program can vote for quick questions and specific teams. In addition , it can create a map which at one glance shows that any departments are most dissatisfied with employees and those who receive the lowest rating. Based on this , Errett has been able to drill in the root of the problem.  
Businesses have realized that they should follow the culture at work so that they do not come from Uberia. The traffic company is scared around, because the former employee wrote on his blog that the workers who harassed about culture and who are talking about the problem are being punished. 
For starters like a gland , this kind of meaning is an attractive business opportunity.

Birth of a comic book : A castle story
Swedish music video is now as little Sky kasalake kilera kili and 1970 and 1980- during the Margaret Thatcher was known as a hiding place.
But behind it there is a history of about 700 years of storm. Now , this charming spot in the Bayouul river valley is a comic book theme written by Jami Rhodes , an old writer of old documents. 
" I think being able to study texts written by a dead person 300 years ago ," Rhodes thinks of the tricks
" I know a personal connection when I have a letter in my hand. "
Rhodes , a Castle in England , tells the story of Edwinian era from the middle ages of families living in Scotland. Each story is depicted by a different artist , a promising British cartoonist : Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith , William Exley, Becky Palmer , or Isabel Greenberg. 
This is not the first archive book on Roads. The 014 In , he was released from Dead Man's Teeth and end stories , whose inspiration was the British National Library documents. The project was emotional.  
"In the 18th Century, while sharing the camera, the letter written by a letter written in the letter " I went to the zoo and went to the zoo ", Rhodes said.
" It's his fingerprint !
And the smell of private smoke , because that is used as light light at that time
After three centuries , the smell reader felt that he was on the spot.
I love the archives ! " 
The old registered writer was able to live within the castle for almost four months, including the National Trust Foundation and the National Council of England , which seems very good to be true. He admitted that , he had hoped for longer than he can not stay in the palace. 
The Victorian " new " castle , archives , wealth - wealth and rarity , such as the walls and centuries - old lunar jhuliyechena his days on the bottle has been discovered.
He covered the old castle with ruins and layouts and talked with Forest guards , cattle , and sometimes even exemplary artists.
In the evening , he " took whiskey and started writing " .
The history of Scotland was quite unknown because the palace was completely transferred to the National Trust until the last heir died in 2006 .
Ten years later, when Rhodes came to the scene , the staff of the Foundation started looking for the archives. Rhodes describes that archived for hundreds of years by the same method : Keep extra items hidden. 
The archives were diary , the letters of England's empire and what owned maps. " One can imagine that land lawsuit is cold ," Rhodes said. " Here , however , fight up to one Birch tree of the family .  
It is my mind that I suppose it may already be. " 
Parts of the book goes from castle to English history , such as Labor. It speaks to a man , that soon after the completion of the castle , soon 1381 in English, became citizens. 
" Knutley Families of Kenneth and Sussex mention that the book was a riot in the castle in 1380 ," explains Rhodes.
"The British peasants started in the same area , and recalled that the insurgency could start in the riots.
Probably related to this incident ? " 
Other books in the book are closely related to the history of the castle - like The Priest , a story of a priest who was secreted by the Darrell family for seven years for the reform of England.
Smuggler tells the stories of 18th- century smuggler Arthur Darrell. He called the coffin filled with stones and called his vocal sculpture ( even after opening his grave ) . 
Darles is the favorite family of Rods in Scotland. "The family looks like a pretty friend, they constantly lend and buy things that they can not afford. 
Men in Darrell family marry rich elderly women and solve their debt problems. I see them beautiful friends who are able to expel the criminals. "  
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experience.
He spent two weeks in phinise , he wrote a playful about ithanamamaki , two 0 -century of early helalara , only a euthanized plot is.
Skain Castle has a special place in her heart.
" That leaves two : thus it was ," he says.
" I did not want to go back to this bad day's life. "

Lahlyla started her dog in 2006 after her career.
I was in my place for the first time for the first time at the age of 15 .
I did not really do anything , said Lahatla.
During his coaching period , Lathella often challenged his keeper in ramp and physics.
Surprisingly , the stopping was a great experience.
I was so tired of body and emotionally that my thoughts were not understandable.
Not even with the species
The place is going well.
I really enjoyed it , I was not really right , because.
A mandatory success for Lahtela 's Finnish coach.
Without stop , he fears that it will end.
It's easy to find places that have gone missing for Kavota !
Without an accident, I did not realize that I had to rest so much.
Lahlya started the Finnish team team coach a year ago.
At the same time , he found a safe hobby in floating types of places.
I changed motorcycles from frisbebogy !
It comes out immediately from the floor immediately
At the worst time I threw myself seven times seven times.
Although Lahtela has always been an ultra skilled coach , she does not need to be the same as the coach her.
I do not go into the same mold.
Our varietal culture has its own style of place and the best way to be in the world.
Freestyle is a free style , and mentality has always been on the line , says Lahtela .
Sex robots are coming and we have to think about it
Here it is : a report about the development of the technology of sex robot industry - just as the start of seeing 017 is no longer weak.
Yes .
Sex robot is a big deal now
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( RRR ) recently released a report of development of sexual robots in 5-10 years.
Founder member of the Foundation and professor of Chemistry at Noble Shark University of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. Md. Mahbubur Rahman said , " We must look at the popularization of sex robots. "
Customers can choose the colors of the robot's eyes , nipples and nails.
" Sex robots are condemned , but they have already sold a lot , and we will see them more ," Sharky said in a report in a public announcement.
Sexcrafts have evolved from flashy doll to robots in a warm silicon skin and artificial intelligence like humans.
Customize user's eye color, nipple shape and nail type, and color from Robot's own preferences.
Even more worrying is that there is a " personality " of Robots that looks like the progressive raiders of Staffford women.
Sex practices with silicone skin have developed into robots.
For example , the features of RealBottix robot can be made according to user preferences , for example.
True Companion's Roxxxy Gold Robot has a pre-program personality : Frigid Farrah seems to fade , Wild Wade is so adventurous and so on.
"Roxxxy's gold personality follows the user's person perfectly ," the company's website is notified.
In other words , robots like the user liked the same thing.
It has different moods :
It can be tired , it's a mood or a mood.
There are many difficulties in popularizing sex robots. They replace real human relationships , but it is more dangerous for females and straight rape fantasies when a user comes forward , for example , a shy and oppressed program robot. 
The true companion roxxxy his robot compared to his vibrator :
" Women have a tremor, why should not men make sexual robots ?"
Sex robots , but not just an idol or a new type of sex toy.
Their encouragement and development tells us deeper and deeper in our culture : a recession from gender equality towards sexual intercourse , where subordination is an alternative among others.
Of course , most men do not have sexual robots , and their popularity is still marginal , although the FRR reports say they are growing in popularity.
Limited events , however , tell a lot about the soul during the time.
And many will have to behave oddly or insulting when allowed in the market.
It is not a coincidence that sexual robots have started to become more common at the same time and women's rights around the world have been threatened and the White House is sitting on a president who is disturbed about harassment of women.
Television series The hyandamaindasa Tale ( arjatatarasi ), its powerful imagery, the worst thing about it is , for example , a lomapathi body and eye-opening picture of the most boring thing in the world how it feels series. 
Gilead Republic is far from our reality , but now it seems an amazing short journey.
Think technically as a sexual robot, trying to do real women ( porn ratio ) .
Robot developers want to think their skin as real and the pace imitates the human movement as much as possible.
However , their " personality " is far from reality.
Robot can not get away from the relationship or situation.
They do not have their own desires or history - there is nothing against the imagination of self - reliance or complete confidence.
They are delightful servants.
Servants of slaves
Police suspect : Two terrorist plans were planned in Australia , operated by Isis
Austria's agency Aizis suspects planning to take a bomb from an Etihad Airways plane leading a group of Austrian men .
According to the Sydney Morning Herald , the leading character of a person , in Sydney sent bomb.
According to the suspects, the bomb was used on July 15 , but the company was suspended before security checks.
The police will not know why police will suspend you.
Another suspected terrorist plan was to build a poisonous colorless gas separator and take up the top of the public transport , such as public transport in a public place .
Australian Federal deputy deputy commander Michael Felena said that there was a terrorist plan among the most professional plans made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist planning , four people were arrested on Saturday police operation.
One of the men is released , but his test starts again.
Good side of tram ?
Meet Mitt Romney is good because look like a hell
Trump has been repeated up to season saturation , which has strong categories of voters in daily level , detached families also.
On Christmas and Thanksgiving Day , American magazine ' Counseling Plates provides guidance on how to handle tram relatives.
We all want to pierce our information bubble.
Trump capacity has been given less attention to integrating families
I'll tell you about this because my cousin made this week in New York with me in a village. The leftist poet, who was in Chicago for a long time with our fellow Republicans deride - taunting. 
He remembered that a common enemy might have a strong unified effect.
Now that trump is in White House , my cousin , all known - with a restored classmate for whom he was controversial for several decades - suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side
At the dinner table , that is a good thing , but in a broader sense , it involves significant risks.
The tram left a new stream on the left , but the distorted influence of its president can actually be all our rights.
When we Trump and " normalization " talk about , when we talk about the scary possibility that one day we will not be able to scare tactics.
In the long run , it is more dangerous , tramapa as usual right-wing ripabalikanaderake , who trupira compared to suddenly feel very well.
I have a slight twist in the low key version of the Romney frenzy : a dog on the car roof , a 14% income tax ( and we saw his tax return ) . Compared to trumpets , they are very lightly affected. 
After the end of the tram season , Republicans' next Republican candidate must be just general psychologist and it seems like a tremendous development.
When I was visiting my cacatoke , when we took our children karasele Central Park. It's the best carousel in New York City Park and the best for three dollars without caffeine. 
Carousel horses are seen in large , medium-sized images - Scuba Baggie is watching leaks and horrible creatures - bad , and underlying bitter music is oddly fascinating.
Time spent with many New York emotions frustrating : The appearance of tall buildings starts tiring , the city's Silhouette becomes very familiar and the reality of the city does not match with the dream.
And still , 35 years later , this Swiss Cottage does not fully voice that a Swiss cottage but a large round of North London. E. Oldie Swiss Cottage is a Swiss Pub , but it is not counted. 
On the other hand , the car park of Central Park is still a strange magical experience - even two-two - year-old , one eleven - year - old and two- fourths -40 women enjoy it very much.
If someone wanted to know my opinion, I could have given Carozeel a full score , but fortunately nobody came to ask.
Instead , my readers were asked this week at the department store to evaluate my " payment experience " in less than a week before giving my credit card .
The same thing in my cafe at home , but when I own coffee shopping itself , I get an opportunity to combine an estimated 15% service fee.
This daily interaction slows down and the customer exasperates the server game where they do not need to play their character.
Deposit store salesmen got annoyed , because I paid five stars for five credit cards for my credit card.
Shefky threw a cookie cookie - "There is no confidence "
Shekki Cookie has been released from the role of the club's delegation.
Fabrizio Piccareta, former Assistant Coach , has coaching responsibilities.

Changing a coach is not an easy or beautiful task.
However, Shefka Cookie still did not trust the management of the club , so there was no alternative , Hackson commented on the club's announcement.
Piccartaa treats are valid until the end of the season.
He is responsible for the home game against HIFK tomorrow , together with another coaching team .
According to Ilta-Sanomat , the team was thrilled on Thursday.

On Saturday, Kuki and Piccata lost firmly in the inter-group match against PS Chemia.
Linda has released a young figure of Lampenius 80 - can you recognize a serious bioiling student ?
Biologist Linda Lempanias published a photo on YouTube.
Several violent scenes have been added to show a 16- year-old student of the Musician Sibylius Academy .
Lampenius himself thinks of seeing a serious young girl.
Long ago , serious , he contacted.
If you do not see the image , you can check it here.
Lampenius has previously expressed his past pictures and also talked about the painful issues.
Just a year ago , he released a pair of images in Instagram .
In the second film, he was seen 20 years ago , in the second he is now embodied , as the mother of two children.
In his caption , Lampenius considers his own growth as a person and refers to the symptoms of the disease , which he suffers as a young man.
The 0 years ago, and today ...
I'm still quite similar , that as a 26- year-old girl , but the difference is that I learned how to look at myself and how I look , Lampenius wrote.
After writing, he added the English hashtag's life , eating disorders , insecure , self - confidence , self-respect , love himself , 1996, 2016, adultism , girl , woman , old age perfect.
In the past few years, Lampianus spoke openly about his diet.
He was at the hospital at the age of 14 due to aneurysacia and orthorescence .
After a while , he had become ill in Bulimia , which could not be seen till the end of 2006 .
Healing starts slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer support , a new love was helped by the Lampenka .

Red meat , dairy products and chocolate can benefit from degenerative pain syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare on the gastrointestinal tracer.
However , recent research contradicts : Protein foods in large quantities of meat and dairy products may cause irritable bowel syndrome.
Western intestinal syndrome is a untoward disease , affecting approximately 1.3 million people in the UK and 300,000 in the UK . It reduces stomach , swelling , repeated or bloody diarrhea , loss of weight and extreme fatigue. 
Annoying bowel syndrome patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However , researchers at the University of Washington have shown that proteins help in the development of essential amino acid trifotaphan in the body of immune cells, which strengthen anticlinal tolerance. 
According to research director Marco Colón , the immune cell protects the intestine and ensures that the food does not spread harmful microbes.
Influenant tissues are balanced by cells that increase stability. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues. 
Pain can be symptom syndrome if the balance is clearly blocked.
Studies have shown that prevention - the extended immune cell has a mouse with a special bacterial intestine.
Trapfone is needed to trigger these bacterial antibodies. One of the building blocks for theTreatofofan protein. 
Professor Colina said , " We have found a connection about the development of lactobilicular reactions and infectious cells. " Lactabakillas Reuteri is a normal microbial intestine. "
" More people with diabetes were a trophone , and thus they had such immune cells " .
If the same is true for humans , a food combination rich in lactocillous rhythm and troptone can reduce intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
Prevention - Strong immune cell investigator Doctor Luisa Servants - Baron has found that , although there was such a cell of a mouse group , there was no mouse on the same mice, which was different from other groups.
He suspects that the difference is related to intestinal microbyoma , that is , general bacterial , fung, and viruses of gastrointestinal tract .
When the mouse is diagnosed with intestinal DNA , six bacterial species are found in mice with rats, but not among other mice.
When the lactobuckillous reactive bacteria is managed in the sterilized environment in the summer without germ bacteria and for which no immune cell is produced , then immune cells appear.
Researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affected the immune system. They raised Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the liquid and transferred to the fluid - without bacteria - unpleasant immune cells are detached from rats 
Immune cell resistance - enhanced in increased cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it became Trophophophan, a product of metabolic substances known as Indul 3 lactic acid.
When researchers double the amount of tropataphne in the dose of the mouse, the number of cells that increase elasticity increases by about 50 percent. Half of the amount trapataphyanera definitely , definitely half the number of cells decreases. 
Sarbhantesa - bararaganera opinion , the head of the same elasticity - strong cells are , and most of us have in our digestive bacteria in lyakatobailila riutari.
It is not yet known , lyakatophilasa ritetari trapataphona byproduct of bacteria in the same way as the mouse cells for the development. Genetic flaws related to the ruptaphone are found in patients with pain infections. 
" We must work to promote the development of such cells because they want to make the joints of the fingers pradahake bowel control " sarbhentesa - bararagana said.
"The high levels of theTreatofofen combined with the lathobacillous rutarias can promote their expansion. "
José Mourinho believes that after joining Manchester United, the Rank " Nerdy " received Nemena Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United won a " Blackjack " with an agreement with Nemena Matic , on Wednesday night, Manchester United's midfielder debut against Sampdoria. 
From Chelsea 40 million pounds maitike against United last week, before the game against Real Madrid in the Super Cup iuiephae -1 goals brought victory in Dublin. He was influenced by Paul Pogan and Andreas Perrera as a midfielder player.

Mourinho said , " He needs time, but his experience , intelligence, and thinking makes him uneasy - he has a natural feeling of football " .
" We can be more willing to do it later. "
In addition to the Matic , the starters started their game at Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku's Adhibition Stadium when Mourinho began to spin off his starting line-up for the start of the season.
Independent has published this week that Mourinho wants three new players , although the club has already earned " excited work " by acquiring three of its four best players .
" Three out of four - this is something to thank the club ," he added.
" I can get all four if I'm happy , but they did a wonderful job. "

The White House spends thousands of dollars per taxpayer
The final decision of the White House came for a $ 24,000 tax to decide on a Navy helicopter to the White House on the South Lawn for an American manufacturing incident . The information comes from military documents received by TIME . 
When the President called Green White Sikorsky VH - 3D Helicopter as Marine on its way, it was the main attraction on July 17 , 017 , in the White House , where the American Building Program was launched. 
President Donald Trump , vice president Mike Paice , and a group of White House officials know the products from all 50 states.
In addition to helicopters, Connecticut , Wisconsin and Mississippi from the fire truck myaya a silaboita includes pharkalaita trucks.
The White House Military Office is a task of a helicopter - by certain orders it was asked from the site about 36 hours before landing the " extraordinary " incident of South Lawn . This ship is clear from the HMX -1 helicopter documents. 
Commander of HMX -1 wrote to his senior officials on the day before his email event , " I want to make sure that you know about it because it is an extraordinary event that gets much visibility "
The helicopter reached the southern lord on 17th July. Seven in the morning and the incident will begin at three in the afternoon. After the field of grass was cleaned between six to nine, the helicopter will leave only the place. 
In addition , the message noted that if a helicopter flight will be delayed from the White House , other crew will require service restrictions.
At the time of the incident the original crew was in a helicopter , and when the country was in the security staff of the unit was on the helicopter.
From the documents received by TIME , it is not clear whether a second crew was needed.
The United States Hatch Act bans federal employees by using state property for political activities.
According to the document , ask the HMX-1 whether the law was violated or not .
"One of our questions was that this hasht has been violated. We have not been given a break ," the commander wrote.
The deputy Lieutenant replied " It sounds like you can participate ," .
There was an official event created in America in the White House , so it was not part of the Hatch Act.
But there are political tones in government programs.
At that time , the President lectured during the reform of health care to discuss the Senate and the discussed state rules.
Using a sea helicopter and air force for political purpose is not a new phenomenon.
The President will use them on their travels ,
But their use for photographs is unusual.
In February, the tram activities attracted attention , when Air Force organized a presidential campaign in Melbourne , Florida. His predecessor President Twitter on Twitter trimly criticized the use of aircraft 
White House Press Secretary Lindsay Waltz said , "The White House Made In America is very pleased with the event. "

On that day , helicopters ran for 11 hours in the " non - presidential support mission " .
According to the White House , any other costs not by the taxpayer.
The Sikorsky spokesman said he was not involved in organizing a helicopter demonstration in the Southern Iron of the White House.
HMX-1 's presidential duty does not have a flying account and it is difficult to evaluate the price of the event properly.
Replacement of defense during the 2017, according to the , bhieica -3 The compensation level helicopter flight time, $ 24.380 is.
According to the HMX -1 document , the White House flight from Quantco's base in Virginia and lasted for an hour.
According to the White House , the helicopter's operating costs are quite low.
" Cost calculation for taxpayers by the compensation level is confusing ," says Walters.
" An estimated level of compensation , maintenance and other so-called embedded expenses, which are taken in the annual allocation. "
The 015 In a survey conducted by research firm Rand , the compensation amount does not include the cost of staff , but the account of fuel , maintenance, and considering the cost of the contract.
During the incident , former White House press secretary Sean Spicer used to use helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production ," the speaker said.
" I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of their involvement in the security of the state's national security and millions of people are working.
And I think , like most Americans , we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans are working hard.
It is perfectly advisable to point out. " 
It was not sure whether the trump was a helicopter at the time of the incident , but at least he came to the fire truck driver's seat.
In a white house , Trump makes a joke about his own Sikorsky Flat.
" I know Sikorsky very well ," the President said. " I have three of them. "

Associated with the local rage, especially the size of the tourism presented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture says it is a " eat and escape " tour : the city ​​has only a few hours and the big crowd is thrilled through the spectacle.
VENES CITY has been quick to suppress tourists for day trips.
It is difficult to move it on the ramp road , and the fine squares will not be more of the visitors of Vinsi so full of viewers.
The hotels are forced to move further away from the historic center when they were imposed by the hotel.
The problem brought by the Venice Tourism is written by the New York Times and The Guardian.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourism volumes.

According to Luciano Borotta, the Venetian resident , if the Venetian administrative area , where Venice is located , their situation will change , they have more power to decide on their own - if there is no full autonomy.
About 20-30 million tourists visit Venice every year .
