Camille Auer wanted to fix her gender, diagnosed as a mental illness and now she is doing art on the subject - "Man should have the right to his own body"
Dozens of patient reports hang on the roof of the Academy of Fine Arts Academy.
Each one reads Camille Auer's name.
The paper tells a multi-year story of how outsiders have written up their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
He decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to share my personal histories so that the violence in the process would be visible," Auer says.
Through the process, he refers to the gender-correction process.
It is often a period of years of research that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, caregivers and doctors.
The process starts with a referral to the diagnosis of "gender identity disorder" that is being performed in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before that, he had used estrogen he ordered on the Internet and was otherwise very long in his own repair process.
She felt she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through a process of correction so that gender can also be corrected legally.
Translaki, the Act on the Promotion of Transsexual Sex (563/2002), obliges transgender people to enforce sterilization in order to obtain the right sex, for example, in the Population Register Center and Passport.
At present, each gender corrector requires psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of reproductive disability.
People have the right to decide on their own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
Transylvania has been spoken in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight observations on the law, and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the sovereignty.
The previous government of Finland prepared a law amendment with the then Social Affairs and Health Minister Susanne Huovinen.
The elections came and the True Finns rose to the government.
Now the law amendment is again stuck.
It is about internal political disputes that are not even related to this law.
"The government does not want to raise it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law," explains Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty's Department of Finland.
The front of the showroom is dominated by two major installations.
One of them is the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In Patient Reporting, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of a transplant psychologist from Auer, University Hospital of Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a report on this basis, which should be defined as a treatment for Auer's right and help.
The reality of the subject being studied seems vulnerable.
The self-perceiving self-perception appears in a border-space manner, fragmented, and the unstable features of personality are emphasized.
Auer did not recognize himself in these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear me diagnosed as a mental illness," Auer says.
An even greater shock was when Auer was not granted gender treatment.
According to the nursing staff, his or her resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was banned from his own identity.
Then on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transpole waiting room for the TV scatter.
Later on that television was born a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflects on his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone born to a woman-defined person can enlarge her breast, but diagnosing her breast removal," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are other than your birth rate determined by your gender.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one.
Sexual reparation is a lot more difficult for mental reasons than purely medical operations.
It's going to meet dozens of people who have to justify their own existence and right to their own sexual experience.
"It is crazy that people who are in need of support and assistance are denied treatment, arguing that their resources are insufficient," Auer says.
Many people in the process have psychological symptoms behind themselves: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
To this end, nursing staff may stipulate that treatment can not be initiated.
"Obstructing access to care and help can ruin an even worse situation than before it started," Auer says.
Auer's own exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: "I have had self-destructive thoughts throughout my adult life and that is what people are generally difficult to digest."
Depression has been treated with medicines and when Auer started using hormones, the feeling was relieved.
He had been able to finally say the feelings that had existed already in childhood and teenage years.
The reason why the broad jaw did not seem appropriate to the body and why the chest muscles should be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people around him who can see him.
Getting to see is a basic need.
"It is self-explanatory to talk so much by talking, dressing, using the voice, and moving," he says.
Nowadays, Auer feels he is already seen, he is a woman.
At the beginning of the process, however, the casual comments of the close associates could hurt a lot.
Most hurt when close relatives help.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they do not agree or can not internalize it," he continues.
However, all transients do not need physical changes.
They do not suffer from ecstasy or bodily disorder where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
Without the use of hormones and the long-term research process, however, there is no formal confirmation of their own sex.
"There is no medical justification for these studies," Auer says.
And that is true.
For example, in Denmark Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal gender in June 2014.
The new legislation is based on the right of self-determination regarding legal gender.
A full-time applicant submits a written application for a new personal ID, indicating that she is experiencing another sex.
After half a year's reflection period, the applicant will confirm his application in writing and the Ministry will give the applicant a new personal identity number.
This sovereignty is also required in Finland, and this requirement is also summed up by the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection.
I want to believe that art is still in the forefront and that it can lead to political changes, during which politicians have forgotten human rights.
Camille Auer's Exhibition Antiphallic Dick 4th-28th July, 2017 in the Project Room of the Academy of Fine Arts.
The Civil Rights Organization issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP Organization for African-American Citizenship has issued a travel warning about Missouri due to the state's discriminatory practices and the racist attacks that took place there.
"The Travel Declaration of the NAACP for Missouri will enter into force on 28 August 2017 and will urge African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and observe extreme caution when traveling to a state where there have been numerous controversial racial events lately", the organization's statement states.
The law recently entered into in Missouri complicates the export of discrimination cases to justice, and enforcement of the laws of the Land is disproportionately affected by minorities, according to the NAACP, which led to the issuing of travel warnings.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are stopped on skin color and beaten or killed, "NAACP Missouri chairman Rod Chapel said to Kansas City Star magazine.
"We have not previously heard about as many cases in such a short time."
The Travel Notice for Missouri is the first warning from the Organization for the United States.
The organization mentioned, for example, racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black-and-white Tory Sanders, a native of Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable conditions earlier this year, driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, Missouri police arrested him, even though he was not charged with the crime.
The travel note also referred to the statement by the Missouri Justice Minister that the police stopped the black-haired driver 75 percent more likely than white.
"The purpose of the travel bulletin is to urge people to be alert and warn their families, friends, and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People need to be prepared, for example, by including money to pay for guarantees or telling relatives that they intend to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, a hundred hostages were recorded in Missouri in 2015, or sixteen most US states.
The Travel Warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for companies to challenge their rights to housing and working relationships.
The ACLU, a civil rights defender, guaranteed by the Constitution recently issued travel warnings in Texas and Arizona after they had adopted immigration laws that oblige the police to arrest people from immigration violations, according to which this will increase racial profiling.
In general, travel alerts are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and are referring to other states. Recently, however, NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for an explanation of the CEO's supplementary pension
Mika Lintilä (center), responsible for state ownership steering, has asked Finnair for an explanation of the supplementary pension contribution received by Pekka Vauramo, Managing Director of the airline, Yle says.
According to the minister, it is contradicted by the will of the state.
The 130,000-euro supplementary pension for Vauramo was raised this week when Helsingin Sanomat news about the remuneration development of the listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti news about Vaasa's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair reported that he would abandon his supplementary pensions in 2013.
The government has ruled that no supplementary pensions are used for rewarding.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the decision of principle on owners' guidance last year.
The sanctions prompted speeches
Even a while ago it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia are moving from cold to warm.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin, who met in the industrialized countries at the G20 summit in Hamburg, seemed to be doing well together.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions signed by the United States Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday reacted bitterly in Russia.
The foremost response has been heard by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev for the time being, according to which Trump's package of forced labor means "full-fledged trade war".
Even if the Russian reactions were to be solved only by political rhetoric and excitement, the intensification of the US-Russian relationship is a fact after a short honeymoon after Trump's election.
In the United States, the execution of the mandate for Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Congress, however, accepted the bill with a remarkable consensus, but it was considerably more difficult for the president to adopt the law.
Trump criticized the law he had recently signed for "a major defect".
President Trump's mercy was probably the cause of Russia in particular, although the adoption of a law restricting his or her power rights must have been repugnant.
As is well known, there is a US investigation into Russia's possible involvement in presidential elections as well as the Trump campaign's Russian connections.
The intensification of the US-Russian relationship is a fact after a short honeymoon.
As the staff of the White House has changed dramatically and various scandalous twists have been revealed to almost update, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy will not be made in the United States under President's presidency, but despite the president.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the Russian relationship is in the United States, the same goes for the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core area in the Baltic Sea will intensify relations.
The EU has visibly raised the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk agreement.
Although the Union has so far maintained its policy in Russia at least in its entirety, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
Finland has a lot of trade with Russia like Finland, economic sanctions have been a real blow.
The effects of the United States' recent mandate are still unclear.
The EU fears that sanctions will hamper the activities of many European companies.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
Happiness in Europe has been caused by the fact that, for example, a liquid natural gas is important for the United States economy.
Trade-offs are a means of world politics to show offense.
However, economic sanctions must be very thoughtful and accurate.
Otherwise, they are more of a disadvantage than good.
Is there nothing more holy?
Trump's White House is now in the pursuit of the Statue of Liberty
Missing the sculptures is the safest sign of power change.
Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqis, along with the American soldiers, fired Saddam Hussein's statue on Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologues of the Trump administration, knew well what he was doing in a fierce debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta. The statue of liberty was attacked by Miller in a word about the president's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller did not actually criticize the statue itself.
If he had done so, he would have been captured by the huge hordes of cruise shipmasters and statues imitating the Statue of Liberty.
The subject of his attack was the importance of the statue, and in particular the fact that in 1903 the emblem of Emma Lazarus was added to the statue of the statue - 17 years after the statue was completed.
This is how Miller decided Acoste: "I do not want to go into more detail in history, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom for the whole world.
The poem was added later, and it is not included in the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller was not in itself wrong, but it's not just about history, as he himself said.
What matters is Lazarus's words, the only ones in which the state not only calls immigrants but "the poorest of the poor": "Your tired, your poor," "The Wretched Refuse of Your Teeming Shore."
Runo is now more topical than ever.
Miller did not do the literary criticism, and made it clear that "the poorest of the poor" are not welcome in Trump United States.
The controversy about the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a wider political and cultural controversy about the importance of the United States.
Lazarus's friends campaigned after his death for the poem to be attached to the statue of his statue, and they knew well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to express the connections between the French and the American republicans with a classic emblem, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem the female character is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the deported mother.
Attacking the poem to the image was an ingenious feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back to its original.
Rush Limbaugh - a cursor that can now be considered as a sign of Trump - claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not call anyone, but is the early pioneer of neoconservatives that takes the United States to fall into the darkness of the world: "Lady Liberty comes out.
He takes the freedom to fling from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not show the way to the United States. "
Rarely yes, Limbaugh was partly right.
The importance of the Statute depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the ship's deck after a long and prolonged journey.
He saw it as a protection and a better life-seeker.
His conscience is comforted by giving hope and welcoming.
And Miller and Trump in no way want to.
Their torso does not seem to be the way but the flames of hate, their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black Praises Scotland Members of the British National Team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two skots came to the UK national team
Neil Black, Chief Executive Officer of the British Athletics Association, says that 16 team members of the national team participating in the world championships are "a major boost".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected on Friday in the athletics world championships in London.
According to Black, there is "something special in Scotland," which UK athletics has to learn.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it as long as we understand what it is," says Black.
"I talked with the representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute and they thought it was about the Institute's activities.
The Scottish Athletics Association, on the other hand, believes that it is part of the alliance's activities,
and the British athletics federation believes that it is behind them.
And an ordinary street person thinks he has to do something about it.
However, something really amazing is what it is. "
Many scooters in London are serious about medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5,000-meter-long run, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as the national team captain.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly gorgeous, "says Black.
"Athletes took the opportunity proud of their achievements and strongly motivated regardless of where they live and practice.
In Eilidh's words, there was genuine feeling and passion for sport. "
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist at the Commonwealth Championship in a 400-meter hurdle race, and these are his fifth World Cup. He believes it is "incredible" that the national team has 16 scotts.
The previous record was seven years from 1983 to 2015.
Midway runner Laura Muir has been running five Great Britain and two European records during the year.
He is competing in London at 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs in London at 1,500 meters. He also has to keep an eye on: the man has an excellent season behind him, including winnings in the UK World Cup qualifiers and Anniversary Games competitions.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup qualifier, with Lee McConnell as the only scorer in the national team.
The captain of the national team says he is "extremely proud" of having so many skots, some of whom are serious about finals and medals.
"Captain access is a great honor, but more specific is because the national team members voted for the captain," Doyle says.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scotlands who came to the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved in merit athletes competing in prize pools.
Captain's speech?
I think it went well.
I was concentrating on how lucky we are when we have homework.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home crowd and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere will be astonishingly gorgeous. "
Blocking Reviewers on Facebook: Do not qualify for a public post if you can not stand for criticism
Our father knew what was bad publicity.
Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for all possible domestic politics, including his political principles.
Criticism certainly irritated,
but he did not silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is abolished, we may be led to be as silent and silent as sheep for slaughter," Washington said in 1783.
We get to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from her official Facebook page and blocked their performers.
The US Civil Rights Association challenged Hogan's law earlier this week.
His staff have to make the challenge unjustified, and the attitude was frustrating even on the web.
"What's up? This is just Facebook," many commented.
But it matters,
especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is a surprisingly popular Republican governor of the state controlled by Democrats.
He has received the second best rating among 50 governors.
Hogan is not responsive to hot crap.
He has led the state steadily and has firmly adhered to the principles.
He has also skillfully used Facebook as the main communication channel for his voters and released there an image of his cheeky face in chemotherapy.
It is therefore unnecessary and even dangerous to prevent users coming to the Facebook page of the Governor. The Governor's page is a public and official forum that his staff maintains with tax revenue.
Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse called for a governor's action in an interview with Washington Post, which she said was just about modifying comments.
Marking commentators as trunks, spammers or hateful is, however, an easy solution.
The Washington Post interviewed Hogan users blocked on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not just coaches, but teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors.
They reported that their comments were respectable, thoughtful and relevant.
The pastor quoted in his commentary the Bible, who wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland Bowie was not hostile but raised the question of hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in the comments of the Washington Post.
"I also can not accept that when more people comment on the same thing, they are considered to be somehow organized into a mass and ignored as a large group of worried citizens."
Governor staff commented on "centralized assault." Someone could call them to promote things that are important.
In Facebook's era, communication is easy to manage by blocking a reviewer or by deleting a critical comment.
Before the ages it should have sent staff to collect and burn newspapers that had published critical editorials, or to arrest and silence the protesters.
It is true, however, about the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to blame on Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have challenged him to court.
The first major decision was made last week in Virginia.
According to James C. Cacheris, Judge of the Alexandrian District Court, the Loudoun County Government violated the first addition to the US Constitution in preventing a voter on Facebook.
And the US Citizens' Rights Association met with Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin on Twitter and Facebook.
This should not be difficult.
At the time of Washington, low-priced postal charges had a similar effect to today's internet.
The number of newspapers has quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers swear Washington.
Already at that time there were trolleys.
Nicknames Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote newspaper letters in which they barked on Washington's decisions.
Appointments to the President's Office criticized Jay's agreement, the United States-Britain co-operation, trade and maritime agreement, as evidenced by the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not slow down his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of discussion are the cornerstones of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
It is advisable to stop the summer feeding of birds immediately
Samples have come in about forty places, plus online notifications of two, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Southwest Finland, but then also from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, says Senior Scientist Marja Isomursu Evia.
The green peoples have died in a trichomonosis parasite.
It is a primitive animal known as Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to strike the pigeons, and especially to the puddle.
However, in the 21st century, however, the disease was also detected by the peach kernels.
In 2009, the right thing was right.
Then tricomonous caused a major collapse in Finland's green pebble stock, after which the species's stocks have been revived.
There have been some ill-fated green peas, but at least not yet on a big scale, museum master Juha Honkala of the University of Helsinki Natural History Museum (Luomus) says.
It is pitiable that the previous epidemic of green peppers will be renewed again unless something is done.
What you have to do now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: stop eating summer food immediately.
More about this later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the Home Field Benefit at Renaissance Club
Former European top player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home-based support for the next three days as Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Rafferty, a Northern Irish racer, led last year at the neighboring Archerfield Links tournament before the final round but ultimately lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty liked the new place and acted as a messenger for the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I've been following the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event, it's full of splendor," Rafferty says.
"Players can see the field at its best, it's in great shape.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He is an avid messenger of the game and he is proud of his achievements here.
The tournament is a great show for this field. "
Englishman Eales defends championship for the first time, even though in his 32-year career he has won both the European tour and the European challenger tour.
"This really feels like a special occasion," says the player living in Southport.
"I could not defend my Extremadura Open because the tournament will not be part of this year's tour.
Here is a wonderful return.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come to mind: winning a tournament was a wonderful thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time we will always remember. "
Gary Orr returns to real action on his own ground. He went on tour after he was 50 years old.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing in the home is always more important than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed but you also feel extra pressure.
I've been enjoying playing again and playing pretty much.
I'm happy with my game so far. "
The trio will get in on the field with former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and seniors major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament includes six scotts: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament, car parking costs five pounds if the car is just a driver, and ten pounds if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds are donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
In Säkylä, there were some problems with the indoor air in the barracks
At Säkylä, Pori's brigade commemoration of the barracks, there have been no indoor air problems so far, the brigade was reported on Thursday.
Indoor air studies will continue.
The investigations started when a man who had suspended his military service for health reasons thought of his health as a weak barracks because of bad indoor air.
Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holman, Chief of Staff at the Pori brigade, said no problems were encountered in the health situation of other conscripts.
It turned out that this was an isolated case, and there were no health problems for other service providers in that unit.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to find out about this.
It is not known at this time that we have any indoor problems, Holma says.
The Brigade Bulletin tells us that because of the arrival of July, the barracks have had to move the stuff, which is why the dust may have increased momentarily.
The air may have been affected by the air, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Gold Country
Bardina Degei does not use stinging in cooking.
He uses only a few of the pots.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Pania area, located in the troubled Papua province of Indonesia. When he prepares for dinner, he usually puts a sweet potato - locally "note" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the sweet potato cooked on the stomach is eaten greedily with bare, unwashed hands.
There is no furniture in the Degei's home, he is sitting on a muddy paint, where he usually also cares for his daily work, such as laundering in the dingy water of the nearby mouth.
The toilet depot supplies a bucket in the unattended room.
Degei is the youngest of the four youngest men in her husband, and she has not been assigned to treating the fields.
Multivision is common here.
Late work can be dangerous: most of the village's men are unemployed, and many drink plenty, and the soldiers need to be taken into account.
"Nobody is afraid to walk in the village after five in the evening," Degei says.
This is a rare sighting in the Papua Highlands, the former Dutch colony, which was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. It was preceded by a controversial referendum where 1 026 village people were forced to vote in public before the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, opposed to the Dutch power, quickly turned its anger to the Jakarta government, which holds the area under strict control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from accessing it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, the eastern part of the island being part of Papua New Guinea.
The Enarotali is remote and humpbacked, and the journey begins on a one and a half hour flight from the provincial capital, Jayapura to Nabire, and continues on the stomach for a five-hour ride on a lease of a rental car.
There is no public transport here.
In the city of about 19,000 there are wooden houses surrounded by bamboo trees, with corrugated tin roofs rust colored to yellowish brown.
Only a few Indonesians have come here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papua Mee Pago family worshiped the Uga Tamee goddess.
Other changes have taken place.
"We did not have such clothes," says Degei, meaning a colorful, hand-woven wrap-around headband, a dark coat and a bright-colored sweater.
"Before we had only leaves as the cover of our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, 28% of its population live below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are Asia's highest.
But it's also Indonesia's gold.
Pania is a New Jersey-style highland with 153,000 inhabitants, only about 100 kilometers from Pania, Grasberg, the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine, owned by Freeport McMoran, based in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mining generated $ 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $ 78 billion in wood reserves.
But for the Papal people, these riches are miserable, as they represent the suppressive presence of the Indonesian strong army.
The New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid nearly $ 20 million to local military personnel and military units in 1998-2004, and paid $ 300,000 for individual officers.
Papua's demands for greater sovereignty threaten this source of income and are silenced.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 papal people since 1969 and raped, tortured and captured thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass graves in the Papua tribes' highs in the 1970s gained genocide proportions.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in peaceful demonstrations.
In Brisbane Archdiocese's report, We Will Lose Everything, from 2016, reports of the previous year's atrocities such as executions without trial, torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly popular - and relentless attacks on peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because of cases every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screw is tightened when Papua's natural resources attract divers from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants in the province, 83 percent are Christians, but the demographic structure is changing as the Indonesian populations of the islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi move the area to a better livelihood for Muslims.
The Warunian Warriors from the United States sell fried chicken and gado-gado-vegetables in peanut sauce.
Local people find it difficult to compete.
"The migrants have begun selling chicken and vegetables on the market cheaper than locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Pania and moved to the capital of the province after work.
"Local women lost their customers."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo - nicknamed Jokowi - promised in his 2014 campaign to address Papua's injustices and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 areas, including Pania, on its way to Jakarta Presidential Palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel they have been betrayed.
"Our hearts broke because we voted for Jokow in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," says You.
There was some kind of wave in the panes just two months after Jokow's October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas carols by the campfire in Enarotal on December 7, 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on the dark with motorcycles.
Depraved children told the soldiers that they should use headlamps.
Another soldier did not have a comment. According to local pastor Yavedt Tebain, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of victims and witnesses, the drunken soldiers took the children and attacked them by killing them with rifle rifles.
So one of the soldiers fired at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, collapsed as a result of ill-treatment.
A couple of hours later the building of the State Electoral Bureau was located in the fire and the next day began to happen.
About one thousand papal men - young men and women and children - met at the football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They had hunting robes for banquet halls, and they began to perform the traditional Waita dance at Papua Mee Pago, where they dance in the ring and imitate the birds singing.
Some of the protesters began to stone police and army buildings.
When I was in the mood, the soldiers in the internal radio system commanded: "If the troops make resistance more than three times, shoot them to death." This information is based on an official document from TIME that has not been disclosed to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, resident of the Kego Koto district, took the situation out of control and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot at my left wrist", she told TIME magazine a brightly painted wooden house on the porch.
Kayame still does not know who fired him, but the bullet came from the ranks of soldiers.
"Several fires were fired in the backyard."
Alfius Youwia was shot three times, and his cousin saw the firing.
"I ran to him and I assured him that he really was," she told the magazine Yohanes TIME, and he uses only one name as many Indonesians.
"So that he was dead ... I kissed him."
Papal Police Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that the police only "protected" the police station because it was an attack.
"We must defend when people threaten to kill us," Papuan police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"Then it's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The knowledge of the assassination took place in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi kept Jayapura an emotional speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and promised that Papua's violence would be affected.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that never happens again."
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he will launch human rights violations outside the legal system.
However, he began to withdraw immediately.
"Most of the offenses happened a long time ago,
1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the offenses, but that requires some processes, "he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta, June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind and said he did not intend to start investigating Papua.
"Everyone is cleared up in court," she said.
The United Nations accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity." Crimes involve the deaths of more than a thousand people in East Timor's bloody independence poll in 1999. Wiranto told TIME that 11 incidents of Papua human rights violations have already been investigated, including Pania's events.
The families of the victims of the panes are blamed in the allegations with disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times over the past three years, but things have not gone any way," Yohanes says.
"I'm already tired of this."
He tells us he still lives in fear, even though the event has been for years.
"Yes I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me. I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panicians are not afraid to discuss the event.
He says the soldiers had beaten him when he had helped bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after the burial of the victims," he says.
Shootouts are not over.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers at Pania in the neighboring area of Deiya.
One was killed and 17 were injured in the conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which originated when the leader refused to drop a man who was lost in the hospital, among the injured.
The man in charge of the hospital was Ravianus Douw, 24, who was caught in the water while he was fishing on a nearby river, and died on the way to the hospital.
The greedy villagers showed their faces at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to police, villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
According to local authorities, however, the mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire to the crowd, where one villager was killed.
"We are frightened, we are afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured being brought to the hospital.
"I've been hiding home for two days."
Deiyai's parliament has called for shots to be fired by police officers and the withdrawal of a moving police unit from the area.
Pania has always been a problem in the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development fueled dissatisfaction with the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes living on the lush midships of Papua.
Many have joined the Papacy Liberation Movement (OPM), the Rebel Army, which claims to defend the rights of Papal people by occasional attacks and kidnapping of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the riot by arrested and arbitrarily imprisoned thousands of people in Pania for the "protection of national sovereignty".
Some of the detainees will never return.
Among Pan-Egyptians, Pania is known as a "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty fueled dissatisfaction.
There is only a small amount of rice in the Enarotal, and it's too expensive for local people,
such as bread.
People grow their own food: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Cultivation is the work of women, and one woman can be responsible for four or five sweet potatoes.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the remainder is sold on the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the differences in livelihoods between locals and migrants have increased and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened to Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs, and usually go local to better educated and wealthier migrants.
Only a few clerics have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of Pania's tribal council.
Outstanding Papua remains in the world for little attention.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basch Longchamp were expelled from Papua even though they were granted a rare license. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
Phelim Kinen, Asia's Deputy Director for Human Rights Watch, said Jokowi did not keep his promises. He did not increase transparency and did not promote development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
"Indonesian troubled eastern provinces, Papua and Western Papua, have new risks: refusing to enter the visa and entering the black list," China said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is only pressed by the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua's "numerous and widespread violations," including Pania's shooting firing.
These states have traditionally supported the Papua Liberation movement.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with press freedom, so it would be difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations".
The locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When the official Dutch delegation led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baari visited Jayapura on May 4, 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says an anonymous, stagnant source of the meeting.
Indonesia has presidential elections in 2019, but clerics say they are no longer likely to vote for Jokow.
"Jokowi means good, but around him there are people who are tired of Pania's shooting firing," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Paninians: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army and in poverty, virtually without health care and educational opportunities.
According to Gobai, Panagiotians, like other papal people, regard the sounds they give to Jokow as a "debt" that has to be repaid.
"They do not want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the shooting in Paniai once again demonstrated the resistance symbolically: they buried one of the victims at the police station and the army's office on the opposite side.
They know they may never get the right, but at least they will not let the responsible ones forget their crimes.
"My family was killed," Yacobus says in the head.
"What else could we do?"
Dereck Chisora barks on canceling Robert Helenius's replay: "Even my own fans do not want to see"
The heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were supposed to be shot on May 27 at Hartwall Arena.
However, the match was canceled for commercial reasons.
Chisora walks in the recent interview with IFL TV as a reason for flushing the replay of the replay completely to Helenius's shoulders.
I played in Finland flop, but it was not my fault.
I do not live in Finland, I do not want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans do not want to see him fit because he's naughty, Chisora says.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial point of view.
The re-sale ticket sales went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanomat in May that the match was moved to the fall.
It has not been anything new to match.
However, Chisora is no longer a disaster.
It would probably have been a good match to quit in any case after Chisora's illness.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I was awake to the hard pains.
My tumble was exploding.
In the hospital I was told that I had to cut, Chisora says.
Brits say they are currently in a 45% condition.
He does not think of a re-match with Helenius, but is in the pursuit of Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a defeat at Whytelle in December.
The fire captured the Torch skyscraper in Dubai
Flames captured the world's tallest residential building in Dubai on Friday, with hundreds of residents fleeing from a 337-meter-high 79-storey building.
This was already another fire within two years of a building whose name happens to be Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied and no one was known to be injured. The reason for the fire did not have the impression immediately after the event.
"We were sleeping and woke up with the fire alarm and the humor of humans.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes, "a resident of George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai rescue authorities, the firefighters got the fire shut off at four o'clock in the morning and left the building cool.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case may raise questions about the security of materials used on the outside of high buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Torch Building Board commissioned a study to find out that most of the damage was to the façade curtain and insulation boards.
In Britain, the police believe that the London Grenfell Tower insulation and cladding plates could contribute to the rapid advance of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
From the Joensuu parking lot, a moped was stolen during the night
The mosaic was stolen from Joensuu's parking lot at 2 pm and 5 am on Wednesday.
Mopo disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.

In the United States, more than 20 percent of air passengers take prohibited articles on the aircraft, revealing a survey
A survey conducted by air travelers reveals that over 20% of passengers in the United States had conscientiously or unknowingly taken the prohibited articles past the US TSA checkpoints. At least six percent of the passengers had knives or other objects with blades they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent said that they had only learned afterwards that they had been carrying weapons, ammunition or explosives in error.
More than a thousand passengers answered the questionnaire and was implemented by the Stratos Jet Charters, which also reveals that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules.
19.7 percent of the conscientiously violating TSA rules were Y-generation and less than 15 percent belonged to the X-Generation.
Most commonly, the rules were violated by bringing food and liquids to the airplane.
More than three percent admitted knowingly crafted objects with blades to the aircraft, and 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men said they consciously brought the banned drugs to the aircraft.
The questionnaire was attended by travelers from all over the United States. The survey company wanted to find out how many people had accidentally exported the smuggling goods past the security check and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that most travelers are also taking smuggling goods most likely past security checks - deliberately or unknowingly.
But as the survey company notes, TSA's instructions are quite complicated and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids they can take on an airplane and how much.
It is no surprise, therefore, that most TSA seizures are liquids.
For some time, she also thought she could not take the books on the airplane.
Fluids can be exported to domestic flights but not for international flights.
US Environmental Protection Director Scott Pruitt rolled his decision to delay decisions taken in the Obama administration to reduce emissions
The day after the 15 States had challenged the US Environmental Protection Agency's EPA director Scott Pruitt, Pruitt canceled his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smog emissions during the Obama administration.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he leads takes better account of the needs of the state's environmental decision-makers.
Pruitt did not even mention a lawsuit against his earlier decision at the federal appeal court.
States should begin to comply with the level of ground-level ozone in 2015 from 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he will move the implementation of the decisions forward for a year, so that his office will have more time to get acquainted with the plan because the agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt was a Public Prosecutor of the State of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump named him the EPA leader, and Pruitt is known as an opposing stricter environmental regulation.
Following its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against chemical industry and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback for Pruitt's plan to mitigate the provisions.
Last May, the federal appeals court in Washington issued a decision that the EPA Director exceeded his mandate to try to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's decision on oil and gas companies, and forced the companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement on Wednesday night, Pruitt argued that his full-fledged translation of ozone provisions only strengthens EPA cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements in line with the timetable.
"In previous administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with deadlines, and then expected that activist groups and others would challenge it to reach agreement on timetables," Pruitt said in his previous work at the Environmental Agency's law more than ten times.
"We do not believe in legal regimes and we are serious about taking deadlines.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the Finnish power to do so. "
However, the EPA statement stated that Pruitt could continue to use "powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legitimate powers" to ensure that the provisions are "justified and based on the best available information".
Republicans are pushing for greater change in ozone regulations at the congress.
The bill passed last month aims to delay implementation of 2015 decisions for at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the Senate.
The prosecutor of New York State State Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, lead by the EPA this week, has condemned the group's intention to continue the pressure.
"EPA's change of mind as a result of our actions is a major gain for those 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are exposed in their communities to the direct impact of smoke smokescreen," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the claim was brought together in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Earth's ozone is generated when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause severe respiratory problems for vulnerable groups of people and is also part of the premature deaths of thousands of people each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt's surprising reversal.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required to make the same guy in the respiratory air use common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of Biodiversity Center.
"We must fight again against the Trump administration, because its ideological goal is to act on the basis of polluters and other groups that have their own interests."
Superstars manufacturer coming into the street masks - "takes place in Ferrari's style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars as it strives to hold on to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will take place in Ferrari's style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said plans for a press conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer introduces its new five-year plan, Automotive News reports.
All Eastern Savo measles cases of the same virus type
Rantasalmi's measles infection is the same virus type as previous cases in East Savo, informs THL.
The laboratory for virology at the National Institute for Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that East Savo's fifth measles infection is the same virus strain with earlier infections.
THL has ensured that the Malaysian measles infection confirmed by a Baltic people on Friday 28 July is of the same type of virus as previous cases of Eastern Savo.
Based on this information, all infections found in Eastern Savo are related to the first measles in June.
The news is good because it means we have not come up with other types of measles virus.
It is possible, however, that new infections may emerge until the middle of August, and the epidemic is not over yet, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, MD, responsible for infectious diseases at SOSP.
No new cases of measles or their suspicions have emerged after the fifth confirmed case.
Still, it is important that everyone cares about the timelyness of their vaccine protection, Erkkilä reminds us.

Finland is preparing for a permission to make a kilowatt
The soup of the pontoon was not even considered for legalization.
The underlying reason is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, along with the wine.
Making a kite at home is legal next year, but legalizing the spoon is not even considered.
The kiln is made by fermentation, but the distillation is distilled.
The underlying reason for distillation is that the process produces methanol, which is poisonous, along with the wine.
There has been no political will to regulate the scourge of jokes to everyman's right, says Ismo Tuominen, Counselor of Social Affairs and Health, commenting.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of the spit was not considered legalized.
The matter was also not brought to the political table.
There was no debate about the liberalization of distillation, states Outi Mäkelä, Member of the Parliament (Kok.).
He is in the negotiating corps of the parliamentary groups of government parties, who took up the reform of the Alcohol Act.
The permission to distil at home can not continue to be granted even on application.
Commercial manufacturing is also subject to license.
Tuominen tells us that the home-making of alcoholic beverages is a simple rule: alcohol can be made at home by fermentation.
This means that, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can also make your home legally clean.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements of flavor and flavor and makes it possible to make a kilt, Mäkelä refines.
Production must still take place in such a way that the raw materials or the flavorings and flavorings that come into contact with the fermentation are clearly visible in drinking.
According to the new law, drinks can be made to themselves as much as they want, and self-made alcohol can be given as a gift.
You still can not sell it for sale.
Killing is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A bigger change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now being examined by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be processed by Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law comes into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if parliament had already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to hospital by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius suffered from chest pain in a South African hospital due to suspected heart attacks.
Pistorius has already got out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius sues the jail sentence at Atteridgeville Prison.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital in the afternoon.
The prison's spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to hospital for examinations.
The spy spokesman for the Pistori family told reporters that the former top athlete is in good shape.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced the six-point Paralympic gold medalist to six years in jail for murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Teleconferenced phone conversations reveal Trump has pushed Mexico to build a border wall
Leaks to the Washington Post have been broadcasted by telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
In a telephone conversation on January 27, 2017, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop public speaking about not planning to pay for the proposed brigade.
The President of the United States called Nothing to say that he had been banging the wall project publicly. "You can not say so to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched its presidential campaign promising to build a wall at the southern edge of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published an announcement on Trump's first call to Malcolm Turnbull, Australian Prime Minister, during which a tense exchange of words took place.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on the way to Australia is "ridiculous", "disgusting" and "silly." According to Trump, the deal negotiated in Obama's season would make him look like an idiot because he had proposed a ban on refugee settlements in the United States.
Trump quit by saying to Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call all day".
Georgian massacre: Activists reinvent racist lynching right in the hope
The Ford Mercury car will overtake the crowd in the small town of Monroe in rural Georgia and continue on to the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
The car has four black-haired passengers and a white driver. Four armed men block the road before the car arrives to the bridge.
The leader of the squad, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and rolls through the windshield.
The passengers are frightened.
"Roger, n --- u!" The man stumbles.
"Get out of the car!"
Cries break silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
This shocking event is, fortunately, merely a re-launch, which was presented on 22.7.2017.
The sighs of shock, however, are real, as the hang of the loop is tied to the "Roger" neck.
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to re-stage the events of 1946. At that time Ku Klux Klan plucked two black couples Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
Nobody has been prosecuted for murder.
"It is confusing that no one has been arrested during these years - even though the murderers live among us and many have to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps re-surrender arrangements.
"It is the shame of history, but above all it is a burden that weighs our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian Congressman.
For him, the reenactment is a startling call to action, and it also reminds Monroe's residents that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want the culprits to come to justice, and we want things to be finally completed, and we want to recover from grief and reconciliation, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can not recover and make reconciliation before we get justice."
The Death Knight conceals the body of the dead victim of Georgian massacre on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI documents received by NBC news, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts were suspected of lynch.
However, no one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, according to activists, the motives of lynching have always been known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the black people of Georgia were given the highest court decision to vote for the first time in the presidential election. The Supreme Court issued its ruling in April and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, an incident occurred during the election, where Roger Malcom, black-haired runner-up, stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, who was apparently dealing with Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, the city was rumored that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was waiting for this baby.
According to the FBI, the influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid on July 25, 1946 Malcom's $ 600 warrant against which he was released from prison.
At home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their cars before Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and organized murders," the FBI report states.
"It is also apparent that there was conspiracy between the state and the local authorities, involving authorities in the murders and destroying the evidence and not revealing the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks expresses the utmost concern.
"It was a vote of suicide," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to tell the black people that they would do the same if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has guided the reprisal of Georgian massacre for almost a decade.
The presentation is extremely realistic and captivating, it is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe in the United States that has disappeared today.
It's hard to look at the show but it's even harder to look at what Greenen is supposed to do.
"We do not want to talk about lynch, because we have to face our own dark side," says the pilot.
"But I can not create a relationship with you if you do not hear me or you do not want to hear what I have to experience."
This year's show work began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors - a dozen blacks and twenty white - gathered to listen to Green's routinely summarized presentation.
Wade Marbaugh works as Green's Assistant Director.
He has resumed local Ku Klux Klan leadership for years, but the role is always as difficult and obnoxious.
"There's a dirty feeling because I'm not my own," Marbaugh says.
"It is important, however, that this side of history is also kept on display so it will never happen again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, are trained in turn.
The show begins with a scene in which Malcom screams and punches Hester and is furious that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothy.
"Did not you hear me? I told you to leave my mail, n --- u!"
Rascona or Hester answers.
Then there is a beating.
And then all (at least all black-and-white Actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughs harder.
"What ?!" Rascona asks.
She is confused.
"Is it accidentally too strong?" He asks.
"No," Greene snorts.
"I just do not think the whites used the word n-u at that time."
"So," another black-and-white actress confirms.
"It's slang. You have to use a longer version."
The subject of the presentation is uncomfortable, but the room is dominated by a friend.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for a presentation, they want to honor the memory of those killed.
The scene starts from the beginning.
Now Rasconan's words are scratching.
No one laughs.
The retraining ends quickly and violently.
Awkwardness, shots - and silence.
A woman dressed in black funeral dress stands beside the corpses and sings the Strange Fruit song by Billie Holiday.
His voice breaks in every other word.
A few dozen meters away, fifty viewers wipe off their eyes with sweat and tears.
Nearly half of the audience is black and half of Caucasian.
There is a couple who have come to see a show of Ithaca in New York, but most are local.
They have visited Brooks' guidance in the tombs of the victims in Georgia's humidity.
The murders have changed from story to story, the atmosphere at the venue is heavy.
After the songwriting, Greene invites the crowd to check the bodies.
Children squat to see the flood and immobile bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutter as if to remind himself.
Within a few minutes Greene will thank the audience.
Actors who are lynched show off their lines and wipe the tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, a man from the local Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough show.
"No problem," the woman involved in the presentation comforted.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason. "
Later, the audience and Actors meet for a joint dinner.
A white couple arriving from Altanza is busy discussing the show with the black-and-white couple she has just met.
It is difficult for Denise Duplinskin to find words when describing the feelings that the performance is about.
"It's hard to listen to horny words and watch the terrible acts that people say and do that look like you - just because they look the same as you do," he says.
"For me, the show found that lynch is still happening," he added, "they are just called arrest."
On the other side of the room, Brooks remembers the development of civic rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he has already begun planning next year's presentation.
"Recapture is a powerful experience because it describes the horizons we are experiencing, but it is also an educational experience," says Brooks.
"The message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it. "
Growing vegetables in stores will worsen: By doing so, removing "extra parts" really saves
Is it permissible to remove the cauliflower leaves already in the store before weighing?
How about taking a big hat out of pineapple - does it even matter how much?
The responses share strong opinions: for one it is a sign of the utterance of the utmost, while others do not want to pay for those parts of the vegetable that they do not use and who, however, go home in the trash.
The phenomenon is recognized in stores.
For example, in the vegetable department of K-Citymarket, Ruoholahti, in Helsinki, there are cardboard boxes, because many rewind, for example, the leaves of cauliflower.
From the box, the leaves are marketed in bio-waste.
According to the news published by Taloussan, the smelling of vegetables on the verge of smelling merchants.
But how much excess removal of vegetable extracts before weighing really saves you money?
How significant is the remedy mode really?
We Women tested how the price changes when pineapple, artichoke, mushroom, broccoli, and cauliflower take the leaves or strains off.
Cauliflower: The price of cauliflower for € 2.10 was € 1.80, with the bark removed from the leaves.
Pineapple: The price of whole pineapple paid for EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its stock faded away.
Latvian artichokes: The price of EUR 2.60 was EUR 2.40 when the Short Range was cut off.
Mushrooms: Two cuddly gourds cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: Medium broccoli cost 1 euro and without strain 80 cents.
The end result: If leaves and strains are pulled out, save a few tens of centimeters at one of the best vegetables.
As a percentage of vegetables, prices fell by as much as 20 per cent.
Thus, these purchases would have saved a total of 1.20 euros!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - the brass star signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, according to AFP.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a € 222 million outlay for FC Barcelona in football in the Spanish league.
A Huge $ 222 million transfer is the biggest in football history.
Earlier this was a record for Manchester United, which paid last year € 105 million for the French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league barred the move earlier Thursday, when it rejected the first payment transaction for Neymar's representatives.
According to the rules of the league, the collecting club can not pay the outright price directly to the seller, but the player has to buy his contract out, which is by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and its agents who provided the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will be presented to a possible new home crowd at PSG's opening season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa examines the details
Barcelona also reported in its announcement that it would provide information on the payment to the European Football Association Ufa, so that the federation could determine the disciplinary action that may be caused by the case.
Among other things, the President of the Spanish League, Javier Tebas, has suspected that PSG has violated Uefa's financial fair play rules in his money.
Uefa can be penalized for a follow-up that makes over three years worth over € 30 million in losses.
According to Uefa, Neymar's transfer does not automatically break its financial spree.
Neymar's transfer to PSG affects the club's economy for several years, but the effect can not be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG could sell a large number of players with substantial sums, Ufa was informed.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatar Sports Investment company in Qatar.
The club is chaired by a former tennis professional from Qatar, Nasser al-Khelaifi.

Austin, 21, received brilliant flash lightning - a flash was stored at the airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing ordinary work on the airplane at the Southwest Florida International Airport with a couple of co-workers when suddenly a raindrop sky hit the lightning plane.
The power of the blast threw the machine near the wing of Dunn.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had a third degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and said his brother got an electric shock and he's in the hospital.
I asked if he was alive, Austin sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to burns, he had muscle damage and brain drain.
Experience was hard for the whole family.
There is no such thing to expect.
It is traumatizing for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport representative, the security risk warning system was in place at the time of the case and the Carrier itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3,000 jobs and revives business by cutting dividends
The British training group Pearson announced on Friday that it will cut 3,000 jobs and cut 72% dividend when initiating a new restructuring program in response to pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job reductions will be made mainly at the end of 2018 and early 2019. The company already reduced 4,000 jobs in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it will cut back costs by 300 million pounds in May as part of its third savings program aimed at reviving a weakened business as a result of rapid digitization.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in Penguin's Random House to its partner, Bertelsmann, who announced that it would remain unchanged for the current year, with net sales rising by 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Kill a conspiracy in Kabul: The NATO soldier died in a suicide attack
A suicide bomber struck a militia in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul. According to authorities, the blast killed a NATO soldier and several others were injured.
According to NATO statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local information, three civilians also died in the Kabul Qarabagh area.
The explosion is the latest violent blow in Afghanistan this month. On Tuesday, 30 people were killed in a mosque in an explosion in Herat.
On Monday, two people died in suicide bombing at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, a Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint patrol of the NATO and Afghan Army was forced into an attack by a "self-contained explosive device".
The statement said that all the injured were stable and were dealt with at the US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabag are a major concern for the NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1 662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, including 20 percent in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide bombing in Kabul, a region where predominantly Shiites live.
The Taliban announced that it was behind the blow.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people in the center of Kabul died in a bomb attack that was the country's most devastating militant group after the US-led troops invaded the Taliban in 2001.
Violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether to send more troops to the United States to help the local army and police.
According to correspondents, recent suicide attacks in Kabul have also seriously weakened people's trust in the government, its policies, and especially President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA defeats its decision to postpone the implementation of smoke flavorings
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decides to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smog emissions during the Obama administration, the day after the 15 States had challenged the agency's law.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called "ozone definitions" of 2015 on late Wednesday, according to the agency. The decision indicates its commitment to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the Länder," said Scott Pruitt, Director of the Agency.
Pruitt announced in June the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone depletion by one year to October 2018. According to the definitions, smog contamination is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution should be reduced in accordance with more stringent air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the Office filed a lawsuit against 15 state-controlled states, including the District of Columbia, for which it was illegal to postpone the execution.
The administration of President Donald Trump has sought ways to mitigate the environmental provisions of Barack Obama, according to Trump, that measures are part of a broader economic growth program.
Trump's actions have been opposed by democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increasing emissions.
According to EPA websites, inhalation of ozone-containing air "can impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a person belonging to the most famous leaders also sent bombs to Sydney.
According to suspicions, the bomb was supposed to be put on air on July 15, but the company was suspended before security checks.
The police will not tell you why the company was interrupted.
Another suspect terrorist plan was to build a poisonous colorless gas separator and take the device to the top of a public place, such as public transport.
Australian Federal Deputy Commander Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to the suspected terrorist plans, four men were detained in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but her examinations will continue.
Neste CEO: Renewable fuels worked well
Oil Refinery Neste's earnings before taxes fell, but hit forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company made a good result in petroleum products, sales of renewable products rose to record levels and the Marketing & Services segment's operating profit was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was boosted by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax.
According to Lievo, the operating profit of renewable products remained good this year, thanks to higher sales volumes and a more favorable market, even though tax breaks ended.
Our strategy is proceeding well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects, and we will finish the strategic investments we announced earlier in 2017, Lievonen said in a press release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatshenko discuss possible matches at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomatshenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on the collision course for the 66.7-kilos of the most exciting boxing match in the foreseeable future, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports hall in Los Angeles, until the WBC's invincible lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked through the hallway to greet Lomatshenko, the WBO's top featherweight champion.
Garcia won the former four-weight class champion Adrien Broner with unanimous decision on Saturday, after which Garcia and Lomatshenko have been among the top five in the ranking of different weight classes on a comparative list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and asked, "How are you doing, master?
Good luck! "
Lomatshenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on seven Saturdays.
As the duo posed for photographers, Lomatšenko's manager Egis Klimas pointed out that the match between men would be "perfect in size".
"I'm a feathered feather," Garcia recalled.
"I moved the set up to [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not so big.
I'm small in size to 63.5 kg.
I want to go back to the light series.
He has to get into the lightweight [61.2 kg], then we can take it off.
Our fans hope.
To fulfill their wishes. "
Lomatshenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this match."
Klimas asked if the match should be arranged on the payment channel, which is part of his strategy for Lomatšenko, according to which Lomatshenko will debut in the lightweight series later this year, and will secure the Garcia next season (37-0, 30 knockout), Garcia is interested to face the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell.
"The match could be on the payment channel as fans have asked for it," Garcia said, and later announced she was ready to match the channel that offered the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else wakes up so much attention.
It's OK for me to reach an agreement ... "
Garcia said he liked Lomatshenko as an "incredible wrestler," and may want to go to watch a Saturday match.
Lomatshenko interrupted Garcia's lurking and said that this Riverside champion of three weight classes looked "really slow, sorry, Mike ... but you needed it to knock."
Garcia said she was focusing first on the hit force and then on the boxing.
The men said they knew that the match between them was going to get stronger.
"This is the match that is expected.
No other match wakes up so much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this story, "Garcia said.
Lomatshenko said he was expecting to meet with the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It will be a great match. "
Average salary of 5,300 euros, training what happens - the situation of investment advice was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advisory has been much discussed lately.
Most recently, Helsingin Sanomat told Ritva, 68, to whom the Bankruptcy Investment Adviser talked about a full-blown investment product at Selling.
Investment advisers and various rules on the sale of investment products will tighten at the beginning of next year.
The tightening is based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will be applied from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisers and investment product employees is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not specify competence requirements.
The Finance Department (FA) itself recommends that investment service employees perform their own APV1 or APV2 qualifications.
The finance sector has authorized the organization of qualifications for the APV Investments Certificates Ltd, which is part of the degree group of experts of the Financial Supervisory Authority (FIVA), universities and industry.
The degrees are in the range of 12 to 15 credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, ie Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides business management services.
On its website, it is reported that, generally speaking, both exams are "quite extensive in terms of requirements".
The study material for the degrees includes 10-15 books and a number of other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, Managing Director of APV Investment Investments Oy, says that the penetration rate of the exams is roughly estimated at about 70.
Most of the staff of the largest banks have completed either the APV1 or APV2 qualification, since their execution is compulsory according to the company's own rules.
Then there are smaller brokers who do not mention the names whose staff is influencing the graduation degree, says Savikko.
According to him, such brokerage firms are "a few".
According to Savikko, APV1 graduates have completed between 13,000 and 14,000 people since 2000 and require more than 3,000 APV2 qualifications for investment advisers.
Some brokerage firms consider the completion of a degree as an advantage.
Many other industries have considerably more stringent skills requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation for the financial sector requires APV qualifications, because then the expertise in the field of investment is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn a large number of thousands of euros per month, including commissions, fringe benefits and performance bonuses.
The average earnings of regular monthly working payers are around EUR 5,300.
The average number of men in charge is over 5,900 euros per month and women over 4,500 euros a month.
The tenth most earning earns an average of around € 8,100.
The tens of the most talented men earn more than 9,000 euros a month or more, one-tenth of the most earning women earn 6,400 euros or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be issued by a licensed company.
Until now, the level of employee and job level has been trusted in self-regulation.
According to Fiva, the audit carried out individual cases where the investment adviser did not have the skills and competence of the Investment Adviser to provide sufficient advice.
As a seller of investment products, you can also act in principle, even if your skills and qualifications are on a low level.
From this point of view, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other industries have considerably more stringent skills requirements, says Savikko.
According to Savikko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened by the new MiFID II.
It requires that every company is responsible for ensuring that the investment services personnel are sufficiently skilled.
Financial oversight, on the other hand, will have the power to impose what to know.
Fua's Market Supervisor Marko Hovi says that one of the clear changes to the current one is a regulation on the requirements for know-how and experience of sales advisers and investment product sellers.
According to Hov, the new requirements apply to both the own staff of investment firms and the tied agents who sell products on behalf of one company.
Hovi says that according to the government's proposal by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will be given the power to impose competence and experience.
What exactly they are, will be decided in the coming autumn.
In the future, the company will also need to provide the necessary training and, where appropriate, follow-up and further training.
All this must be documented, and the company has this obligation to show that this has also been done.
Hovi explains that in practice, for example, the company has to chart the personnel's job descriptions on an individual level.
There will certainly be different levels of demand depending on whether it is investment advice or sales of products.
According to Hov, new is also the requirement to work with a more experienced one, if the expertise or experience is not at a sufficient level.
That is, if a company hires a new employee who does not exactly meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a certain time criterion.
According to Hov, the change will make the rules tighten and become more concrete.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
Photo: 787 Dreamliner passenger "drew" a giant plane on the US
The plane flying over the aircraft was plotted over the US on Flightradar24's service.
The flight was conducted on Thursday 787 on Dreamliner, which tested Boeing's airborne Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane departing from the seaside flew for 18 hours and 1 minute at a distance of 15,700 miles, which is longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in the world.

It flew across 17 provinces.
Imatra's persevering beach-folk schools do not spot the rain or sun-roast - Iines Kaikkonen Polski with the help of a bathing stove
Iines Kaikkonen walked in good speed, followed by Taina Itkonen.
Imatra's coastal school schools rotate in Liette and Lempukka this and next week.
Even though it rains and then shines again, young swimmers will not be in the mood, says Taina Itkonen, a swimming school leader.
In this week's swimwear camps, a total of 13 kids will swim in sports, next week, a dozen.
The number of children in the coming week was influenced by the fact that a school and an owl will now start, according to Itkonen.
The Imatra Village School is organized jointly by the Sports Combine project and the city of Imatra.
On Thursday, the beach at Liette was a nice mood.
The sun was shining and the young swimming schoolworkers were training on the surface to stay with swimming sticks, some already out.
Smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines From Anything, 5, first thought the deeper into the water.
Taina Itkonen encouraged him, however, to drift towards the beach.
It's fine!
Iines Kaikkonen told reporters that she had been swimming much this summer.
The sloping beach is good for him.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, he practiced swimwear with swimwear Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too will be happy with today's achievements, swimming praise praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, wanted another water tank.
Following her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, swimming from the beach, Ilona Villberg keeps the beach school as a good start for swimming.
Although the weather has been what happens, Anna has been willing to go here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Swimmers packed on the pier.
The nurses did not rush with the frog found in the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the dock, nudged fruit and roasted days.
In the water already the teaching continued, but there was no hurry at the dock.
That's when it's not summer.
The unknown soldier sells barges - "Here is such a unifying story"
It's all about it.
Sinituote, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched a Unknown Soldier product series a couple of days ago.
So, brushes and laundry baskets - as well as a "toilet brush with a brush brush".
An unknown soldier refers to the premiere of the film and the marketing of the movie this fall.
Yet there is something special in the combination and the products have been exposed in social media: When do the unknown sanitary napkins come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Deputy CEO of Sinituotteen, say?
We are a film partner.
We're supporting this movie, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cultural film, Määttä says.
According to him, the products will be specially crafted, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Is not this a little funny - often when you think that the products and related stories have something in common?
Yes, it is such a story that we are a Finnish player and these are Finnish products, "says Määttä.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are endorsed by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not a host for military culture, Määttä points out.
Other business partners in the Unknown Soldier movie include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, for example, Hartwall vichy, which is named Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela, has been introduced to the market.
The unknown journalist's products were already recorded by the newspaper publisher Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and bells are also available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the movie, so the sequel is still in progress.
Unknown partners have not yet revealed their war products such as Valio, Jalostaja, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
The new results of the Swedish tests for the asylum seekers were published
The latest results of the medical tests on Swedish asylum seekers have been published. The results of the new test methods show that over 80 percent of those tested were over 18 years of age, but not all tests are reliable.
The Swedish National Forensic Office started testing earlier this year.
A new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticized for failing to determine the actual age of applicants claiming to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has so far made 6,880 tests and the Office of Forensic Medicine has now announced the results of 2,481 tests, which were conducted between mid-March and late July 2017.
The 80 per cent of the 2002 asylum seekers tested were found to be over the age of 18. In addition, the Forensic Medicine Agency identified 25 cases of "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under 18 years of age".
Tests were only conducted in cases where there was reason to suspect the applicant's age.
Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Office says that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly uniform, and there are no big differences between the previous months," he told The Local.
Although a large number of applicants were found to be over the age of 18, it does not necessarily mean that applicants have lied to their age.
In May, the agency announced the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases there were "indications that 18 years of age or older should be investigated".
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it appeared that in 243 cases, the applicant had been openly told that he would meet this year for 18 years.
The medical age evaluation method used in the tests uses x-ray imaging of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of the knee joint, followed by dentists and radiologists to analyze the images, and the method has also been criticized.
One of the skeptics is the Endocrinologist of the Karolinian Institute Claude Marcus, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans, and can be used to determine whether a person has become puberty earlier or later.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I think the method used is not the right one.
Determining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can not determine age, we should not pretend we can do it, "he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson's Office of the Judiciary has called for the accuracy of the tests: "Generally speaking, the risk of determining a child for an adult is small.
The risk is greatest in the situation where the tester will soon reach 18 years, and then the risk is about 10 percent. "
Ilonen plunged 30 seats in Scotland
Five over par results in the third round spent Mikko Ilosen 30 points with the score flush down at the European Golf Tournament in Scotland.
Ilonen left the 11th place on Saturday night, but found the end of the round to divide the place 41.
Iloselle was in a difficult track with three dungeons, one double bed.
It was also difficult for others.
Englishman Ian Poulter rose to split the top spot in one of the under-rounds, although he said that he was busy working on an umbrella.
Keli was raw, but I hung up and finally the day was good, Poulter tuumi.
He shares his top compatriot with Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
The governor of West Virginia will change the party
Democratic governor of Western Virginia Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening that Trump's campaign event would change the party.
"Democrats simply rejected me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflection ... Today I tell the West Virginia that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The audience broke out for applause.
"To become a member of the Republican Party Registered Tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach I would say to you that it is time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that a major announcement will be made in the West Virginia campaign event.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherits a mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
His property is worth about $ 1.59 billion.
On Thursday night, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued an opinion saying that "the governorship of Justice's party is again a new blow to a democratic party that will rather build barriers than better America".
"Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before, and in that context, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership and can not find a positive message that unites people," Ronna McDaniel, RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in CBS's statement.
Flashes shed damage - from Thursday coming up even during the very thunderstorm of summer
Thunderstorms will be added to Southern Finland later this week.
Over the past week, it has sunk particularly in the central and northern parts of the country and in the Southwest Finland area.
The night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes ignited several fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may become a thunderstorm in the summer.
The thunderstorms have finally found Finland too.
During the past week, it has exploded especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the Southwest Finland area.
At the table, the lightning struck the electric block of a row house causing a small fire.
The rescue service was notified of the fire about a quarter to Wednesday midnight.
The electric center was located in the sauna area at the end of the row house.
The Rescue Department discharged the roof and wall to find the fire clay and shut down the fire.
A total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
At the glimmer of light, the flash lighted off the building block at Harjulantie before midnight.
At the time of the rescue service, the building was already in full fire, and the rescue service could not but prevent the spread of the fire.
An outbuilding of about fifty square meters burned to the ground.
In Kuopio direction, Rääkkylä again hit the house.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flashing lightning strike.
The rescue service was there to check the case, but this time the lightning did not get a fire - only a few fuses fell.
In traffic, the thunderstorm caused problems on the train line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when a lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
Information on the bug was received on Thursday morning between eight and nine, after which the trains in that interval were replaced by buses.
The problem was only corrected shortly before 5pm.
Since then, train traffic has been able to continue normally even with a thunderstorm.
Flashes have sown destruction across Finland.
However, flashlight has been relatively low this summer.
This summer's thunderstorms have been quite dead! "Said Meteorologist Jari Tuovinen.
Wednesday and Thursday thunderstorms have been mostly moderate in intensity, but due to the low light bulb of the summer, it also seems to many to be strong.
This might seem like a really heavy thunderstorm, but that's what it is since the thunderstorms this summer, "says Tuovinen.
On Wednesday, land reclamations broke out 1 700 times and Thursday had potentials even during the toughest day of the summer: around 16 o'clock in the plaque there were 1,790 terrain slopes.
If the lightning continues even at the beginning, more than two millennia lightning can be achieved, Tuovinen predicts.
The record record of the thunderstorm was felt in 2015, when the year's lightning amount was about 30,000.
By Wednesday the number of flashes this year had increased to 18,386 in salamander.
So it is still worthwhile to let this year not break the "record" of two years ago.
However, the Ukkoskiri can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, air is still warm and humid during the rest of the week on Finland, which is a favorable environment for thunderstorms.
The main thrust of the thunderstorms will take place on Saturday from the northern parts of the country to the south, where about 2,000 lightning days can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
The central part of the earth is envisioning a more uniform primer.
According to Tuovinen, such a thunder is rare.
Coe praises Russia's "open minded" apology for the doping scandal
World Athletics Officer Sebastian Coe praised the apology apologized by Russia as a result of a doping scandal on Thursday. Coe added, however, that it was not yet time to stop the Russian ban.
Russian athletics director Dmitri Shljahtin said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday, on the eve of the World Cup, that the ban on Russia was appropriate and that he was going to fight decisively against doping.
He said he regretted "for all athletes from whom gold or silver medals took place".
Despite his comment, the IAAF Congress voted to continue the ban. Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency's WADA report presented evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very straightforward, and that was a very open-minded presentation," CoE's chairman of the IAAF told reporters.
"The whole Council and the Congress were pleased that the Russian athletics association admitted that the country had undergone difficult times and announced that it would do its utmost to restructure its activities."
Coe said he was "satisfied" also with Russia's acceptance of the terms of the ban.
"I think we had a really constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the group's recommendation that it is not the right time to stop the Russian ban," Coe said.
"We have to do everything we can to normalize the situation in the coming months.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes away from a corrupted system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with a neutral athlete's status in World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday and have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
The leader of the IAAF team, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still has to meet many demands before its status can be restored.
"Testing is still inadequate, and coaches who continue to work continue to operate freely," he told reporters on Friday at the IAAF Council after his presentation in London.
The production company disappointed the poor success of the Tom of Finland movie
The Tom of Finland movie did not become such a success as the authors wanted, says Yle.
If honestly said, I'm disappointed, admitting the film was produced by Annika Sucksdorff YLE's CEO of Helsinki Film.
I was afraid that the Finnish filmmaker might be conservative and it seems that it is.
The film got its premiere in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached more than 100,000 viewers, which is about the movie budget, about five million euros, compared to a little.
This is no gain in the lottery, but now it is important that investors get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful domestically, they would already have got their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams of overseas releases, "Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
Provisions restricting the use of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from moving from Spain to Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, which is the most expensive football player ever.
Its possible sanctions for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA governing European football, which can prevent the teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced a fair game of economic rules, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million for the termination of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar's annual salary in the new company is tens of millions of dollars.
Neymar's transfer to France involves a wide range of economic considerations.
PSG has no difficulty paying Neymar's transfer money and attaches him to his star race, as it is financed by Qatar's oil-rich rulers.
The clubs may use large amounts of players to buy, but they must be balanced with real revenue sources so that football-related business is not loss-making.
The fair play of the game was drafted at the initiative of UEFA's French player Michel Platin in 2007.
As a former football player, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by debts was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of the fair game's financial rules shifted from club debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used by Chelsea for the first time in 2003 by Mr Roman Abramovich became more difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, used huge sums for player purchases and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period for a fair game rules will last until 2018. During this period clubs will have to make a maximum of 30 million euros in losses.
Even though Platini had to skip the UEFA chairman's duties in scandals in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
"The rules of the game are still in use and we will continue to apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the fair game rules in UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a one-off payment, it could periodize the account for the duration of his new contract.
Neymar has concluded a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual expense of 44.4 million for the next five years.
The first sanctions were awarded on the basis of the fair game rules in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, which is funded by Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was ordered to limit the Champions League group to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through the club-owned companies.
For example, if a Qatar based company supports PSG, but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal level of the market, UEFA will not calculate the aid as actual revenue.
This happened when UEFA decided in 2014 that the Qatar tourism authority's support for PSG was oversized.
It has also become apparent that part of Neymar's earnings in PSG could be funded by the fees paid by the organizing committee of the 2022 Football World Cup in Qatar.
However, PSG and the organizing committee have denied that Neymar would be making an ambassador in the World Championships. It would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to PSG's previous sanctions, UEFA will follow companies more closely than usual to circumvent the rules.
Sources from the situation reported on Thursday that UEFA has not negotiated with PSG for the transfer of Neymar.
The sources provided an interview with the Associated Press agency on condition that their identity was not disclosed because they did not have the power to discuss PSG's situation.
According to the most recent published financial statements, PSG's net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was over EUR 10 million.
Last year's financial statements have not yet been announced.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of tracking products and gambling products.
The company estimates that its net sales will grow by at least 30 percent with the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish League, which was clearly irritated by the best players in the world, tried to hinder Neymar's move and was allegedly in breach of the fair rules of the game.
"This is a definite financial doping case for both the club and the state," Spanish President Javier Tebas told the Spanish AS newspaper, referring to PSG's Qatar ownership.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the fact that the state finances football club activities. Arsenal is owned by an American sports boom.
"The case is a result of ownership that has changed the football environment completely in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns the soccer team.
It is very difficult to comply with the rules of the game in a fair game. There are so many different interests that the famous player represents the state. "
Now is a hurry: Finland's World Athletic Trainer stuck in Helsinki
The midfielder Arttu Pajulahti and three-seater Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazarya are stuck in Helsinki even though he should be trained in athletics at the World Championships in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the coach's advice.
Pajulahti competes tomorrow in the qualification for long jump and Mäkelä on Saturday in the three-lane qualifier.
However, the two-time coach Ghazaryan did not have a visa for the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to handle the matter at the British Embassy without success.
The coach has the invitation of organizers of the World Championships as a document, but he has not been eligible for a visa.
Is this the first Brexit's symptoms, or what, coach Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always been successful in managing visa issues in the past, but now there are some problems.
He will do everything he can to get to the scene.
Ghazary has worked for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for many years.
It's not that big.
As long as someone looks at the stadium in the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said his coach was out of control.
MM medal for Finland in London requires a miracle
World Athletics Championships will start in London this Friday and will last a fair week ending on Sunday, August 13th.
Athletics, cross-country and ice hockey are the kind of sport that Finnish athletic athletes can take passionate about year after year, whether it is a success or not.
In the hearts of athlete athletes, success is measured in medals.
Sure there are other metrics.
Less attention will be given to the youthful athletes' beautiful growth spirits from the prestigies to the other, where by gaining experience, mature athlete's performance to the level that the MM medal of adults is genuinely possible.
Now there are no young athletes in Finland in the small World Championships, and they do not even qualify.
World medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the attraction and surprise of sport is that wonders can also happen.
It pulls the athletes out of the TV screen and glue to watch the races, even though the London medals are eliminated due to the time difference just in the afternoon.
In the athletics of previous World Championships 2015, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by speculator Tero Pitkämäki.
The elephants are waiting for the medal at Pitkämäki even now, although the others tell the results of his past and other riders and Pitkämäki's absence in qualifying last summer.
Takking in these games anyway, Pitkämäki will be the story of a great Finnish sports hero.
Finishing the race for other Finnish athletes or making your own record is a good performance.
Hoping and believing that the athletics of Finnish athletics will be a realistic medal in the coming years will be a great success for young international prizes this summer.
The refinement of young talents and the financial support of its work is more important than maintaining a small elite of athletics athletes.
Success does not come in the moment, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience with training as well as athletic athletes.
Finns can also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique accomplishments.
Hopefully the London Games will remain in history as Usa's Bolt and Mo Farah races, not because of terrorism or cowardice attacks.

Viking Line's new express vessel boosted the port in Helsinki
The shipping company Viking's new express vessel FSTR is out of schedule very late.
The ferry had to leave Helsinki from Tallinn at 18.00.
The ship was in eight countries loading in progress.
The ship came to Helsinki late.
At least one and a half hours I've been waiting for you to get on the boat.
Now the car radio moves slightly, Johannes Rebane, who is waiting for entry at the port of Helsinki, told us at 7.30 pm.
Rebane thought that a new ship had become a technical defect.
Rebane reported that the shipping company had brought the boat to the water bottles waiting for their cars.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Grönlund tells IS that technical failure has come to light.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed from Tallinn's return journey for a couple of hours.
The ship had to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 20.15.

Small circle nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, both the 80's and the 90's grunge characters (while David Wain and Michael Showalter made the brilliant The State series for MTV) and their time - 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and other stars of the series moved to bigger stories.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the continuous reminiscence that we have missed in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product it feels like it has been living for a while.
The First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of the absurdity of humor (among other things, it was told by H. Jon Benjamin as the backdrop of a vegetable canter's voice).
At the core of the jokes, middle-aged Actors act as passionate teenagers who are approaching the age of majority, emphasizing the joke of making it impossible to reach the past.
Ten Years Later, where adults act as adults, are less emotional and parody is more fragmented: it parodies, for example, of the 90's stalker films, such as the horror film Hand for Every Cradle.
At one point one of the characters digs Apple Powerbook, inline skates and "other stuff from 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as in the past.
Good-bye Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has not yet got over to Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And in a crazy story, George Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) accompanies George H. W. Bush (played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best of them are side strokes.
Particularly fun is seeing the ever-present Paul Rudd, who has under his lower lip a pair of dildos or Matt Dillon's "soul patch" from the movie Singles. Andy, the king of the camp, plays Ruddy and starts to be an old man.
Occasional madness moments may bring this series off as a recursive Seven Up! Series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer - Twenty Years Later. In its last scene, a group of friends goes to the premiere of the Wet Hot American Summer movie.
The Comrade Detective series in Amazons, on the other hand, invokes another nostalgia: the spirit of the Cold War of the Americans, the Atomic Blonde movie and even the GLOW series of buttons in which the east meets the west.
The comedy series is created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made into a Romanian police pole of the 1980s, where a bourgeoisie couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
Starring Gregorina and Iosefina are Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici, whose chapters have been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
but much more is not it.
The series has some good visual jokes (police are spending time watching television on chess in the same way Americans look at football).
There are a number of famous actresses, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny, who have a fun game.
Comrade Detective, however, is too much involved with the repetition of a clumsy socialist drama - for example, there is a hidden killer behind Reagan's mask, which is why the series often starts to really feel clumsy with propaganda.
Six long sections are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough or plentiful.
In summary, the series might work better with agitprop satires, for example, when Gregor and Iosef are repeatedly at the US embassy, and there are always two fat men in the lobby with hamburgers.
The message to the imagined communist public is that Western culture can make all the consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginary Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: as a turtle we have our own recent history and their history.
Kouvolainen Toni Tauru on Saturday in the ring in Macau - meeting former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match up.
Toni Tauru gets tough in Macau, as Leandro Issa, a Brazilian fellow in the UFC last year,
The Brazilian also has a black belt and a world championship in jewels.
I once did myself against my parents.
It's a funny thing, says Tauru, 32.
The Kouvol had to climb the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The game was canceled due to logistical problems, but three battles were reached in the Chinese Autonomous Region of Macao on a timely basis.
Tauru has not encountered anything in the past.
This was the first time my match was canceled.
It annoyed me because preparation and training took a lot of time.
The coach, however, is pleased that a new date for the battle was achieved.
The waiting week does not have much to do with preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition, as it does not improve in a week.
The condition can go worse if you are doing too much now.
Tauru has encountered opponents in a few of his previous struggles whose strengths are in standing.
This time, the situation is different.
Issa Kouvola describes a typical Brazilian.
He is a pretty aggressive contestant.
I bet he will come on hard in the first installment and try to put it on the mat.
He has won the junior championship, so he knows how to wrestle.
The previous match in Kouvola did not go as planned.
Filipino Kevin Belingon hit Taurua badly at the corner, and victory was left to the Philippines.
I've never been so good, especially upright: he did not get any hits.
When I left to fall, he hit my eyebrows.
It really did annoy me.
New motivation
Some of the matchmakers flock once a year, some of them getting up in the ring more often.
For example, the incoming opponent Issa fought the last time in September.
Last year, Taurulla had three games.
Now is the second struggle of the current year.
Between the stroke has become pregnant.
I've been training in the past few years and have been in good shape all the time.
However, I have only taken part because of the match.
When the 32-year-old heard of a future encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a while.
I was training in Espoo and I got the joy of doing so.
We got really good training when there was one guy from Sweden.
Training was a great help because on Saturday, the Kouvolai will have to prepare for physical combat.
I've got to train against the same kind of opponents and practice training.
Being at high level is the mainstay of the 32-year-old.
You have to be smart.
If there is an opportunity, I will certainly go to the plot.
Sub-exports can not be given free of charge because they consume the most.
Macau is attracting Taurus in China earlier.
It's been heard by Chinese Las Vegas.
I think there is a big and nice evening in front.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to report that it keeps interest rates unchanged as economic growth has been ineffective and inflation has slowed down speculations on interest rate hikes.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow, and the Bank will shift interest rates, as more pressure on families' income levels is underway.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee decided to hold interest rates at 0.25 per cent by 6 to 2. The interest rate hike was gained less favorably this month, as economic growth has been ineffective.
In its quarterly inflation statement, the bank declined its forecast for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and its forecast for 1.6% in 2018. It also warned that households' income levels are under increasing pressure as inflation is expected to accelerate to close to 3% in the autumn.
According to the Bank, however, interest rate hikes are needed in the coming years to curb inflation boosted by Brexit and the Bank has indicated that borrowing costs may have to be higher than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive financial package, which began a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will terminate the Term Financing Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to offer via the program affordable funding to banks worth over GBP 15 million, or a total of EUR 115 million.
The Bank's interest rate decision says: "According to the Monetary Policy Commission's forecast, the slow development of GDP will continue in the next few years, as the decline in household real income reduces consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the bank reiterated that, to curb inflation, "some degree of tightening of monetary policy" would have to be "slightly broader" than expected.
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increases were "gradual" and "limited".
In May, the Bank predicted growth of 1.9 per cent this year, up 1.7 per cent for next year.
It now has a growth forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
The decline weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound weakened by 0.5 per cent and was $ 1.31. The euro weakened by 0.4 per cent to EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged after the weaker than expected growth rates dampened the increased expectations for interest rate hikes. GDP grew by 0.3 percent in the second quarter and 0.2 percent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope of accelerating inflation and of households with severe wage increases. According to the Bank, the situation is deteriorating even before it gets better.
The bank added that monetary policy "can not prevent" revenue decline in the coming years, but expects that wage developments will recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also strengthen the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which will partly offset the decline in private consumption.
The decision was made one year after the interest rate was reduced to 0.25% after the shock of the EU referendum that hit the pound.
The bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision will probably start to show up in prices and economy only after four years.
Before the latest central bank decision, interest rate hikes had begun to demand even more loudly as inflation tightened pressure on households. Three decision makers called for a 0.5 per cent rise in July.
Inflation slid last month to 2.6% from 2.9% in June, but according to the Bank, it was expected and inflation will tighten again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the overrun of the two percent target was due to "completely" low pounds.
"In view of the recent fall in swap rates, the competition in the mortgage market seems to be tightening further as creditors are feverishly seeking customers and want to end the year," says Andrew Montlake, Coreco Mortgage Brokers Director.
"The markets look particularly good for those with the current loan agreement coming to an end. Re-contracts are even more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also unreliable options."
NHS sets 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
From September onwards, patients can be prescribed a "reverse" HIV-blocking drug. The Supreme Court finalized a dispute over the financing of medicines in the UK public health care system (NHS).
The NHS reported that Pre-Exposure Treatment (PrEP) is prescribed for approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. Prior to intercourse, the drug has been found to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% of high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund an experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court ruling last year, according to which the NHS is able to pay for PrEP, although it claims that the local authorities should finance it.
The UK's NHS director, Simon Stevens, called the decision announced on Thursday as "a major new intervention" and described by the National AIDS Organization as "crucial moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield start to receive first-class adventures, which will expand to other clinics in October, with a full range of experiments in England by April 2018.
Pre-Exposure Treatment (PrEP) is an HIV medication prior to intercourse that reduces the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection in risk groups.
Before a medication, it means that there are enough drugs in the body during intercourse to prevent HIV infection.
The medication can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, and people with HIV positive partner who are not receiving effective treatment.
The clinics choose the candidates who meet the criteria for men, women and transgendered people, and those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to have antiretroviral treatment for their illness.
People resident in England and enrolled in general practitioner can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The program pays 10 million pounds, and the British NHS signed a contract for medicines this week following an international bidding process.
The purpose of the experiment is to evaluate the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and treatment.
"This major new intervention should complement and intensify existing, versatile and increasingly effective ways of preventing HIV," says Stevens.
"It's another major achievement in over 30 years of struggle to tackle the greatest human health problem."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, head of the National AIDS Organization.
"If PrEP is properly targeted to those in need and in risk groups, it can have a reversal effect on the England HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, a group of people at risk will receive a drug through an NHS-funded trial that they can independently decide without the need to negotiate with a partner, and it has an empowering effect that will improve the lives of many people.
This was a welcome news. "
"It is now important to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country, and no one in the risk group is excluded from it," says Ian Green, Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP used in the experiment has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect people from 10,000 risk groups from HIV infection."
"The launch of the PrEP trial is a welcome event that protracted in vain for several months due to government slowdown," says Shadow Government Health Minister Sharon Hodgson.
"We have evidence that the drug may have a revolutionary impact on our work to prevent HIV and end this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
Now, it is important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible across the country, so we can protect the vulnerable to HIV and get one step closer to a situation where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully stopped. "
The quality of life: the interlayer and the brilliant interior design have made the home of a small Earl's Court a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, enthusiastic about renovating real estate, moved from a Knightsbridge residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Elizabeth's style-style house. The success of the remodeling is that Joanne has not yet packed his camels and changed it.
"Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge for a much larger apartment," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went here on the apartment screen and found that the rooms were as high as in my current apartment.
I got hungry right away and bid on the same day. "
After that, about 90 square feet of housing has experienced a complete deformation.
It was a two bedroom apartment, where the bedroom only came from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more space and an intermediate layer to make room height.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
They were my claim, "he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed Planning Office in Notting Hill, where Erfan was tasked with utilizing the space of nearly four feet of high-rise rooms and creating an apartment that was not just a renovation and a sales destination but a home.
The height of furniture was not enough in two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate layer that could stand.
The solution demanded Erfan's creative thinking.
"Steel structures are quite complicated.
The facilities had to be arranged on top of each other so that they did not need to twist.
The structures had to be modified so that the height is just right on both them and below. "
Erfan was able to place two full-height rooms in the room, fascinating with details.
The interlayer opens with a copper grid window in Retrouvius in a stylish living area.
Mirrored furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouillen vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, sense of space and light.
The mirrors at each end of a short aisle will make the passage more effective than the actual one.
The mirror in the kitchen space is like a window that opens to another room.
Inside mirrored furniture has storage space for Joanna's cutlery and glassware.
The elegance is further enhanced by the fact that the kitchen is concealed when it is not used.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution,
but in the Joanna's kitchen it's unique that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of a design," Erfan says of the steel-reinforced veneered MDF door.
"It's balanced, that is, it slides when you lift it very easily."
With the clever space use and storage space design Joanne got 16 extra squares, second bedroom and a better floor plan.
"When selling a flat, the area solves - or appreciating the property," Erfan says.
"In the case, a real estate agent walks into the apartment and drops the price on the basis of the area."
In Joanna's apartment area was added using high-quality materials that add luxury to the space.
"The resident is in touch with the materials of the apartment, and the tunnel to the apartment is partly based on them," Erfan says.
"No one is clinging to electric wires in the walls.
They are important too, but not the same way. "
Joanna's apartment is an example that good design and extra stars can make the base house extraordinarily fine.
Then it may also happen that the apartment no longer wants to move away.

He is breeding us with fresh chili
In the summer of 1996, a chef selling Thai food was published in Lahti Market.
The gentlemen did not dare to taste, but walked past.
In the queue, food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, familiar with Panja.
He did not know much about Finnish, and the Finns at that time did not yet belong to the Thai.
Since the people did not dare to eat, Panja offered free tastes.
This is how he taught the Lahters to eat Thai desserts at a time.
Taste the countries, he said.
I just lay down on hooks.
I was getting more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened her restaurant at the Lahti Market Hall.
There were two small tables, the seats could be less than 20.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but to sit next to the ventoveri.
When hungry and places are limited, you can not leave empty chairs between themselves and guests.
We got to know each other better and we became friends.
Finally I sat down in the diner with a dictionary, learning Thai.
Two years went to the market hall, but then the restaurant had to be changed because the spices that were made by us actually heard too much of the hall.
A new place was released from the end of the shopping mall.
There is space.
Now we are the locals to sit at our own tables, only in the most crowded times we will be shy to ask the guest whether there is space next to them.
Panja knows his client.
He is told about the whereabouts and who he is.
He knows what food each eats.
He has seen how the customer's life varies and the food chain changes.
She remembers what a man named I was eating my first spring worm.
She remembers me with a lazy and fat, and remembering what I was young.
It's nice to go for lunch a little later than others, sit next to my kitchen next to the kitchen door, and change the conversations with Panja.
Food is not the most important thing we get from it.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with fresh chilli sauce.
In addition to our taste, he has opened our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many people talk to him about Thailand - thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he has had difficulty, he is always friendly.
He is hard-working.
She goes to a restaurant on a mushroom and blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant celebrated a craving for two decades.
We customers got dessert with strawberry cake.
Without alarm or attention went this important day, at work.
Findings from an underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to attack Europe
In early 2008, the security authorities received a major list of anti-terrorist work.
The list contains more than 170 Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are altogether 173 people and the document includes not only their personal information, but also pictures of each.
There are over 130 Iraqi people mentioned in the list, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Ilta-Sanomat told us about the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now, the location and the information contained in the list have been refined.
According to the newspaper, Iraqi Special Forces found a terrorist's personal data and a list of images while investigating an underground base in the terrorist organization in Mosul.
The US intelligence authorities assessed the authenticity of the papers and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The underlying fear was that something big and serious would be planned by Western terrorists in the fall of Isis in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and images of all persons, but also their birthdays, invented aliases, and information about their country of origin.
The list also lists the terrorist specialties.
For example, the 27-year-old Sami, who is on the list, reads Abu Assid al-Almani, a German, as a battle.
He is reportedly leaving Germany in 2012, first traveling to Egypt, then to Libya and later to Turkey through Syria to join the Isis ranks.
A suicide bomber has been written as a specialty next to his picture.
There is no more information about the fate of a man.
There are about 6,000 fighters out of Europe in Isis, whose fate is uncertain.
The man fell under the surface in Helsinki's Tokoinranta
According to interviews with the rescue department, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
Bunny can save a drowning spirit.

Brothers are fighting over $ 500 million worth of real estate assets
Two brothers argue over Victoria's largest property empire worth more than $ 500 million, which is linked to a family business founded 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Former Carlton football club president and real estate developer Colin De Lutis live in the Toora area of justice just three houses away from her younger brother Paul, the younger brother has taken the highest court to dispute the division of property and business property between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave a family business as early as 2014, but there is a bitter controversy about the difference.
Brothers and their moms Anna owns 38 property worth more than half a billion dollars. The family began to accumulate assets when they bought it from Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store, which expanded the chain of 160 stores.
The retail chain was sold for $ 85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul is about one-third of the company's assets, Paul describes his father as "the family's leading force and central character."
According to legal documents, the division of property means that Colin owns some $ 316 million in real estate and Paul is worth $ 176 million.
Paul is not happy with the allocation of real estate and money.
"In my opinion, Colin left the best properties for himself," Paul wrote in his first oval testimony in 2015.
The case was dealt with last Friday for the first time in the Supreme Court following several conciliation attempts.
The brothers are now arguing about who controls the existing business, and Paul claims Colin has shut her off.
According to Colin, the argument is wrong. He blames Paul for the poor management of some real estate.
Colin writes about one of her first sworn testimonies that she would like to reach a solution.
"According to our Italian tradition, family is the most important for me," Colin says in her statement.
There are hundreds of pages of voluntary statements, emails, and reports, including consulting consultants such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, including Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and his late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who founded dairy and delicatessen shops in the late 1950's. At the beginning of the 1970s, they bought from Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when a family bought Collingwood for a property on which Colin founded the first denim store in the family.
Colin says she has founded a trade in "the last years of the high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis tells us that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to move the property to his sons well.
"Luigi often said that he did not want the brothers to come to justice," Anna writes in her statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer in the De Lutis Group's business. According to Colin, Mark received $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million in leaving the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "bitter on the financial terms of their departure".
Colin has kept a low profile even though he is a former board member of the Australian Football League and the best friend of television star Eddie McGuire's latest biography in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered, telling her in her text message that she can not comment on it because it is being processed in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw the name of our family to the litigation," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accept his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way," Colin continued and said he hoped further that a solution would be reached.
On Friday, hope seemed to be gone.
"We will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit President's media usage.
Others have tried and failed.
John F. Kelly may finally succeed.
First.
According to Poltico magazine, the new head of staff at the White House intends to limit President Trump's media usage and tracking news to keep the boss so often in trouble.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reported:
"When John F. Kelly, the new staff manager of the White House, met with senior staff on his first working day, he addressed the key problem he plans to resolve: he intends to limit access to information by President Donald Trump.
Kelly told the workers of the White House that all the information - both printed and in the press conference - must pass through him because the president makes better decisions when he receives good information. "
Kelly's words make sense, but others have also tried to limit Trump's media usage and failed.
President Trump has a decade's relationship with television - and as President he still has a lot of television.
"If presidential candidate Trump was nervous about unfair news coverage, he was encouraged to show that the sympathetic media handled things more fairly," Sam Nunberg, who worked as a counselor at Trump's campaign, told the Politico newspaper in February.
Tara Palmeri, a journalist at Politicon, wrote at the time that "the six former campaigners say Trump's Twitter's use of control is essential for his personal media flow to include a steady stream of praise."
All right.
But it is ridiculous to claim that Trump's use of Twitter would have been under control.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that we do not know - maybe Trump Tweets would be without their efforts even more brisk.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump left unanswered.
If his staff has even been able to prevent him from causing problems a few times, their job has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing a fever.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to push their case by giving Trump information that supports their views. That information can be reliable - or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers deliberately give the President questionable information.
Editor Shane Goldmacher told a case:
"Trump's current and former employees say he can tremendously infamy in newspaper clippings that criticize him - especially if they tell about harmful data leaks, and he's got to know exactly where the information comes from.
That was the end of February when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of the news website GotNews.com, found by Charles C. Johnson, accusing Katie Walsh of Deputy Chief of Staff for several White House data leaks.
Johnson was permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and he had previously filed false accusations and subsequently withdrew them, and he did not provide any concrete evidence.
Nonetheless, Trump had started reading the story to ask the staff at Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that Reince Priebus, HR Manager at that time, and Rob Porter, White House Secretary of Personnel, had "attempted to introduce Trump Document Management System".
And what was the result?
Kelly tries the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he turns out to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still pursuing their own affairs.
These unchanged facts make Kelly's task extremely difficult.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, according to AFP.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a € 222 million outlay for FC Barcelona in football in the Spanish league.
Neymar's agreement with Barcelona had therefore been dismantled and he was free to move to Paris Saint-Germain PSG.
A Huge $ 222 million transfer is the biggest in football history.
Earlier this was a record for Manchester United, which paid last year € 105 million for the French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatar Sports Investment company in Qatar.
The club is chaired by a former tennis professional from Qatar, Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.

Tourists returned over the ditch to "the Millionaire"
West Midlands's wealthiest landlords are once again jammed with persistent tourists who managed to cross the ditch called by the municipality and return to the adjacent field of houses.
The tourists parked about twenty caravans near a millionaire street near Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat, which they wanted to take over, bringing children, horses and vans to the army.
Tourists managed to cross the passage barrier that was left unprotected due to the path.
False residents have accused Solihull municipality of "the complete inability to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident tells tourists that they came on Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown passers-by with stones.
"The municipality has to work hard because it feels completely unable to solve the problem.
The tourists were here in May, then they left but returned again.
They came in the evening more and probably more today. "
The resident reported that the Birmingham municipality had solved the problem by prohibiting access to the parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it is frustrating to pay municipal taxes when the municipality can not do anything about it."
According to the other anonymous guest, it is ridiculous that the tourists returned shortly after they were driven away.
"They're more than done, and they've even dropped into a horse-grazing park."
According to a spokeswoman for the municipality of Solihull, the municipality is aware of the illegal camp near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking Solihull Police with the necessary legal steps to evict the campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for the gathering of evidence that as many local people as possible make the police report any disruptive or criminal activity.
It helps to create an overall picture of the situation for court processing. "
The ferocious people besieged the Portuguese turf
In Portugal, men who have been forced to pay for a beach full of people have been questioned today in court.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the fallout.
The two men fleeing the plane can be prosecuted for the death toll.
At the most, Portugal can get 16 years in prison.
A man flying by a small plane had to make a forced flight yesterday due to technical failure at the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the event, some of whom ran down to escape into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old male and eight-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane first hit the man who was in the back of the machine.
Immediately afterwards, the plane got up and when it landed again, it hit the head of the child, told Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl that got caught was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents did not get hurt.
On the beach, the people were besieging the small machine immediately after the turmoil.
The girl's father and other people went to the machine and started hacking it, told the case in Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It is a miracle that no more people died.
The two men on the plane did not get injured in the expulsion bill.
The tragedy lost to the foot of his leg won the World Cup again: "Without an accident I would not be a world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari early on Wednesday morning celebrated World Championships in the banked slalom race at Canadian Big Whites.
Greater Hamari also won Crossin MM gold in the games.
In total there are already three World Cup titles.
Time for amazing World Championships!
Two times the gold was handled, the time was drawn with a good heart rate, the Greater Hamar, cheered by telephone, rejoiced.
A 30-year-old compatriot congratulated her coach and well-prepared preparations in Finland.
According to Greater Hamar, the number of challengers in the species is increasing all the time.
The whole paralyzing has grown and developed a lot lately.
The differences are diminishing, and there are many new counters involved.
She always thinks that some black horse will be guaranteed.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Greater Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been enthusiastically drawn from his youth with his friends, and the accident did not want to get to the slope.
I would like to recall from time to time what kind of my life would be without the accident.
But my attitude has always been that it is unnecessary to lie.
Those cards are played which are distributed, emphasizes Greater Hamari.
It would be a cruel thing to say a serious accident and losing the limb to a happiness, and Greater Hamari does not do it.
But he turned to the toughest difficulty.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned to victory.
I would not be a triple world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the biggest boarder of the 23-year-old Greater Hamar was already fading.
The road to the peak started with a real act only after the accident.
I was a teenager with friends, and we were always excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dimmed a bit over time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow from the start of X-Games.
I would not have imagined beforehand.
I was 23 years old and I thought that this would be a long life if I stay here to be bitter and sorrowful.
I decided to pull the overalls off my neck and start working.
I would say that I've managed pretty well.
He was delighted by the choice of Leo-Pekka Tähti for a year as an athlete for the wheelchair player.
The four-time Olympic winner was awarded a prize at a sports club in January.
According to Greater Hamar, Star's victory is an important signal for the caretaker.
It was a big deal, and victory was definitely deserved.
This will surely also open eyes for the world of racing.
Since it is time to launch a double world champion Matti Suur-Hamar's year-long athlete campaign?
It will be seen in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Even Greater Hamar has not conquered all the coveted peaks.
Next year is a great goal.
A year later, the Paralympics will be in South Korea.
Yes, we're going to get the medal!
Majority of Syrian refugees refused to return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country
The Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey investigated the opinions and attitudes of young syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees bake bread at a refugee camp in Jordan.
A majority of Syrian youth does not believe to return permanently to their homeland.
According to them, the end of the Syria war and the departure of Isis from the country are the most important things that should take place so that they can return to their homeland.
The Trump administration can not see a change in the Syrian conflict.
Burson-Marsteller, a communications agency, explained the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
For nine years, Burson-Marsteller has been examining the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth.
This year, A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey investigated the opinions and attitudes of young syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian women aged between 18 and 24 were responsible for the study, half of which were women and half of men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not think to return to their homeland permanently in the future.
42% of respondents may think of returning to their country of origin and four percent could not say.
According to the study, the return of young people to the decision is most affected by the war in Syria and the presence of Isis in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be a permanent homecoming, while the quarter considers that the most important thing is leaving Isis.
Only under one-tenth of the most important factors affecting the decision are the improvement of the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military actions alone do not resolve the conflict
The Syrian youth was asked which factor is the most important for ending the conflict.
The majority are of the opinion that the end of the war is more relevant than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair quarter holds al-Assad's presidency an obstacle to the peace treaty.
Almost half of them believe that both the political and the military solutions are needed to end the ongoing Syria conflict.
To solve the conflict through military action alone, you do not believe it as a quarter of a century.
The majority of Syrian refugee youth see Isis's power weakened during the last year, while one in five felt its power was strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the struggle against the Jews, and generally against terrorism, is that the media would inform people of the fact that Isis has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many of them raised military action as well as education reform as a priority.
In the top 10, the most important thing would be to create more paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump administration on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of the respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Nearly every fourth believes the Syrian conflict is worsening in Trump.
Opinions are divided in two ways as to whether the participation of Russia and Iran has improved or aggravated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of her time tagging in order to keep the web in order - the database she develops is using, for example, Wikipedia and Google
The Espoo company MariaDB develops the "fastest growing" open source database in the world.
The main product of MariaDB, established by the co-entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, does not cost anything to the users and can be developed by anyone who is a good programmer online.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of a Finnish database, but paying customers may not be.
Databases enable huge masses of information to remain in order and quickly available.
For example, using Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the database of MariaDB or MySQL.
"All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the pictures are linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, a technology manager at MariaDB, spends about half of his time encoding.
A man doing the job of Kauniainen remotely manages to make sure that the Internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database MySQL together with Swedish company David Axmark.
In 2008, Sun acquired MySQL for billions of dollars, and one year later, Oracle bought software for Sun $ 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle transaction took place, a large part of MySQL developers announced their departure.
"They did not want to work on Oracle, which did not give a definite promise of MySQL's future," Widenius remembers.
At this stage, he had already set up a company that started to develop MariaDB.
She did not want her life to die.
I paid 20 of the best developers in Sun, so I secured the continuity of the code with the same friends that made it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
The name just had to be changed.
A foundation was established to oversee the development of MariaDB's Code Development.
"MySQL did not make these backups," Widenius is disappointed.
Although many have heard of Widening and MySQL's billion trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"In recent years, our growth rate has been around 50 percent per year," says Kenneth Paqvalen, CFO of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not making any profits yet, and Paqvalen is scarce in the company's benchmarks.
So far, he reveals that in the current fiscal year, MariaDB estimates that it will receive orders worth EUR 20 million.
As the database is free, the company has developed around it services from which business customers are willing to pay.
MariaDB also helps in exchanging databases, which can be over a year if the customer has used a closed database.
Switching from MySQL to MariaDB can be done instantly as they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank DBS in South-East Asia are paying customers of MariaDB.
Most popular cloud services such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB is automatically distributed to new users in Linux distribution packages, with MariaDB largely replacing MySQL.
Even though we are a small firm, we have contacts with the biggest gamblers.
"Among our customers are the world's largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central bank," Paqvalén lists.
Giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, and SAP are still in the database market with their closed databases.
Oracle's MySQL is a modest web site compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although research firm Gartner claims that the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, gamblers such as MariaDB are still idle, albeit fast growing syntax.
About $ 50 billion in the database market, open source databases do not even cost a billion.
However, the value of open source can not be measured in money alone, as most users do not pay for these software.
Research firm Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will already develop more than 70 percent of their internal applications over open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been exchanged at that time or a shift would have been initiated at least.
Big companies do not get new customers, as most opt for open source.
This has led to license fees for commercial databases having jumped into the clouds.
The companies want to make as much money as a smaller number of customers, "Widenius ponders.
As the exchange of a closed database is difficult, most of the customer companies have been subjected to price increases obediently.
"There are a lot of customers to whom transition is really difficult because their old applications and others are closed in a closed database," Widenius says.
He still believes that customers' scale is getting full.
As license fees increase every year, the client will sooner or later switch to the open source database.
The price is 10-20 percent of the previous, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database.
In addition, many companies are facing major system changes when they move their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, many change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a loan of EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank at the EIB.
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees globally and is now going to hire more.
One of the reasons for EIB funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually from databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax havens more efficiently," Paqvalén says.
Widenius is annoyed at how money is spent in closed-end healthcare systems in Finland when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say open source is an ideology, but I think it's a better way to make code.
The community will help and do something that you do not invent or can not do.
55-year-old Widenius belongs to another Finnish Linux developer Linus Torvalds, along with the most well-known open source promoters.
Widenius helps other companies to develop functional business models over open source.
I still like 4-5 words every year around the world on this topic.
Italy strengthens its attitude towards non-governmental rescue vessels
Italy has warned non-governmental organizations that rescue their fleets of refugees in the Mediterranean that they should not continue their activities unless they are bound by the new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit themselves to the new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue their activities," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with La Stampa newspaper in Turin.
Minnitin's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a German Jugend Rettet charter, whose crew was suspected of collaborating with human traffickers to promote illegal immigration.
Only a year ago, the relief organization refused to comment on the detailed prosecutions of Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"It is and will be important for us to save lives, and we are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization said in a statement published in social media.
"We can only evaluate accusations when we have gathered all the information we need and we are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Jugend Rettet Iuventa since October.
The crew is suspected of having taken the refugees directly to the boat by boat, re-accessing them.
One such case is claimed to have occurred only a couple of kilometers from the Libyan coast, which is reflected in the prosecution's document, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of being threatened with the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the region.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who oversees the operation.
Only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations have hitherto agreed to follow the guidelines: Save the Children of MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
who announced on Thursday that new rules would be unnecessary but acceptable as they would not cause "significant changes or barriers" to the organization's rescue operations.
Among the refusals to comply with the Code of Conduct are the Nobel laureate of Doctors Without Borders.
Mr Minniti noted that the number of immigrants arriving in Italy during the rescue operations has fallen dramatically over the past few weeks, as he points out that measures to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors are starting to produce results.
"In the last few days, light has started to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that plans are to continue this month with the Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of being killed by his unmarried partner Enontekiö, suspect found on the terrain - a case for the prosecutor
The suspected crime occurred in Enontekiö Kuttonen last December.
According to the police, a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish unmarried partner.
Earlier, it was reported that both were seasonal workers.
The police also reported that the suspect would have fled with the two dogs on the terrain after he had worked.
The man was found cold in the terrain, and he did not resist when he was caught.
The cause of the case has to be lifted in less than a week.
The case may be filed in the Lapin käräjäoikeus in August.
Robert Hardy, a renowned Harry Potter and all-armed friend of mine, has died
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced on Thursday by this family.
Hardy, born in 1925, began her acting career at the age of 24 in the theater.
During her long career she also starred in movies and television.
Hardy is especially remembered of the role of Magic Cornelius Toffe in the Harry Potter films and her veterinary roles in her All-armed Friends TV series based on James Herriot's book.
The BBC's popular series was filmed for a total of seven.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for suicidal smuggling text messages
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and phone calls that were considered to have incited her boyfriend Conrad Roy to suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months in prison and five years in prison.
Carter was sentenced to death in June. His boyfriend, Conrad Roy, committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
"My family has crashed," Conrad's father said at Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter appealed to the judgment and waited for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was threatened with a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffer from mental health problems.
Carter dressed in red pants and cream-colored blouse listened to the hands of the judgments crossed with tears in the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He decided on Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act, "the prosecutor continued.
"He has not shown repentance."
According to Carter's lawyer, the incident was due to the "terrible circumstances that Carter deeply regrets".
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, was of the opinion that Carter's "age or maturity level, not even mental health problems, had a significant impact on his work".
The prosecutor read out Conrad's mother Lynn Roy's statement, where she told me that "I do not spend a day lest I mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how to cope with all this. I try my best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear. "
Conrad's sister, Camdy Roy, told her that she "persecutes" the idea that she will never see her brother's wedding and not be aunt to her children.
"It's painful to lose a person who has been in my life every day since my birth, and that pain will never be lost," Camdy said.
The case seems to be a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in car crash in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it became apparent that Carter had, in her text messages, incited her boyfriend to commit suicide.
"Carter yourself, jump from the roof, cling to yourself, I do not know there are many ways," Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent to Roy during the two weeks prior to his death, Roy was on holiday with his family.
Just before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "You just have to launch a generator and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter caught sight of Roy's death, and Judge ordered that Carter would not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the opinions of experts.
Only a few have defended Carter, one of whom is Amanda Knox, 30, who was sentenced to murder in the UK by his brother in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion in which he states: "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary-General: You were worst in Russia since the Cold War
Military Federation between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, comments NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia of its position and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in a CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could strive for close co-operation with Russia.
But, particularly after the unlawful attachment of Crimea in 2014 and continuing instability in Russia in eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to working so that tensions do not get stuck.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage with Russia in political dialogue to avoid an escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump found that the US-Russia route had drifted even to a dangerous level.
Trump urged to congratulate the congressional countries for the bad news, which last week approved new anti-Russian sanctions.
Audi makes changes to the 850,000 diesel engine due to the back burner experienced by car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW offered to update over 350,000 car software.
The BMW head of the company said the company believes that "it's even more sensible than driving restrictions." He referred to European cities, including BMW's hometown of Munich, who are considering limiting or prohibiting the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced changes to more than three million Mercedes-Benz engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke about the callback.
European carmakers have been heavily marketing diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing emission-neutralizing equipment will increase, which makes it difficult for cars to price competitively.
German carmakers are closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of lobbing the big car companies and ignoring the problems.
Volkswagen puts on the car scrapping devices that reduced emissions to comply with the regulations, and in the normal run, the emissions were higher.
There have been charges against several Volkswagen leaders in the United States, but leaders are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the director of the Audi's Motor Development Department, former head of thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be surrendered to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was caught in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system to circumvent European emission standards in its cars, based on a similar survey in the United States.
Audi's investigation can significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the luxury car manufacturer's share of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionate.
The Venezuelan vote started a chilling investigation, major demonstrations in the campaign
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million more than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion of a firm that has no role in election results, Tibisay Lucenan, Chairman of the National Election Commission, told reporters.
Maduro assures the crisis will end
On Sunday, Venezuela voted for a controversial vote representing a constitution that is intended to change the constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticized the vote and held protests against it.
The opposing opposition to Maduroa has postponed their own demonstrations so that they would be on the run.
According to the newspaper El Pais, the country's national security forces started local time on Wednesday night to take over the country's parliament building.
The troops are to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change threatens the Provencal lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Southern French Provence region, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender was reduced due to drought and disease-carrying insects. Scientists and farmers are struggling to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is almost endangered in the Provencal region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years, with the fall of spring and especially the fall in rainfall," says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM research facility in Provence.
"This shortens the lavender lifespan.
Additionally, drought has brought to the area many small strains that spread microbes. "
The bets are hard.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and is also a highly desirable ingredient for perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of long hooves and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or completely missing," Chaisse says.
"In other words, essential oils containing oil are less."
The solution is sought by intensifying irrigation, slowing down soil moisture evaporation and spraying plants with a protective clay and water mix, as well as developing droughts that are more resistant to varieties.
The murder of a journalist reflects the growing threat in Mexico
Once a week, the Riodoce newspaper, which appears once a week, usually meets on Wednesday to discuss how the latest cases of organized crime, corrupt authorities and endless drug smuggling in the state of Sinaloa are being discussed.
Today, however, is being discussed about security because of the recent tragedy.
Suppliers are urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss what's safer: leave the kids home or take them to the delivery that was grenade hit in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.
They ask the journalists for the names of each group. There is no need for evidence, observations and feelings are sufficient.
The names of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists who are suspected of having board or drug cartels are written on the board are criminals who make the news of Mexico's chaos a life-threatening one.
According to the Journalists' Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered after President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. The federal state has 589 attackers and threatened journalists, with at least seven journalists in seven states being assassinated this year.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, editor and inspiration of Riodoche.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote of many of his books on drug abuse.
He is deeply caught, even though he is present everywhere, and the façade of Riodoco's building is covered by a huge picture, where Valdez looks like a middle finger, and says: "Right." The thirty-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez dressed in T-shirts adorned by Valdez's smiling faces.
The meeting will take place less than two months after the death of Valdez. Reporters discuss their common trauma, nightmare, insanity, and paranoid fears.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was set up specifically to deal with journalists 'cases, but according to the Journalists' Committee, only two prosecutions have been filed so far.
Journalists' murderers are seldom faced with justice, as are thousands of drug-related killings and organized crime every year, only a few get to court.
Riodocen journalists are planning to pursue the Sinaloa violent writing, even though they are mourned and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security conference is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is literally a waste of time," he says.
"We can not trust anyone as long as we do not know the cause of the event."
Valdez had left Riodoca in the capital of Culiacan in the morning of May 15,
He had driven only two blocks to his red Toyot when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots. The amount is supposed to be in the magazine's name: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove off Valdez's car and crashed it somewhere.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She had a wife and two adult children.
Rumors are moving fast and floating freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's death is still a mole.
Sinaloa has been Mexico's most bloodthirsty battlefield since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January. Competing groups want to fill the void.
In Sinaloa streets, one or more people are shot dead every day, and the funeral home has decorative two-story graveyard buildings that are bigger than many households.
Coastal state is "peaceful" when only one cartel dominates ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and leader of Riodoche, 60, Ismail Bojorquez, is well aware of the guilt of being unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a rival group that goes against the Guzman boys.
The story could get angry with Guzman's boys: the gang-suspected customers bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine came to sales outlets.
The second mistake was that Valdez was forced to leave the country after another newspaper published in the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in journalist violence.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided to set up a Riodo with five colleagues in 2003. The shares of the magazine were then sold at $ 50.
Sinaloa "was impossible to do journalism without tackling the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to feel bold and honest, and its sales and advertising revenue grew.
Reporters appreciated the possibility of publishing hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its foundation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for its news coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists of his courage to follow the Mexican drug trafficking story without hesitation.
She frankly admitted she was afraid.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said when he received the award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
Drug trafficking is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"The reporter must take charge of him - or show off stupid.
I do not want anybody to ask me where I was when sowing death here - why did not I tell you what was going on? "
Riodone's staff desperately needed a Valdezia scammer who cursed as a port worker, they miss a friend who always got hugs and advice, they miss a teacher who knew how to cope.
They trusted in his routines.
He always used to panamahattu.
She went to the opposite bar of El Guayabo and always sat at the same table.
Now they are asking if routines are in their fate.
The death of a colleague has also led them to reflect on how they can best work and survive.
"Criminals do not like it if we deal with their women and children and their clean business, their secret drug traffickers.
They were left out of the way, "Bojorquez says.
It meant, in the best case, strong self-censorship and self-protection,
trusting in my instincts.
If you feel that everything is wrong, you have to stay away.
The problem is that, according to Riodoco's journalist Andres Villarreal, "the impression may fail, and so did Javier's case".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The business environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones could not be brought to a room where Riodo's security training was held. A few days ago, it had become clear that only government-sponsored spyware had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two policemen had been sheltered from the shadows of a tree at 40 degrees Celsius.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoche's premises, located in a four-story building in the middle class Culiacan area.
Some of the reporters half-heartedly wondered if these two policemen belonged to the 50% that the state governor did not trust.
It had been months since the journalists had been in the mountainous countryside controlled by drug geniuses.
This week's edition of Riodoco's delivery spelled out three main stories.
The boxing abduction Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also wanted to reveal that the government's spending was focused on the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one block from the prosecutor's office, was kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information about who was kidnapped and how, so it was necessary to go cautiously: everybody in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug traffickers and authorities.
The journalist learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Revolutionary Party (PRI), PRI has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Governors belonging to it have recently been accused of corruption in a lot of publicity cases.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about previous cases in the same place. In one of the "El Chapo" Guzman's sons managed to escape and avoid the army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez had a reliable information about kidnapping.
"In the past, we already knew what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been slim because of his body structure, nickname "El Flaco", Ohukainen.
"Now all connections to our data sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse that keeps journalists and stickers against the persecution of journalists. Journalists have received a new, unexpected task: they have become media activists.
The reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs when he left the next morning at a local prosecutor's office on a protest that was again the cause of a new murder of a journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in western Michoacan State three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was discovered, based on the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Reporters have begun to protest more loudly throughout the country. "SOS Press" texts appear on the sidewalks and buildings in the protests.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to get international support for investigating the Valdez case.
On the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused authorities of spying and killing journalists because they told the truth.
He has since asked that he be removed from the board of government because he is worried that he can not be mad at being objective.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists are surrounded by organized crime, the authorities allowing crime and the indifferent society.
In his last book, Narja journalism Valdez writes that drug smugglers are killing journalists, but they are also killed by the orders of politicians and security forces in concert with organized crime.
According to Articulo 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were made by the police and the authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
The murders have a depressing effect.
No one misses the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the north of the Tamaulipas border six years ago.
His body was marked by a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I am here because of my writing."
Next to her cut head there was a computer keyboard and earphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to end their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern Chihuahua border state after the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue to operate like Nuevo Laredo El Manana, although its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message on its front page for drug cartels: "What do you want us to do?"
Some of the reporters have fled from their states or across the country.
The decision is difficult.
In the countryside it is difficult to find a job, and all the time you have to be careful.
Sometimes criminals are looking for a journalist, as apparently came to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a Mexico City apartment in 2015 three months after he fled from Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra - whom he used to be a poet - admits that writing about drug trafficking is scary.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on the way to hell," he says.
Some time ago Riodocen's journalists sat on the sidewalk at Friday morning, when the latest issue of the magazine was finished. Suddenly, their phones began to color as a message.
In the shooting between competing gangs and security forces, 19 people died in Mazatlan's beach resort.
The war escalated, as was promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Reporters put news on the Riodoco website on the sidewalk on their smartphones.
The page had to be reinstated the next day.
The sirens roared nearby - again a new shootout.
Bojorquez took a look at the police guarding the delivery:
if they were afraid they covered it very well.
Riodo's delivery continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait where the man looks like a middle finger for the whole Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can not even consider quitting. "How could I stop the magazine when our trainee asked to go to the street to do the same thing the same day that Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge back-load - "Hard Place"
In Hannu Manninen, the 39th birthday celebration in April was short, as a professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic Games.
However, the traineeship started disastrously when Manninen became ill.
It started a long period of sickness that stretched for almost five weeks.
May went practically completely in illness.
First there was a flu and finally a kind of childhood like an ear infection that I had to eat with antibiotics.
I could only make ten percent of the planned exercises.
I do not remember when I was last long sore.
It was a tough place when I did not get the work done, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanom.
The test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion did not receive a traineeship until the second week of June, which was reflected in the KIHU Roller Skate Testing at the 12th and 12th Sports Expo.
In the test, the athlete skiers on roller skates on a mat, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes the car stops for about ten seconds and the tester takes a milky sample from the athlete's fingertip with a needle.
Last fall I covered the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I was only 28 minutes.
It came against the wall, Manninen says.
In the better direction
After the initial difficulties, Manninen says she has remained healthy.
I've done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises that I've been trying to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now behind is a really good five-week episode.
It was also a mornings of one and a half weeks for a vacation to fly.
I went with my family to visit the cottage too.
Last season, Manninen took part in only four World Cup competitions before Lahti World Championships.
The best result was seen immediately in the opening competition when Manninen rose to top 18.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and national team head coach Petter Kukkonen have completed a training and competition plan until February.
We are now seeking a different rhythm of exercise compared to last season.
After the first snowball races, Ruka would have a weekend of three World Cup races.
In December, it was supposed to be at least one weekend in the World Cup, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans would still be included in Seefeld.
Hopefully, the name will be found in the Olympic team list, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympic Games would be Manninen's sixth winter Olympics.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City, 2002, a gold medal with a nummarian underlined in a team competition.
The dinosaur protected himself from his enemies by disguising himself
At first it looks like a scary statue.
Now researchers have revealed the first research results of a rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miners, which was so well preserved that experts call it dinosaurs Mona Lisia.
It had been so well preserved that scientists could even determine that its skin was reddish brown and had a "problematic past".
According to Current Biology, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur of all time and the world's best species.
The recently found fossil is a nodosaurus, which means mid-seasons of the crater period 110-112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this astonishing well-preserved fossil to be a really significant find.
According to National Geographic, armored vegetarian is the best-preserved fossil ever in its kind.
It was found on the Suncor Millenium mine in North Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by Shawn Funk mining company.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely at his findings.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of the Tyrrell.
There, the bee was excavated for six years on a 1 100 kilogram of boulder.
The results of hard work are now visible.
"If you squeeze the eyes, you can almost believe it's sleeping," says science-fiction writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Tyrrell Royal Museum.
"It remains in the science of the history of dinosaurs Mona Lisana, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
In the investigation of the skin, it was apparent that dinosaurs eating meat were likely to be a major threat to this vegetarian, even though it had a armor and resembled a walking tan tank.
Its red-and-white armor masks it from its predecessors, and it was also protected from the darker and lighter color that still exists in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to mix with their environment and to avoid their enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus became headlines in May and is now exhibited in the Royal Palaeontological Museum of the Tyrrell.
Scientists have named it Borealope by markmetchelli according to museum technician Mark Mitchell. Mitchell belonged to the team, which took over 7,000 hours to dig dinosaur.
The Nodosaurus has remained so remarkably well that Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to determine the shapes and the shape of the body and armor of the body.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a general coloration, where the body is darker and lighter.
The observation was still a surprise because Borealope is considerably larger than current animals with similar coloration.
It can be deduced that the dinosaurs eaten by the flesh precipitated it to such an extent that evolution favored concealment as a means of survival instead of struggle.
Existing animals such as deer, zebra and armadillo have the same coloring, they are considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that the nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
"The predation of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells how dangerous dinosaurs were in the cage," Brown says.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the nodosaurus reveals that its leather was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, exploring, inter alia, the contents of the intestine to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that it fell when he died in the river and drifted to the sea where it sank on his back to the seabed.
At that time Alberta was as warm as it is now in Florida, and rivers and seas are likely to go far beyond what is now.
"This nodosaurus is really remarkable because its tangy leather has been preserved and has been preserved in three dimensions in its original form," says Brown.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early Sabbath period
Understanding it does not require much imagination: if you lighten your eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping. "
The season was the era of teropods, huge, two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king Tyrannosaurus rex, or millions of years ago in the Boreal Game, its mighty predecessors may have caught this armored dinosaur.
Tyrannosaurus rex predecessors included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, a 11.5-meter long six-monster monster.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology. They believe that Borealope was washed out into the sea after his death and mummified into mud.
It was found on the Suncor Millenium mine in North Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by Shawn Funk mining company.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world with its skins and armor slag from the muzzle to the hip.
The nodosaurs were on average five meters long and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
Two halfmeter peaks emerged from their chambers.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian ran through the present western Canada until the flooded river carried it to the open sea.
Its armor has been kept alive in the submarine tomb.
Its fossilized remains have remained so well that its leather remains in the ravaged sheets of the armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko also wrote in National Geographic that such survival is "as rare as the lottery.
The more closely it is, the more amazing it feels.
Its densely populated sheets on the kallopansar still have fossilized leather.
Its right front leg is on its side, five toes up.
I can also calculate the bottom of my foot. "
How did one activist learn to answer the question: to whom do the streets belong?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on September 9, 2014.
He had arrived days earlier in New York from his home in St. Louis and sat on Airbnb on bed browsing Facebook with his phone.
Then he noticed a message from a high school friend:
"The police killed an 18-year-old young man, and his body is still in the street."
Not surprised, he noticed that no one else had sent the same information to his feed, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
In his timeline there were numerous re-openings by @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a pope who lives in St. Louis, who twisted in real time with the death of Michael Brown. The White Police had fired an unarmed 18-year-old black-haired Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
That user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and to his community.
When he returned to Twitteri later that night, he was told people would gather to Canfield Drivelle.
The users post photos of the police clutter and screaming people and Brown's dad, who claims to be the man he was saying in the placard: "Ferguson's police killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed real-time video, where the police stood in front of the protesters barking with the dog.
He also says he saw a video where another policeman tune his rifle and shouted: "I'll kill you all ... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell recalled.
"It was not the kind of murder we are used to, which could be said to be typical.
Then I felt cold colors.
I was angry and cried. "
He reserved the return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at eleven o'clock in the evening, and Ferrell went to his six-year-old daughter from his father and decided he would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next few years, is a documentary film called "Whose Streets?", Which premiered in cinemas on August 11,
The film is a story of survival and reflection, love and loss, and strength and perseverance from the point of view of local people who started to respond to the streets.
When Ferrell drove toward Ferguson with a flower vase and a daughter dressed in a compatible crown, they recaptured the question of "how to live in blacks and in what circumstances." They had talked countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how the blacks have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We are going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and it is not right."
"I could not take her daughter with me," Ferrell told later.
"Today's events are ... the culmination of past events.
My daughter has the right to know it and grow it.
He needs to have the capability to activism and organization, but he must also know the black layers of different layers of experience and circumstances of life, and he needs to know what we need to do to release, to free ourselves.
Although fortunately I was able to protect him from blatant racism, he is still the same as any other black girl.
I feel like I would hurt him if I protected him from reality. "
Their first stop at Ferguson was South Florissant Road, opposite the police station, which became a camp site for activists waiting for information on the case and ultimately knowing that no charges would be brought against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughters went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in the bags and distributed them to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to react to activism in a new way.
"His activism changed completely after August 9." When he was studying at Missouri University in St. Louis, Ferrell was chairman of a minority nursing student organization, focusing on food law and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience of organization.
Somehow it just happened. "
A few weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, a deputy director of the document, in the evening show.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "wanted to simply tell" what was happening.
Ferrell's skepticism came to mind: "Do you really want to tell what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use for?"
The underlying suspicion was the countless times when people in the local community, usually white people, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and persistence.
"We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not have a common voice," Folayan recently said in an interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis, known for his activism with prisoners of death.
Davis's involvement prompted Ferrell to join the project together with six other locals. The shooting group followed the events during the years following Brown's shooting.
"This is not a document in which someone talks to us or speaks for us, but we are talking," Davis says.
"For me, the most important thing is how local people are presented in the movie, because I'm shown the same way."
According to Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experience because it was wanted to show that in the movement of folk, "it is not a charismatic leader, but a community." However, Ferrell proved to be more transparent.
That is why the document looks surprisingly private on the life of Ferrell, such as falling in love and marrying.
"I feel the time is naked," Ferrell laughs in telling how she felt to watch the movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human image of black people require a certain vulnerability."
Additionally, Ferrell's story times and reinvent the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The business was born in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had fired a black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify themselves as queer identities.
"Mustien queer-women leadership has kept the whole movement up," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight continually on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything. "
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed maintained by black women, including many queer women."
However, he emphasizes that Ferrell was not chosen for the document as "selfishly" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy to go," Folayan says.
"There is no coincidence, however, that he was in the front line. Black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot to play.
His energy is transmitted from the big screen. "
News shooters have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the ties between the community and the police are still tense.
Ferrell still has two and a half years as a candidate, and he was sentenced to blocking the motorway in the demonstration.
His description of the social-political atmosphere of his home angles is short and concise: "Blunder."
Still, he still relies on the slogan he learned from the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our chain. "
A suitable likeness: the artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York has suspended in the middle of the exhibition space faces - white, black and brown faces, between which one can see the likeness of one another.
These 30 works include portraits of artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on the DNA samples from Chelsea Manning's cheeks and hair.
Manning sent samples from the Fort Leavenworth prison where he was serving his 35-year sentence. Manning was sentenced to secretly dropping diplomatic fires on the WikiLeaks site.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance was opened on August 2, 2017.
Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work, Manning is a transnational and groundbreaking dissident who was barred by Barack Obama's detention on the third day of his term.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, though somewhat theoretical, statement of the DNA-data editing, ambiguity and the cause-and-effect relationships underlying the interpretations and identity.
Chelsea Manning, whose birth name is Bradley Edward, has been openly told that she has been identified as a woman since adolescence. In 2013, she was found guilty of 20 offenses, including spamming, computer fraud and theft.
Manning, sentenced to imprisonment, had only one image: a granular, black and white selfie in which the bothered man Manning sits in the car on the driver's seat, with a platinum wig wearing a mark on his head.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a great popularity in the Stranger Visions project, which he implemented in 2012.
There he created portraits based on forensic information, and he received DNA information, for example, about cigarette smoking and chewing gum, and created pictures of how the people in question could have looked.
The artist then received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture," Dewey-Hagborg told a new show at a news conference.
Manning could not be visited and could not be shot in prison, so the newspaper contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in making Manning a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned mistress came suddenly to correspondents, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even made a Suppressed Images booklet by Shoili Kanungo, describing the future in which the president would have mitigated Chelsea's judgment and he would be able to watch the show.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning's judgment just a few days after the release of a comic book, which was a lucky coincidence after seven hefty years in a Kansas military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened right now as Donald Trump runs his own war against information producers and transgendered soldiers and invented on Twitter new ways to strengthen the powerful divisions that he was actually suppressing.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has its purpose".
On the wall of the gallery there is an artist's statement, and below it is a great manuscript of Manning, in which the heart of the last name is I. In his opinion, the artist demands an end to the "automatic division of gender, race, sexuality and culture".
The opposite wall has a Manning DNA sequence: a long pencil, C, G and A, written in a pencil.
This 200-liter or nucleotide, like the scientific definition used by the artist, is a combination of Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how we are all alike, at least in our biology.
"I hope my show will help people understand that we have a genetic heritage that is of the same value and that gene information is very personal and open to interpretations," says Dewey-Hagborg, who also exhibits his 2007 Spurious Memories video.
"DNA tells countless stories, here are some of them 30."
The last work of the exhibition is in his own room: a page from the Manning and Dewey-Hagborg comic book.
In it Manning's character rises to prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they get you down, they've won," the picture says.
"Never be silent."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," the artist from Philadelphia tells.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold colors."
Unlike in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the show. When Manning comes in, he greets his face based on his own genetic knowledge as a crowd of protesters in the middle of the showroom.
It's intentional, just like everyone else in this show: for example, the DNA section of Manning is written with a pencil to the height that is the same as its length (157.5 cm).
"The faces were on the wall earlier, but I wanted to bring a sense of humor to them," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to describe the Chelsea-born public service, which was also behind her release."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff are being searched for suspected murders
The police say they have launched nationwide searches to find a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man in Chicago's luxury home.
It is apparent from the files of the Cook County court that warrants were issued on Monday from Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau. The arrest warrants were issued in first degree murder without the possibility of being released.
According to documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local bulletin published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on 27 July 2017.
Police officers alerted to the Grand Plaza room building found a victim with multiple cuts in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the venue and stabbing was investigated as a murder. Police are actively seeking two suspects.
Lathem has worked as Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Senior Vice President for Corporate Relations, stated in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now free of charge and has been denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case investigated by the authorities, and the Northwestern University helps investigate," Cubbage wrote.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
The statement by e-mail sent by a spokesperson for the University and the Somerville College states that "we have been in contact with the police in the UK and are prepared to help investigate the case in the United States in all possible ways."
In addition, the statement said that Warren's colleagues were upset and hoped he would surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of information at the Chicago Police Department, said he urged the suspects seriously to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and we constantly focus our search," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities assist in suspect searches.
He told the police that he had received a phone call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had received a vague hint of what had happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as horrible at the venue.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered the same day or earlier.
He said the security cameras had revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim have a relationship," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plateau Management Team released to the residents the following bulletin: "The police are currently investigating the course of events and the victim's background, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
The man threatened to blow up an Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic," the convict told the police.
Moffatt must spend one hundred hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced to threats to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to the Independent magazine, David Moffatt was sentenced for, among other things, aggravated harassment.
According to the police, the bookstore staff alerted them on May 23rd.
According to the staff, the man had "threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims".
Suspect left the store after threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police for threats.
The threat was not related to bookshop events.
The authorities noted that Moffatt was dressed in the same suit as a suspect in a book shop, police spokesman said.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt told the police in interviews.
As a punishment, a man must spend a hundred hours of unpaid social service and pay for £ 620 or around € 690 for legal expenses and 85 for a compensation of € 95 for the victims.
According to a Scotland Yard spokeswoman, several hate crimes are left unreported.
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Vitaly Mutko, Deputy Prime Minister of Russia
Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the actions of the World Anti-Doping Agency's WADA Roadmap to restore the RUSADA's powers to the Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
"Some of the roadmap measures have already been implemented and RUSADA was granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UKAD Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA roadmap has been updated in these respects, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap, which sets out the conditions for restoring RUSADA's mandate. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything worrying about Russia.
"Everything is announced, and everything is done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future, "Mutko added.
However, one of the points in the roadmap requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities publicly accept WADA's results from the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. McLaren examines the state's alleged role in Russian sports doping.
Mutko said, "Research is under way because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
There were no government programs, and we can not grant what did not exist. "
Mutko's words were echoes from the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of the independent Russian anti-doping committee.
Smirnov, who spoke earlier on the same day as Russian sports spokesman for RSport, admitted that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping media. "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial statements and regulations.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally, "he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015 when the scope of doping scandal was revealed.
However, in June last year, it was authorized to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA's leader Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow in July. After the visit, he said the organization was "on the right track" towards restoring powers.
Briton skeptical about love for innocent Finns: The health benefits of maternity packages "have no evidence"
The British organization doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
BBC and Guardian, among other things, say that the Lullaby Trust, who fights covert deaths, prohibits using their own brochures in Britain's distributable maternity packages.
The distribution of maternity packages for all pregnant women begins this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that maternity packaging would reduce the risk of concealment.
Cache death marks an unexplained sudden death of the baby.
Lullaby Trust is an expert in health services in the United States as a child's safe dream.
We will no longer be able to pack our official brochures for them because it would imply that we recommend this product, the organization informed.
Finland is one of the world's lowest child mortality ratings, only two dead per 1,000 births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland's good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as the low number of teenage pregnancies.
The fact that a box for each family is given there may be one factor.
However, that can not be said for sure, Francine Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust said.
We are concerned that maternity packaging is marketed as a product that reduces child mortality and cache deaths.
Maternity kit is a Finnish invention and has been delivered to Finland for all mothers for free for 80 years.
The kit includes a variety of accessories, such as children's wear.
This year, there are 53 products on the packaging.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, boxes distributed by it meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust, for its part, says that there is no security standard for cardboard boxes.
According to Lullaby Trust, packaging can be the best option for a bed if no cradle or crib is available.
The organization recommends using the package only for day naps and stop using it at the time the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping the pets out of the box and ensuring that they do not get wet or dirty.
The villainous villain ran away from the Japanese zoo
The staff of the Japanese zoo is looking for a flea turtle.
The Giant Turtle has surprised staff at its Speed and has already fired for two weeks.
The turtle vanished from Oklahoma's Shibukawa zoo in western Japan on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die right away because it is eating grass around the zoo, but we are very worried, Yoshimi Yamane, a zoo, told me.
A broken 35-year-old villain is a female, 55-pound and about a meter long.
Yamane describes the vicar as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours the villa must be allowed to travel freely within the shelter area.
The zoo has not received eyeglasses from the turtle.
The last jumper of the knock happened last week.
Yamane found the jumper walking along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed her traveling to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked for help from my colleagues, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your business avoid Uber errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure employees' satisfaction with their e-commerce startup business, but queries did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured that the queries were anonymous, some of the employees were suspicious of them.
"The surveys were simply not consistent and not objective," says Errett, whose hair care company Madison Reed focuses on e-commerce, with 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside assistance.
There are more and more new kinds of human resource startups that help other companies find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement. Companies can query and target them to specific teams and population groups, and provide their employees with anonymous reporting services and in some cases direct contact with senior management over the board.
"Your own health can be followed by applications like Strava and Fitbit, but where do companies sit Fitbit?" Inquires Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint's startup company in Redwood City, Glint provides companies with analytical software for employee commitment measurement.
Errett has been using Glint software for three years and says he has got a more in-depth view of the employees' ideas and feelings.
With this program, you can make quick queries and polls for specific teams, and you can create a map that sees at a glance what departments are the most dissatisfied and who has the lowest ratings on the board, which has led to the drilling of Errett.
Businesses have realized that they have to follow the workplace culture so that they do not come from the next Uberia. Around the transport company has been frightened since the former employee wrote in his blog about cultures where workers are being harassed and people who are problematic are being punished.
For such beginners as Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate Governance, Regulatory Compliance and Conformity are a worldwide industry that, according to the Let's Talk Payments website, will rise to more than $ 118.7 billion by 2020.
In Denver, Colorado, Convercent is a start-up that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate use. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation was felt.
Convercenti has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently signed an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent gives businesses the ability to make customized queries, gather responses in confidence in real time, and map out problem areas.
In addition, employees can report anonymous behavior anonymously by SMS.
And if the leader has any reason to suspect the wrongdoing, complaints will go directly to the company's board.
"Public opinion has been displaced by the authorities," says Convercent's founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences may become expensive even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company and may also lose employees and be prosecuted.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations and has been using Convercent for more than a year as it seeks to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and easily access the head office.
Previously, it was a practice that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find out a telephone number or email address that was able to report to the headquarters. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope to take it seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, General Counsel of Ruby Tuesday, who finds it hard to keep track of complaints made by employees.
Previously, problems remained hidden from leaders in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and handled more quickly.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive view of the employee's reality," says Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from legal proceedings related to employment."
According to Quinlan, companies began to look to ethics, values and employee commitment more seriously after the auditing company Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical operations in connection with the Enron scandal.
Only through social media companies realized that they could no longer block public disclosure of their likes.
"Hope was used as a strategy before the technology came under the control of ethics," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service whose use is charged on a regular basis.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by venture capitalists. Both Glint and Convercent are backed by venture capitalists.
In February, Convercent collected $ 10 million in funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised a total of $ 47 million in capital.
Glint received € 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised funding totaling $ 60 million.
Investments are not a surprise given the connections between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their workplaces.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good salaries, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a genuinely useful company.
"Employees are more committed to the company's success if they are comfortable with the company and feel they are listened to and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, Senior Vice President, LinkedIn, for employee reward and well-being.
Investors get a profit when companies succeed. Businesses thrive when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it's no wonder that they are interested in investors.
According to experts in the workplace culture, knowledge of employee engagement is important,
but it is useless if it does not take action.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered a sign of change.
And if change does not go fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for four thousand suggestions, you have to be prepared to have four thousand conversations," says CEO Russell Raath, CEO of Kotter International, which has seen companies rely too much on merely collecting data.
"If the company does not take action, employees will start thinking about whether they came to hearing it
and whether their opinions matter anyway.
If the company does not care about them, why should they care about the business? "
According to Errett, Madison Reed currently does staff surveys on a monthly basis and is able to deal with the problem the same day as it is reported to Glint.
When Errett had gathered feedback on the slow pace of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated employees, he was able to make changes to teams and arrange communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help improve long-term employee sustainability in the industry known as the large turnover of employees.
"If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers there are no businesses. "
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of hiding his naked ladyfriend, according to a news agency TT.
The woman in Gothenburg had come home from the shower when she had noticed outside of her window the phone hanging at the end of the string.
According to her, the cell phone camera shot at the apartment.
From the case, the frightened woman had run in another room to dress.
When a woman had come to check the situation, her cell phone was first pulled up, but soon afterwards she was resurfaced.
The 20-year-old man suspected of seizure has admitted admitting to a woman.
He claimed, however, that he had just depicted the woman's face.
The mobile video was deleted and the police had failed to return it as proof.
In a hearing, a man has admitted to a crime but denied committing a crime.
He described the man as saying that he loves his neighbor "just crazy".
According to TT, a prosecution for a man is brought against him.
Teachers demand more money during the autumn negotiations
Wage growth can not be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the gap should be narrowed, said OAJ Chairman Olli Luukkainen on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holidays emphasizes the difference, he points out.
We do not have the possibility to conclude agreements that do not have some kind of involvement in the review.
In the municipal sector, contracts will only arise when private sector papers have been signed and the rate of increase is clear.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, OAJ's working conditions have been agreed in January.
Percentage targets Luukkainen has not yet revealed.
Luukainen is also the chairman of the public education training organization Juko.
Luukkainen: Lomarahalaikkaus increases earnings development differences
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of wage-earners in the public sector will deteriorate, while at the same time the private purchasing power is increasing.
According to Luukkainen, temporary holiday cut-off will further improve earnings development.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many pupils per teacher can be
OAJ also points out that the equality of basic education must be ensured, as differences between the best and the weakest are growing all the time.
According to the organization, learning outcomes are deteriorating, and differences between pupils and regions are growing steadily.
The Bruins players' day was extended when NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one
The clock is about eleven o'clock in the evening. A group of UCLA's American football players have been caught on the other side of the campus's new training camps.
Some have taken off their play, and their backs are shining after the first day of training at the training camp.
The time for many of them this few minutes of chatting is a noon break.
After a three-hour training session, students returning to the dormitory will return to the dormitory to read the final exam. The following morning, they will meet at seven of the seven Wasserman football clubs.
"The next three days are coming tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora says a bit before Monday's change to Tuesday.
The umbrella organization of the University of Sports reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one, the purpose of which was to lighten the workload of the players, but extended their day - at least until Friday, when the last final exams are held.
That's why UCLA's first three exercises started over seven in the evening, and it was difficult for players to find space even in full-time schedules.
Limiting the number of training sessions in one day means more training days than before. The camp started this year almost a week earlier than last year and this is the first time in Morava's six-year Westwood traineeship when exercises are held at the same time as summer classes.
Exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20th, when the actual preparation for the season opening match begins: UCLA will meet at Texas A & M University in September.
Mora says he has backed the NCAA rule change, even though it made the players' timetables even stricter.
"We load them a lot for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work, they are cool guys.
I think the situation will be easier when we get to Saturday, then we have more time.
UCLA closes the training sessions outside the camp, which is not easy considering the direct view of the training camps to the adjacent parking area and Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been bombarded with football flying over the protective net behind the goal post.
The Bruins players are about to change the hotel for the coming weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are available to third parties.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"It is a concern that people can book a room and describe the exercises for the video there. It is not an exaggerated concern.
A lot of paid video is spent on the exercises.
But we have guards there and in the car park.
We do our best.
I'm not going to bother my head over that.
We have a plan. "
Freedom to Rwanda
In Rwanda, Middle Africa, presidential elections are held on Friday, the winner of which is already clear.
Paul Kagame officially pursues his third term, but in practice he has been influencing the country since 1994.
Then the rebel group RPF stopped the genocide organized by extremists.
Kagame was RPF commander.
Kagame has been criticized, among other things, for crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of speech.
He has also been accused of misrepresentation, for example, of poverty statistics.
For the third term, Kagame can strive for a change in the constitution that has been limited to two seasons of the presidency.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a truly respected leader.
During his time in Rwanda, social reforms have been made and international investments have taken place.
In addition, Kagamella has played a major role in combining the nation of genocide.
Rwanda's success has prompted many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagamek has pledged more freedom to his people after land has been lifted to his feet.
Now, it might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights against news releases by stepping up the checking of facts
Facebook is planning to send potential vouchers more and more to independent fact-finding inspectors, as well as presenting the results under the original article, and the world's largest social network reported on Thursday.
The company published on its website an opinion that it will start using up-to-date machine learning to detect fraudulent reports. Possible false reports will be sent to factual inspectors and results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest vowel distributors, and many believe that the revelations affected the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The topic has risen to a political debate in Europe where French voters were bombarded in the vowels before the May presidential election and Germany preparing for the September elections supports the plan for the fines of social media networks if they do not remove hateful content quickly.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement in Germany that testing of facts is being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories do not pass through independent screeners, and they want more background information so they can decide more about what they read and share," Sara Su, Product Manager at Facebook's news feed, wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing the Related Articles feature and will also make other changes to its news feeds in order to reduce the rating.
The birth of a comic book: The story of a castle
The small Scotne Castle in County Kiln is now known as Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hiding place in the 1970s and 1980s.
It has, however, 700 years of stormy history behind it. Now this charming spot in the Bewl River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a mummified writer with old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to study texts written by a dead person more than 300 years ago," says Rhodes loudly.
"I know a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
The story of Rhodes's book, A Castle in England, tells the story of the families of Scotney-inhabited families from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era, each portrayed by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes's first book-based book, and in 2014 he was released from Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, whose sources of inspiration were the documents of the British National Library, and the project was emotional.
"I was in tears to notice the thumbprint in a letter, which was written by a twin agent working on sharing cameras in the 18th century," says Rhodes.
"It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell of smoke, because at that time light was used.
Three centuries later, the fragrance will let the reader know that he is on the spot.
I love archives! "
The old writer, who was drawn to old documents, was able to live in the castle for nearly four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Council of England, which seemed too good to be true, and admits that he did not want to be in the castle for a little longer than would have been hopeless.
He spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures, and rarity, such as walls hung on the walls and bottles of centuries-old moonlight.
He circled the old castle with ruins and fences and talked with forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes even with illustrative artists.
In the evenings, he "took the whiskey and started writing".
The closer to Scotne's history is quite unknown because the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust until the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes came to the scene ten years later, the staff of the Foundation was just about to start exploring the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: by taking all the extra into the attic.
The archives included diaries, letters from the English Empire and maps of who owned what. "It could be imagined that land dispute is tedious," Rhodes says. "Here, however, the families fought up to one birch tree.
It came to my mind that I suppose it should already be. "
Some of the book's stories go from the castle to English history, like The Labourer, which tells about a man who soon joined the castle in England in 1381 after the castle was completed.
"The Knightly Families of Kent and the Sussex book mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," says Rhodes.
"The British peasantry started in the same area, and recalled that the rebellion might start in the riot.
Perhaps these events are related? "
The other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle - like The Priest, a story of a priest who was hidden by the Darrell family seven years during the Reformation of England.
The Smuggler tells the story of the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, who is said to have stoned his own funeral by filling the coffin with rocks (it was noticed many years later when his grave was opened).
Darrells are the favorite family of Rhodes in Scotney. "The men of the family seem to be quite a hijab, they were constantly in debt and bought things they could not afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I saw them as handsome friends who were able to banish the perpetrators. "
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book from Elämänmäen, a healer in the early twentieth century, with only eutrophication left over.
The Scotne Castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave," he says.
"I would not have wanted to go back to this bad day's life."
You were the worst in Russia since the Cold War
Military Federation between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, comments NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia of its position and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in a CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could strive for close co-operation with Russia.
But, particularly after the unlawful attachment of Crimea in 2014 and continuing instability in Russia in eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to working so that tensions do not get stuck.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage with Russia in political dialogue to avoid an escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump found that the US-Russia route had drifted even to a dangerous level.
Trump urged to congratulate the congressional countries for the bad news, which last week approved new anti-Russian sanctions.
Vladimir Klitshko finishes - a repeat match against Anthony Joshua will not materialize
The long-awaited heavyweight champion Vladimir Klitshko will end his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
At the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, Gold hit Klitshko as a professional 69 times, winning 64 matches.
He was in possession of various World Championships in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost the last two matches in his career.
Tyson Fury hit him in points in November 2015.
In April this year Klitshko met at Wembley stadium Anthony Joshua and lost after a fierce match at knockout in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to face a replay in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko did not find the motivation for the match.
I used a few weeks to make a decision to get enough distance to the Wembleyn match, Klitshko told reporters.
I got amateur and professional boxer for everything I dreamed of and now I want to start my second career after the sport.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful.
See Klitshko's reasons for deciding on a video.
Klitshko manager Bernd Bönte told the press that the decision to terminate was difficult for Klitshk.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he has not enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating since 2009 with US actor Hayden Panettiere.
The couple have one child, daughter Kaya born in 2014.
Klitshko's big brother Vitali is also a former Heavyweight World Champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated the league titles of different federations at the same time.
Finnish weathermaker wakes up the conditions: "Take a look"
Hockey Leader Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the summer's outdoor jubilee season.
Minna Nikkasa has had problems with the circumstances.
Wind and cold have taken a woman's flair.
The London World Championships also have unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
The weather has been a sting for a stroller from Minna Nikki.
I would not want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I did not even get small stumps to move properly, Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I've been competing and practicing here how many times I have never experienced the same breeze in this place, Nikkanen told Paavo Nurminen Games.
During this season, the standardization of the jump has been very difficult, as the exercises have had such unstable winds, Nikkanen stated in Kaleva's competitions.
The weather also spoke in London on Thursday.
The time has been challenging to get the technology up - whether it's cold drift or what.
It has been cold and windy, and it has been a pleasure.
It makes no sense to consume energy in bad conditions.
He was able to take part in World Cup races by 455.
Outside has gone 445.
The condition is not the same in London.
Must be tense and expect better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 on Friday.
Why not train abroad?
It is not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got hopped up and the technology was standardized.
You should have done the same now.
Normally, he has managed to practice, now the hall has been closed.
What would be a great race for?
25 degrees warm.
Small winds are running as long as it is standard.
Experienced ex-policeman urged politicians on Top: "We have no dividing line now and not for many years"
Despite the positive climate in the economy, Juha Sipilä's government must keep the ice in the hat and beware of the expansion of the state budget with debt, warns Erkki Virtanen of the Ministry of Finance for decades preparing for the budgets.
According to him, there is no dividing line.
Yle interviewed the Virtana retired in 2015 in Wednesday's Ykköshamo.
State budget next year's budget is just about to start.
Recently voiced by politicians' proposals about the raising of a guarantee pension, the reduction of the tax on cars and the support of electric wheels, Virtanen is considered as a clamor.
They mostly tell us that the elections are about to be close, because when ten percent of the state budget is funded by additional debt, we have no dividend for now and not for many years.
I think it's even a deception to talk about dividend when debt is taken, Virtanen told Ylelle.
Virtanen emphasized that all debt owes children.
Virtasella has long experience in preparing state budgets: in 1978 he started as secretary of finance at the Ministry of Finance and later worked as Deputy Head of the Budget Department and as Head of Budget.
The last time he retired he served as the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
Virtanen pointed out in YLE's interview that the projected 3 per cent economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is a spike, starting next year to go downhill, and Finland is expecting a one percent growth for several decades.
Washington changes the rules of a permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump stated that the rules of the permanent residence card, the Green Card, will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the President.
The draft law is due to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises salaries and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residents grant their citizenship to other countries.
It also reduces chaotic migration and replaces the current program.
The new recruiting process will benefit from applicants who know English and are able to sustain themselves and have the skills that are beneficial to our economy, "Trump said according to the media.
The spouse of the Queen of Denmark does not want to be buried with the Queen at the same place
Prince Henrik does not want to be buried with Queen Margareeta.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margareeta depicted in April.
Danish Queen Margareeta, 77, and his spouse, Prince Henrik, 83, do not bury each other, says Danish Hovi.
Traditionally, the ruling couple in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
Queenstown has today announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Roskilde cathedral, Hovi says in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the dissatisfaction of the prince in his roles in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, commented Lene Belleby, Communications Manager, in the journal.
The prince's decision not to bury him alongside a queen is a natural consequence of not treating him equally with his spouse.
According to Hov, the queen has long been aware of the wishes of her spouse's burial place and understands the decision.
Horror on the Road: The car was on the highway
Tommi had an unmarried partner and two small children.
They did not get injured in the accident, but they will not get the insurance money if the other party can not be reached.
The crowd took place at Keimolanportti in Vantaa.
Archives of the Ring Road III construction site.
Vantaa Tommi says his family survived on Tuesday with a miracle deal in a car accident.
Tommi, his unmarried partner, Riina, and two small children of the couple drove on the motorway at Keimolanportti, Vantaa, in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
From the Ring III ring to Hämeenlinna, a white car was driving along the acceleration band, which was driving on the side of a family car, Tommi explains.
Without the forbearance, the car would have come on top of Tom.
I brake and turned the car at the same time, and it went out of control, Tommi says.
The family car collided at a high speed with the railing.
The parents and the two little children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is slightly under 3 years old, one under one year old.
It was a pretty good time when we did nothing.
No one of us had ever driven us even though there was lively traffic.
The accident happened around 17.20.
According to Tommi, nobody stopped at them, and the family called the Emergency Response Center.
They got their own way out of the car.
Ambulance and emergency rescue staff came in, and the condition of the family was checked.
The car went to redemption.
Tommi tells her and the spouse that she has a small income, and they got help from the family for a car purchase a couple of years ago.
Without a second car information, a family can not get cash for insurance under Tomm.
That's why the family hopes for eyewitnesses about the car that caused the family to ride on the railing.
We need a car every day.
It is difficult to take the children to the orchard and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw the car was a white, old-fashioned car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
In his opinion, the start of the car's registration number was SIG.
If the culprit can not be caught, I do not know how to do so economically, we have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that something happened or something they know is connected with the police.
The East Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department are confirmed to have been on a Tuesday night at an accident site.
The title and the thing were corrected at 21.15: Unlike the story originally reported, another car did not come from the upcoming lanes but had to drive from the acceleration band to the side of the family car.
Lotta Jäppinen's performance discusses human relationships with humor - Self-detector is seen in the What? Theater on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, who comes from Kouvola, brings her first guitar to the What?
A self-detector is a musical theater show of past relationships and inadequacy.
According to Lotta Jäppinen, however, it is still a good idea.
The subject is dealt with by humor.
It will not be a long time for the old feelings, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the revolving summer theater performance has been implemented with a small budget and a big, young heart.
The name of the performance challenges to reflect on what a man reveals about himself when he is exploring a new person.
Does he perhaps have a role to play or is he approaching another coat open?
The unfettered presentation mixes fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatized the performance.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group and does not have a plot.
The director believes that even though the presentation draws on the ideas of young people, it speaks to people of all ages.
Jake emphasizes that Self-Detector does not directly tell about her or her working relationships.
Fact and fiction blend.
My own values will surely be transmitted from the show.
I do not think that human relationships are bad, but I also do not think that interpersonal relationships, especially relationships, would be a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn about divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that Self-Detector draws up a current image of young adults living in Finland for centuries.
According to him, many have learned a lot from their relationship with their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
There is no need to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance is performed by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes Costume Designer Ella Snellman.
The arrangement of music is Jäppinen and Rokan.
Love in theater came to light in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola, 26, studies as a director of theater at Turku Polytechnic's Art Academy.
There are two years behind and another Mokoma.
Jäppinen's enthusiasm for theater has begun during the Kouvolan years.
He has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theater and has performed at the Ylioppilasteatteri in Helsinki and last in the Linnateatteri in Turku.
Managing has become more and more interested.
The self-detector got its premiere last week in Helsinki on the stage of Narr.
A 45-minute presentation will be seen in the future, at least in Jäppinen City, Turku.
Self-detector at Kouvola What's a Theater on Aug. 4, 19 and August 5 at 14 and 19.
The Finnish Olympic champion recovered for a year after a horrible motorcycle accident - a culinary wound broke
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable nature as Janne Lahtela.
The crotch ace circled the world for hundreds of days a year for twenty years and chased his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtela's business continued.
He was not only an impatient trainee, but also an experiment for new species.
There are not many forms of exercise on Earth that the chemist would not have tried at least once.
It has inspired you to practice.
Everything is always something new, Lahtela says.
Finally, one of the hobbies was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014 Lahtela got into a motocross accident.
As a result, his necklines and both hands broke.
I was not in any job.
I swallow wounds in my home for a year, "Lahtela says.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that he could play a part of his time.
Pretty driving can sound like a buzz.
But I did not apply for that.
It's just so hard that it's not too much for those in the forties to do that!
After the accident, Lahtela got into a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
On the back was a long hoarse as the head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela began her pussy immediately after her career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15 years old, I was in my place.
I really did not do anything, Lahtela says.
During his coaching career, Lahtela often challenged his guard on slopes and in physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so tired that my thoughts did not seem sensible either.
Not even with the species.
Made good being in place.
I really enjoyed it because I really just did not get it.
Mandatory break for the Lahtela Finnish Head Coach.
Without stopping, she fears that it would have come to an end.
It is easier for Kropasta to find places that have gone beyond the intact!
Without an accident I would not have realized that I needed to rest so much.
Lahtela started the Finnish freestyle team coach about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby in place of the float types.
I changed motocross to frisbeegolfi!
It just left a mole immediately.
At worst, I was seven hours a day throwing herself.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-skilled trainer, she does not require the coaches to be the same as her.
I do not force everyone into the same mold.
In our varietal culture there is room to be unique and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been in line, Lahtela says.
Sex robots come and we have to worry about it
It's here: a report on technological advances in the sex robot industry - just as it started to look like the year 2017 could no longer become stranger.
Yes, only.
Sex robots are now a big deal.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within the next 5-10 years.
"We must start to take a serious look at the popularization of sex robots," says Foundation founder and Robotics and Artificial Intelligence professor Noel Sharkey of Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the fingernail type of the robot.
"Sex robots are slammed, but they are already sold quite a lot, and we will see them more and more," Sharkey said at the announcement of the report.
Sexcuts have evolved from inflatable dolls into robots with warm-looking silicone skin and artificial intelligence that resemble humans.
The user can also customize the robot's own preferences from eye color to nipple shape and fingernail type and color.
Even more worrying is that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look like advanced freedom fighters.
Sexcups have developed into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the features of the RealBotix robot can be tailored to the user's preferences, for example.
True Companion's Roxxxy Gold robot has a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah works hard, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"The personality of Roxxxy Gold adapts as perfectly as possible to the personality of the user," the company's website is advertised.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
it may be tired, whether it is a mood or a mood.
There are many disturbing features in the popularization of sex robots, replacing genuine human relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjection of women and direct rape fantasies when a user approaches, for example, a shy and oppressive programmed robot.
True Companion compares its Roxxxy robot to its vibrator:
"Women have a Vibrator. Why not have sex with sex robots?"
Sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toys.
Their upbringing and development tells us something darker and deeper in our culture: the recession of gender equality towards sexual engagement, where subjection is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not have sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report says they are growing in popularity.
Marginal phenomena, however, tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And many will start to behave strangely or insultingly only when the market permits.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have begun to become more common at the same time as women's rights are threatened around the world and the White House is sitting on a president who has bragged about the oppressed women.
In the television series, The Handmaid's Tale (Orjattaresi) is not the worst thing about its powerful imagery, such as pictures of a lumpy body and out of the drenched eyes. The most annoying thing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
We try to make sex robots so much like real women (pornographic proportions) as technically feasible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and the motions imitate as much human movement as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot can not get away from the relationship or situation.
They do not have their own will or history - there is nothing to contradict the imagination of self-reliance or complete submissiveness.
They are nice servants.
Orjattaria.
Police suspect: two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, headed by Isis
The Awesome Organization Isis led a group of Australasian men suspected of planning to take a bomb on an Etihad Airways airliner.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a person belonging to the most famous leaders also sent bombs to Sydney.
According to suspicions, the bomb was supposed to be put on air on July 15, but the company was suspended before security checks.
The police will not tell you why the company was interrupted.
Another suspect terrorist plan was to build a poisonous colorless gas separator and take the device to the top of a public place, such as public transport.
Australian Federal Deputy Commander Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to the suspected terrorist plans, four men were detained in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but her examinations will continue.
Trump's Good Side?
Make Mitt Romney look like a hell of a good reason
The Trump season has been repeated until saturation, that the powerful division of voters has, at daily level, also broken families.
On Christmas and Thanksgiving, the American newspapers' helpdesk palettes showed how Trump's relatives will be working.
We all want to pierce our information bubble.
Less attention has been given to Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm telling this because my cousin had a village this week in New York with me. He is a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has long been banging our fellow Republicans with us.
He recalled that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousin, all the acquaintances - including a republished sibling with whom he has been controversial for decades - are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At a dinner table it is a good thing, but in broader terms, it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new stream, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually bring us all right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we are talking about the scary possibility that one day we will not be able to shake his tricks.
In the long run, it is even more horrible for Trump to normalize the right-wing Republicans who, when compared to Trumpi, suddenly seem sensible.
I have a slight twist on Mitt Romney's low-key version of madness: a dog on the roof of the car, a 14% income tax (and we have seen her tax return).
When Trump's season is over, the next Republican nominee in the Republicans needs to be just plain-minded, and it feels like a major improvement now.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the Central Park Carousel, which is the largest carousel in the New York City Park and the best that New York gets for three dollars without caffeine.
The carousel's horses are huge, middle-figure characters - scumbags clowns and animals watching behind the horror - are evil, and the underlying brilliant music is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York's emblems become dazzling over time: the outlook on tall buildings starts to get tired, the silhouette of the city becomes too familiar and the city's reality does not match dreams.
And yet after 35 years, it has not been completely overwhelmed by the fact that the Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large roundabout in Northern London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss pub but it is not counted.
The carousel of the Central Park, on the other hand, is still a strange magical experience - even to the extent that two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old, and two forty-four women enjoy it enormously.
I would have given full marks to the carousel if someone had asked for my opinion, but fortunately no one came to ask.
Instead, I was asked this week at the department store to evaluate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I placed my credit card on the reader.
The same thing in my cafe at home, but I'm also given the opportunity to combine an estimate of a 15% service fee when I go to the coffee shop itself.
This slows down the everyday interaction and exasperates the customer server to put their characters in the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The department store salesman smiled annoyedly when I gave tiredly five stars to my credit card experience experience.
Shefki Kuqi fired from Inter - "There was no management confidence"
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuqi from the club's representative's team's role.
Fabrizio Piccareta, former assistant coach, has been coached by the coach.
Another coaching team will continue in its current positions.
The Italian Piccareta has worked as an assistant coach in Sunderland, for example.
In January, the 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined the Inter training group, has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan Håkans, chairman of FC Inter's board of directors regretted the incident.
Changing the coach is never easy or pleasant to do.
Shefki Kuqi, however, was no longer in the club's management's confidence, so no alternative was available, Håkans commented in the club's press release.
The Piccarta contract is valid until the end of the season.
He is, together with another coaching team, responsible for tomorrow's home game against HIFK.
According to Ilta-Sanomat, the team is thrilled on Thursday.
On Thursday morning, Kuqi told the players that the club's assistant coaches, Piccareta and John Allen, were moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta took a strong stint in Inter's match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youthful image of the 80's - would you recognize a serious violinist?
The violinist Linda Lampenius released a picture of the youth in Instagram.
Several hysterics have been added to the picture to show that the musician is in the picture the 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student.
Lampenius, too, is surprised by the serious young woman looking at the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he communicates.
If you do not see the picture, you can check it out here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
Just a year ago, he published a pair of images on Instagram.
In another picture he is seen 20 years ago, in the other he is posing now, as a mother of two.
In his caption, Lampenius ponders his own growth as a person and refers to eating disorders, which he suffered as a young person.
Just 20 years ago and today ...
I still look a lot like the 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to keep myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added in English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is neat.
Lampenius has spoken openly about the eating of his past years.
He was 14 years old at the hospital due to anorexia and orthoresis.
Shortly afterwards, he also became ill with bulimia, which eventually did not appear until 2006.
Healing started slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenia was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to hospital due to chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from jail to hospital.
Last year, he received hospitalization on the wounds he had wounded, which he said in prison after falling into the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder at the prosecution's appeal of the original injunction.
He slew Steenkamp's Valentine's Day early in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he had conceived his girlfriend as a night-time intruder hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again because they consider Pistorius's six-year sentence too lenient.
The prosecutor will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal will be discussed possibly this year.
If the appeal is upheld, Pistorius's sentence may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camp in Greece
Two illegally arrested Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, according to the bTV channel, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country.
The police arrested a number of suspects in Sithonia on the morning of August 1. Among the members of the camp were two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation of the case continues.
Television channel bTV says the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that it would release the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules on free camps and already give appreciable fines to all those who are camping outside the designated area.
Inspections will continue until the end of the season.
The Ministry announced that the right to impose a fine.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare in the gastrointestinal tract.
However, recent research claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may help irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an irreversible disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in the UK, causing abdominal cramps, swelling, recurrence or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps the body to develop immune cells that strengthen the intestinal resilience of the intestine.
According to research director Marco Colonna, immune cells protect the gut and make sure that the food does not hide harmful microbes enter the body.
Inflammatory cells are balanced by cells that strengthen the resilience and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, it may result in irritable bowel syndrome.
In the experiments it was found that resilience-enhancing immune cells are in mice with a specific bacteria in the intestine.
This bacterium needs tryptophan to trigger immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks for proteins.
"We discovered a link between the development of Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of tolerant cells," says Lectobacillus reuter, a part of the normal microbial intestines, "Professor Colonna says.
"The more people in the diet of mice had tryptophan, the more they had such immune cells."
If the same is true for humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan can enhance bowel tolerance and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
Investigating Resistance-Strengthening Immune Cells Doctor Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one mice group had such cells, they were not in mice of the same mice that were kept separate from the other group.
He doubted that the difference was related to the intestinal microbiomas, i.e. the normal digestive tract of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
When the mouse intestinal DNA was examined, six bacterial species were found in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were administered in a sterile environment to grown mice without intestinal microbial and non-immune cells, immune cells began to appear.
The researchers wanted to find out how the bacteria affect the immune system, they raised the Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the liquid and transferred small amounts of liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells developed into resistance-enhancing cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole 3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice diet, the number of cells increasing the tolerance increased by about 50 percent.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same resilience-strengthening cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is still not known whether tryptophan byproducts from Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects in tryptophan have been observed in susceptible bowel syndrome.
"We certainly want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the internal surfaces of the joints," Cervantes-Barragan says.
"High levels of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuteri may promote their spread."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a "nerdy" strike after an agreement with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United won a "nerdy" deal with Nemanja Matic. Midfielder debuted in Manchester United on Wednesday night with Sampdoria.
Matic, who scored 40 million pounds in Chelsea, made a 2-1 win over United in the final pre-match match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday as he defeated midfielder Paul Pogban and Andreas Pereira.
Matic was not in the best condition yet, because he was not involved in the Bluebird Asian tour before the start of the season, and he only scored 45 minutes in the field - Mourinho has to change before the Champions League begins.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence and thinking make him a nerd - he has a natural sense of football," Mourinho says.
"We help him to be ready rather than sooner."
In addition to Matic, the newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were starting to play at the Aviva stadium when Mourinho began to shuffle his starting lineup for the start of the season.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants three new players, although the club has already made "brilliant work" by acquiring three of his four best-placed players.
"Three out of four - you have to give the club some thanks," he added.
"I'm happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Volleyball players bothered Germany for two bouts
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth World Cup qualifier to Germany directly at 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German routine level in gaming is high.
Their equalization was in every sector, Finland's head coach Tapio Kangasniemi told the press release.
In the first two batches, Finland kept its opponents severely but in the third stage, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we were patiently playing and in some places aggressively enough, we were able to get involved, Kangasniemi said.
Piia Korhonen was the 14th most successful in Finland.
Three games out of four lost Finland are still on Sunday in Slovenia.
Reuters: Great jury has already sent out challenges with Trump Jr's Russia meeting
In the United States, the Great Jury has posed challenges in connection with the meeting of Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A special jury of special prosecutor Robert Mueller has already posed challenges in connection with the meeting of Donald Trump Jr and the renowned Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, of the Kremlin.
This is reported by Reuters news agency, which also confirms the information that the Wall Street Journal had announced on Thursday about gathering a large jury.
According to Reuters, a large jury has posed challenges in connection with the meeting of the well-known Veselnitska, Trump Jr and Kremlin, which was held in the middle of the US presidential election in June 2016.
There was also Paul Manafort, then Campaign Manager of Donald Trump Sr, and his son, the current White House adviser, Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a large jury in Washington marks the intensification of the Russian investigation.
The sources add that Mueller wanted a large jury to assist in investigating whether Russia was involved in the US presidential election and whether Trump's campaign or related parties cooperated with Russia.
The great jury extends Mueller's rights to gather evidence, challenge and force people to bear witness.
A great jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
A large jury will weigh the evidence that is being investigated by the prosecutor and decide whether to prosecute the case.
The British inventor chips himself to get home and his car by swinging his hand
The British inventor is the first in the country to microchip himself to open his home door, get to his office and launch his car by swinging his hand.
The microchip is between Steven North's thumb and forefinger at age 33. Now he offers service to businesses and individuals who want to make life easier with Northam's BioTeq technology.
Northam collaborates with Winchester, a consultant at the hospital of the Royal Hampshire County, Hants, at the hospital, in order to make the microchip installation meet medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technology as the microchip for cats and dogs and takes only 30 seconds to install.
The Northam company also makes the locks for houses and cars compatible with the microchip. One lock handling costs £ 300.
Northam is married and has one child. He has installed microchip technology both for his home and BMW Z4, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's final decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the White House on the southern lawns for an American production event was to pay taxpayers $ 24,000. This is evident from TIME magazine's military documents.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is referred to as the Marine One when the President is on it. It was the main attraction at the White House on 17 July 2017, where American building programs were introduced.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and a number of White House officials were introduced to products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter in Connecticut, the show included a sailboat from Main, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office had asked for a helicopter on the site by a task-specific order just about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn's "extraordinary" event, as evidenced by the HMX-1 helicopter ship documents.
"I just wanted to make sure that you are aware of it because it is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the day before the event in his email to his superiors who is a naval contender for naval operations.
The message was that the helicopter would arrive on the southern lawn on July 17 at seven o'clock in the morning and the event would start at three o'clock in the afternoon, after which the helicopter would leave only after the grass field was cleared in the evening between six and nine.
In addition, the message mentioned that if a helicopter flight from the White House was delayed, another crew would be needed for the service due to limitations in service hours.
The original crew was on a helicopter for the time of the event, and the unit's security staff was at the helicopter when it was in the country.
Documents received from the TIME magazine are unclear whether a second crew was needed.
The US Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using State property for political purposes.
According to documents, the HMX-1 inquired whether the law was violating the law.
"One of our questions was whether there was any breach of the Hatch Act. We were told not to break," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the deputy lieutenant replied.
Made in America was an official event in the White House, so it was not part of the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political tones.
At that time, the President spoke at the time about the health reform in the Senate reading and the looser state regulation.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and the Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their journeys,
but their use for photographs is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled the President's campaign campaign in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of its predecessor's presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which featured American products manufactured by American workers from all over the 50 states," said White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crew members regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and practice on the southern lawn to bring the president into the White House with centimeter accuracy.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training dives at the White House.
One official said flights to the Made in America event were part of the monthly training quota for the crew.
On that day, helicopters also flown 11 hours on "non-presidential support missions".
According to the White House, no other expenses were incurred by the taxpayer.
Sikorsky's spokesman reported that the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter demonstration on the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have accounts for flights to President's duties, and it is difficult to accurately assess the cost of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defense's 2017 hourly compensation, the VH-3D helicopter's compensation level is $ 24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 documents, flights from the Quantico base to the White House from Virginian State and back lasted for an hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are clearly lower.
"The calculation of the costs to taxpayers by the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs that are taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a survey conducted by the RAND research firm in 2015, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, the former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that the Sikorsky and Connecticut states are very proud of their involvement in securing national security and employing hundreds of thousands or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans have been working hard for.
It is perfectly reasonable to point out. "
It is not certain whether Trump was on a helicopter during the event, but at least he hit the fire truck driver.
In a white house, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have the three."

The Venezuelan State Prosecutor demands the right to prevent the appointment of a new National Assembly
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor has applied for a court ruling preventing the appointment of a new National Assembly.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the assembly elected last Sunday's vote will be scheduled on Friday.
In the controversial vote, a representative body was elected to the country, which could, for example, change the constitution of the country.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the arrest decision has been requested due to suspected electoral fraud.
Ortega has also started electoral polls for the vote.
He appointed two judges for the post after a British company organized by a representative poll told reporters that the results were manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million more than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated for the representative office, and the elected 545-member council included Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to altering the constitution, the parliamentary committee may break up the opposition-led congress and amend the laws.
Maduroa described as a dictator
Maduro's actions are widely condemned.
The opposition considers modifying the constitution as a means of strengthening Maduro's position.
The United States has imposed on Maduro sanctions and called it a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have stated that they do not recognize a new constituency.
Maduro argues that the new constituency is a solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, the unrest has continued for months.
There are numerous people wounded and over a hundred have died.
Venezuela fell into an economic crisis as the oil price dropped.
Now many people can not afford food or medicines.
Opposition is also expected to point out on Friday when the new parliamentary assembly is due to begin.
The Russian donated by Finland was sentenced to 4 years in jail in the United States
The Minneapolis Court in the United States on Thursday sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senah to nearly four years in prison for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of US demand.
According to Russian magazine Fontanka, Senah had been in vacation in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was returning home.
Finland handed Senah to US judicial authorities in February 2016 despite Russian protests, AFP says.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah got 46 months in prison.
According to the US Department of Justice, Senah is expelled from the country after the execution of the prison sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry repeatedly criticized Finland for arrest and said no man should be released into the United States.
In the statement, Finland and the United States were accused of the arrest in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had been using a computer virus called Ebury, which was infected with dozens of thousands of computers around the world.
Using the virus, usernames and passwords were fired.
Cheaters then used data by further controlling internet traffic by making click fraud and spreading spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, Director of the Criminal Justice Directorate of Justice, the case shows that the United States is also able to chase other cybercriminals.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco told the press release.
Modified at 20.58: Corrected littering of the sentenced person.

Timo Soin wrote a question mark with the question: "Then came the flood"
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (uv.) On Thursday published a blog post that is headed by a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences long.
In my time the party grew from one to thirty-seven MPs.

Depending on the interpretation, the books of history have left the quotes "after us the flood" or "after me the flood".
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
Elections are representative only if they can vote for all members of society, including women, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the provisional leader of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan, said that hundreds of women are eligible for election in the provincial councils, three women seek vice president and over 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"Women's role can not be overemphasized," Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can be genuinely representative and credible only if women are fully involved and included in all parts of the electoral process.
The provincial council and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has presented threats to the election at the same time as international troops are moving to an advisory role.
This year's elections are the first time that power moves peacefully from a democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women's contribution strengthens Afghanistan's democracy.
According to the Independent Election Commission in Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

The flood of certain types of tourists is a threat to the region's culture
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly concerned with the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it a "eat and flee" tour: there is only a few hours in the city and the big crowds are traversed.
Venice is suppressing quick day trips to tourists to the city.
In narrow streets it is difficult to move, and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice will no longer be fit.
They are forced to move further away from the historic center while homes have been replaced by hotels.
The problems brought by tourism in Venice are written by The New York Times and The Guardian.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist volumes.
They call the present phenomenon as low-quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, the time is two or three hours.
You follow a flag-bearing guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and you turn back, describes the dominant and troublesome tourism of Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only about architecture, but also about the place, the shops and the workshops.
We have to keep this part of the city's identity.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most visited places in the historic center of Venice.
The St. Mark's Church is on the edge of the market.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
There are no more than 50,000 local residents in the historic center of Venice.
In 1951 there were about 175 000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians protested against mass-protestism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment, and drives people away.
Approximately 2,000 people leave each year.
If that continues, a few years after Venice is no more than tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical catastrophe, says Carlo Belframe, the organizer of the demonstration.
The equation is difficult because the ships bring in Venice the earnings they need and create the need for numerous jobs in the various sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, a solution has been envisaged that cruisers would go a long way from the historical center.
According to Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, the situation would surely change if the Venetian administrative area, where Venetia is located, would have more power to decide on their own affairs - unless full autonomy.
Every year around 20-30 million tourists visit Venice.

I will do well without such attention
The 23-year-old runner has had to find out what the public has been up against.
Amalie Iuel has released stunning images of himself, including the Grand Canyon landscape.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in Norway in his current home country, not least because he broke 26-year-old Norway's record in the 400-meter race in March by rounding off the round trip at 51.81.
A month later he improved the 400 meter hurdle at the time of Norway's record at 55.38.
Carefully, social media Iuel soon afterwards noted that fame and publicity have a shadow.
Men all over the world began to send Iuelle genitalia images apparently in the hope that a young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel had to close his Snapchat account from outsiders.
I got a lot of "bad guys" from unknown people, so I had to change my account private, Iuel told the VG magazine.
In his interview with VG, Iuel did not want to accurately identify what kind of images he was getting.
You probably guess Iuel laughs.
It's nice to get feedback after running, but I'll be fine without any other kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, Dad Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalia was 2 years old.
Amalia's 12-year-old family moved first to Namibia, then to Pakistan, because of her father's job.
After that, they were in Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
IUIT spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, she changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is trained by three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warhol and Elisabeth Slettum.
In Norway, we are much more open to discuss than in the United States.
In the United States, coaches are asking nothing but just giving orders.
In Norway, coach has much more time to personally deal with athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norway's recordings at 400 meters and 400 meters in a hurry.
Footwash brought the snowboarder Janne Korve to the horizons of the entire career - now in the World Championships: "Comfortable when I do not hate anything"
Now it has been nice to count when nothing happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, is one of the most successful snowboarders in Finland, and this season he really enjoyed his beloved species.
Last summer, the career extension was at stake.
The fatigue fatigue had been forced on the Korve cut-off table in January, and the foot did not want any healing.
I guess had taken a hit in the runway.
In the summer I did not know what to do, whether or not to board.
Sponsorships were broken and many things open, Korpi says.
But that's what it says is that things are about to be arranged.
The foot improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood again started pulling on the slope.
The decision then was easy.
I knew it at the latest when I went once on the snow.
I was wondering, yes this is so much fun, we're pulling a couple more.
Korpi managed to fall off properly in September-October, but after a long break, the only painful training was a big deal.
There are only a few riders in Korpi.
It does not hurt.
The races have never been the most important aspect of Jewelery ever.
I've never fallen for one race.
I think it's frustrating to be four years in the races, and then you're in the heat for a week.
I can not think so, Korpi says.
Today, Korpi is competing in the semifinals of the Spanish World Championships in Sierra Nevada.
Even if the individual races do not keep him boarding, he always comes up with a hard-to-run race.
According to Korvo, the prestige of the International Ski Federation has grown in recent years, although some of the riders selected Norwegian X-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important games, the visibility is big.
However, in my opinion, appreciation always depends on what kind of conditions and what level of competition there is.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in the 12-member Finnish team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's quarters, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are Korpea 14 years younger.
It's nice to keep up with younger guys.
I remember when it was just that everything was new and so sick I was excited about everything.
It also brings new power to it, Korpi thinks.
On the slope I still stay somehow behind, but otherwise I do not have enough power in my buddies!
Behind the boarding career Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sport career.
The Commander Pekka Korven's son is hooked on horse racing: the boarder has his own horseshoes for whom he is doing training programs.
When I'm on a trip all the time, so there's nothing more to be in the mess.
But every day I look at nutrition results and generally something out there, "says Korpi.
Corduroy and Raven Training are, according to Korve, a potential career plan when the boarding career is coming to an end.
I do not want to design so far, but it is at least a likely option.
I feel like it's a bit like studying it alongside this snowboarding.
I try to keep pace with time and develop, and maybe in the summer maybe even going out.
If it's my future profession, then it's not hard to start when it's already within the species.
Ravens are also included with the Elitloppet cruise cruise organized by the concierge Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship heading towards the Elitloppet race in Stockholm at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition again.
The cruise has gone very well, and people have been excited.
Now we are at the point that at least we will not go bankrupt.
A few months still have time, hoping to get the ship full, says Korpi excited.
Attendo's nursing project for Kite is all surprised
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new 41-year-old nursing home for Kitee.
The construction of more than 1,700 floor space meters will be completed next summer on the other side of the Health Center of the health center.
In general, the topic of wondering about crystallization is that where the new treatment unit is enough for customers, because now during the siam worms, many private nursing homes are in the hands of customers.
Anne Flink Attendo, Regional Director of Nursing Services, commented that Kite will have more demand in the future, not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, freedom of choice will also work better, Flink says.
Attendo purchased last year from Kite, private nursing homes Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The deal was about business, but there is a five-year lease agreement for real estate.
Flink says that Attendo has no acute need to move functions out of these premises.
More on this topic later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand in the Scottish mill
The trade union invites McVitie's cookie maker leaders to confirm their long-term commitment to production at Glasgow's factory.
According to the UK Department of General Trade, GMB's Scotland, the company has not disclosed its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
Hobnobs and Rich Tea cakes and other products manufacturing plants have more than 500 employees.
The Pladis company, owner of the McVitie's brand, said it had invested more than five million pounds in the mill in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives "will surely be the first to tell" if changes are being made.
In a letter to the plant manager, GMB urges the company to "respond to the concern that no financing has been made for the modernization of production lines".
GMB Trade Union Drew Duffy finds it very worrying that the factory manager will not get clear information about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and in the metropolitan area of Glasgow, which is a major employer in the area of high unemployment and low income.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihood, as well as Brexit's rising cost of living and continuous reduction of production, eastern Glasgow is in dire need of a successful McVitie's production. "
According to the spokesperson, the factory manager had received a trade union letter only on the previous day and the company will reply directly to the letter as it appreciates the ongoing interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with workers and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago when we discussed openly on a number of issues.
We talked with our employees, for example, that we, like other companies that are highly competitive and insecure, are constantly evaluating all of our business units and our offices in order to maintain our competitiveness. "
According to the spokeswoman, the company has invested more than 5 million pounds in the Tollcross mill in recent years, especially its production lines and operations.
"We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a production plant, and we are sure to be the first employee and trade union representative if we are going to make changes to the plant's operations."
Did PSG Barcelona warn about the transfer of Neymar three years ago?
LaLiga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up on Neymar's pursuit after paying a £ 189 million transfer agreement to terminate the deal but warns PSG Barcelona for a record transfer three years ago?
The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record of the transfer amounts, which was less than half the previous record: it was when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a £ 89m transfer.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive soccer player and also the world's best hired professional athlete, as PSG offers him over £ 500,000 weekly pay after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious with PSG's behavior and the way Neymar has left the club for a long time. A source close to Barcelona says the club has been very worried about Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did PSG chair the football world about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that he was interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG's best-looking clubs.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they want our players, we will become their opponents and contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they want our players, they have to face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of this: he expressed his interest in PSG midfielder Marco Compared earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italians to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona loses his star player Neymar.

NOW: Trump's Heaved Calls were Invented - White House Officer: "I would not say it was a lie"
The White House admits that two calls by US President Donald Trump never happened, says the New York Times magazine.
Trump's incantations with both the President of the Mexican President and the Scouts Association have proven invented.
White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no phone calls had taken place.
However, he said that Trump did not lie.
According to Sanders, many scout leaders have spoken to Trump personally, and Trump had been discussed with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
I would not say it was a lie, it's a pretty lousy charge.
Those conversations happened, they did not just happen on the phone but on the face, Sanders argued.
Speech for scouts provoked disapproval
Trump told Monday that the Mexican president had called him and praised Trump's successful illegal immigration eradication.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto reported that the sparse will no longer cross the southern boundary of Mexico because they know the trip is in any case jagged on the US border.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government issued a press release stating that no such call had taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico released a full version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In that, Trump echoed at a grand meeting of the national scout organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from a cop party leader, he said it was the coolest talk they've ever been to.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the scout organization announced that it was not aware of any of its leaders for a call to Trump.
According to the statement by former director Michael Surbaugh, who had asked Trump to pay tribute to the scouts, spoke of himself.
Trump's speech at the Scouts' Association summoned a lot of surprise, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he ignored the results of last autumn's presidential election.
