Camille Auer wanted to fix gender, diagnosed to be mentally ill and now he's doing the art on the topic - "People should have the right to their own body"
The academy of fine arts Project room -gallery hanging from the ceiling, dozens of patient reports.
Each of them read Camille auer's name.
On paper, the perennial story about how outside people have written up interpretation of Auer and of this identity.
Decided him who he is.
"I wanted to tell a personal my medical history, so that the process of violence should be visible", Auer says.
The process he refers to gender in the repair process.
It is often-year study period which included meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, and doctors.
The process starts by referral "gender identity disorder" in the diagnostic studies carried out in Tampere and in Helsinki.
Auer's process started four years ago.
Already before this he had used through the internet that he ordered, estrogen and was not very long in your repair process.
He felt he was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through the repair process, so that the sex can also be corrected legally.
Trans law, i.e. the law of transsexuals sex fixing (563/2002) oblige transgender people to get a vasectomy, so that the correct gender can be, for example, the population register centre and the passport.
At the moment each gender to repair from a required psychiatric diagnosis and testimony to reproductive inability.
To the people belongs the right to decide over their own bodies.
"This situation is intolerable and a violation of human rights," said Auer.
Trans law reform has been spoken in Finland for a long time.
The UN human rights council has adopted a law on the eight note and the European court of human rights's ruling, which obliges the European convention on human rights the parties to comply with self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared the law on the transformation of the then social affairs and health minister Susanne Huovinen chair.
Come the election and the true finns rose to the government.
Now the law change is once again stuck.
It's about the internal political disputes that don't even relate this to the relevant law.
"The government does not want to raise it on a table, because within the government's disagreement with the law", told Amnesty Finland department executive director Frank Johansson.
Exhibition space the front is dominated by two large installations.
One of them formed auer's used by the pharmaceutical packaging and instructions for use.
Patient report-installation of any visitor can read, for example, the Tampere university hospital transpolin psychological interpretation of Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer two times and wrote these on the basis of the report, which should define auer's right to care and assistance.
The studied reality show exposed horjumiselle.
The examinee perception of yourself show yourself to the limit order level in the way fragmented and personality related to the unstable features are emphasized.
Auer did not recognize themselves in these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed mentally ill," Auer said.
Even bigger shock was when auer for not granted gender-reassignment treatment.
Medical personnel according to her resources have not been sufficient for the process to start.
He was denied his own identity.
Then 11. February 2015 Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked transpolin in the waiting lobby of the tv apart.
Later that television was born a work of art called the Monument for the Excluded, which Auer reflect on their experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone born a woman determined people can enlarged breasts, but the breast removal needs diagnosis", Auer says.
Your body is not your own, if you feel like you're more than birth defined your gender the amount.
Auer's experience is unfortunately not the only of its kind.
Sex reassignment surgery is for many people hard more mental reasons than purely medical operations.
Its undergo to meet dozens of people who have to justify their own existence and right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who have support and assistance for those in need are denied treatment, citing the fact that their resources enough," Auer said.
Many in the process of applying senior is behind psychiatric symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
Those relying on the medical staff may prescribe that treatment can be started.
"Care and help to prevent can plunge people in worse situation than what it was before the process started," Auer said.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.
Exhibition publication in the text of the Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts my entire adult life time and that's the thing, what people are usually difficult to digest".
Depression is treated with medications and when Auer started the hormone of exercise, I feel better.
He was able to finally lyrics to sentiments that existed in childhood and teenage years.
Its why the width of the jaw didn't seem to fit into your body and why the pectoral muscles come to be a round flat chest instead.
The most important thing Auer has been that close to him is the people who saw him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"Themselves have to justify so much by talking, dressing, voice use and movements," she says.
Today, Auer experiencing already be seen, she exists as a woman.
Early in the process of close random comment could, however, hurt a lot.
The most hurt it, when you close the wrong gender.
"They should know and they know who I am, but not willing or able to internalize it," she continued.
All trans people, however, do not need physical changes.
They do not suffer from the body dysforian, i.e. the body contradictions, in which the body or its parts can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
Without hormone use and the long research process, however, cannot get official confirmation of my gender.
"In these studies, there is no medical justification", Auer said.
And it's true.
For example, in Denmark, parliament adopted in June 2014, a new procedure for legal gender recognition.
The new law is based on the sovereignty of the legal sex ratio.
Age the applicant makes a written application to the new person id on the report that he experiences himself to be the other sex.
Half-year period after the applicant confirms its application to writing and the ministry to give the applicant a new person id.
This self-determination is required also in Finland and this requirement crystallized also auer's exhibition.
It has not been artist of the therapy experience, but the exhibition's political and artistic works in the collection.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can be used to bring about political change, a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.

The civil rights organization issued a travel warning Missouri
African-american civil rights drive of the national NAACP organization has given Missouri the travel warning. The reason are the state's discriminatory practices and there happened to racist attacks.
”The NAACP's Missouri the travel advisory comes into force 28.8.2017, and it calls for african-american tourists, visitors and local, to pay particular attention and to observe extreme caution when traveling in the state, which has recently been a vast number of questionable race-based events”, the organization's bulletin states.
Missouri recently entered into force, the law complicates the discrimination cases export law. In addition, the laws of the state of implementation fall disproportionately on minorities. NAACP:no, these issues led to the travel warning.
”People's civil rights are violated.
They are stopped based on skin color and beaten or killed”, the NAACP's Missouri president Rod Chapel notes the Kansas City Star newspaper.
”We have not previously heard of as many cases as in a short time.”
Missouri the travel newsletter is the organization's first U.s. state warning.
Organisations mentioned as examples of african-american students made against the racist comments of Missouri at the university as well as Tennessee native was a 28-year-old black Tory sanders's death.
Sanders died in uncertain circumstances earlier this year. He was driving across state when his car ran out of fuel. Missouri police arrested him, although he is not accused of a crime.
Travel bulletin also referred to the Missouri attorney general's report, according to which the police stop a black driver 75 percent more likely than white.
”Travel bulletin purpose is to urge people to be vigilant and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what Missouri can happen,” Chapel said.
”People must be prepared, for example by including the money for the guarantee of payment for, or by telling the relatives that are planning to travel to the state.”
According to the FBI, Missouri was recorded in 2015 one hundred hate crime i.e. the sixth, the second most Us states.
A travel warning is also in response to Missouri's new law, which is difficult for the companies to challenge the rights of housing and employment in the evident discrimination.
The constitution guaranteed civil rights to the ACLU-the organization recently issued a travel warning to Texas and Arizona, after they had been approved by the immigration laws obliging the police to arrest people on immigration violations. According to the organization, this will increase racial profiling.
Usually travel warning release the ministry of foreign affairs, and they concern other states. Recently, however, the ngos have published their response to certain laws and trends in the united states.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair explanation of the ceo's supplementary pension
The state of the owner control of the responsible minister of economic affairs, Mika Lintilä (centre.) has asked the Finnair report to the airline's ceo Pekka Vauramo from getting the additional pension contributions, the Yle report.
It is according to the minister against the state's wishes.
Vauramo by 130 000 additional pension arose this week, when the Helsingin sanomat coverage of listed companies ' directors remuneration developments.
Finnish image magazine news Vauramo additional pension in February.
Finnair told to give up their additional pensions in 2013.
The state is, no further pensions being used to reward.
State-owned finnair for more than half.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year, the owner of the control principle with the decision.
Sanctions hard made immediately after the speeches
Yet some time ago it seemed that the Us and Russia relations are on the way from cold to warm.
Hamburg held the industrialised countries of the G20 in the context of met Us president Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin seemed to get along fine.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The us congress last week approved and Trump on Wednesday signed by the new economic sanctions in Russia, bitterly.
The most stunning response so far is to hear prime minister Dmitry Medvedeviltä, which, according to Trump signed the sanctions law means "a full-scale trade war".
Although the Russian reaction you set off just political rhetoric as kärjistykseen you and ylilyönteinä, is the United states, between russia and the tightening of the fact of the short Trump selection to the post after the honeymoon.
In the united states, Russia, Iran and North Korea on the sanctions of the law passing was not simple.
Congress did approve a law with considerable unanimity, but the president adoption of the law was the by far more difficult.
Trump criticized, freshly signed his law, the "significant shortcomings".
President Trump nyrpeytensä probably been the reason for Russia in particular, although also have their own powers to restrict its adoption of the law must have been disgusting.
As well it is known, are traded in the united states investigation as russia's possible involvement in the presidential elections as a Trump campaign in Russia-the links.
The united states and Russia tightening is the fact the short the honeymoon after.
When the White house staff has changed frequently and different scandalous twists is revealed almost update, to show still more clearly that a foreign policy made in the united states in the presidential chair, but the president despite.
Such a situation is not what we want to be.
If Russia-a relationship is tricky in the united states, the same applies also to the European union.
Economic sanctions in addition to the tense security situation on the union in the core area of the Baltic sea to tighten the relationships.
The EU has conspicuously kept out of the situation in Ukraine Russian relations and called for the Minsk agreement implementation.
Although the union has so far remained Russian policy, at least on the face of united, are member states of the interests are quite different.
The Finnish like Russian with a lot of trading for member states, economic sanctions have been a real pain in the ass.
The us fresh sanctions law effects are still unclear.
In the EU, it is feared that the sanctions will hamper many european company's operations.
In finland, the effects can be felt for example, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project as well as possibly the Fennovoima nuclear power.
The acidity in Europe is caused by the fact that sanctions have been excluded from, for example, the United states economy, the most important liquid natural gas lng.
Trade sanctions are a means in world politics the means of showing disapproval.
Economic sanctions, however, must be very thoughtful and precise-ranging.
Otherwise they have easily more harm than good.
Isn't anything sacred anymore?
Trump's White house is now in the crosshairs of the statue of Liberty
The statue of absence is the surest sign of change of power.
Americans know it as well as others: the iraqis fell along with the american soldiers with Saddam Hussein statue in Firdos square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration pääideologeista, knew very well what he was doing, after an intense debate, CNN's Jim There. The statue of liberty had miller's attack on the word harkassa, on the president's proposal to reduce legal immigration substantially.
Miller does not actually criticized himself statues.
If he had done so, he would get attacked by huge herds of cruise organizers and the statue of Liberty imitoivia characters.
His attack was the target of the statue's importance and especially the fact that in 1903 the pedestal of the statue was added to the Emma Lazarus poem – for 17 years the statue after graduation.
Thus, Miller berated Acosta: ”I don't want to go into it in more detail to the history, but the statue of Liberty is... the whole world illuminating the american symbol of freedom.
The poem was added later, not part of the original statue of Liberty.”
Miller was not in itself wrong, but it's not just about history, as he himself said.
Essential are the lazarus of touching words, the only of its kind, in which the state is not called only to immigrants but to ”the poorest of the poor”: ”Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.”
The poem is now more relevant than ever.
Miller is not engaged in literary criticism. He made it clear that ”the poorest of the poor” are not welcome Trump to the united states.
Controversy the statue of Liberty the meaning is part of a broader political and cultural controversy in the United states importance.
Lazarus friends continued to campaign after his death on its behalf, that the poem should be attached to the pedestal of the statue. They know very well that the act had been deeply political.
The statue was intended to embody the French and the american republic types of connections in a classical metaphor, of free feminine embodiment below.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gave itself a new name: the deportees mother.
The poem connecting the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on american nationality will get you that.
Lazarus moved to the statue's meaning, and the right-wing has long wanted to change it back to original.
Rush Limbaugh – the mouth of the caller, which can now be regarded as some kind of omen Trump – claimed in 2010 that the statue of Liberty is presented to anyone, but it is a neocon of the early pioneer, which will take Us up the torch of darkness to cover the world: ”Lady Liberty steps forward.
He takes the torch of freedom in the united states rest of the world.
The torch does not show the way to the united states.”
Rare yes, Limbaugh was partly right.
The statue of liberty the meaning depends entirely on perspective.
Lazarus saw it as poor and weary but hopeful immigrants on the ship's deck a long and afflicting after the trip.
He saw the protection and search of a better life people's point of view.
His statue of liberty their comfort by giving hope and by welcoming.
And Miller and Trump are not in any case want.
Their torches did not show the road but hate the flames, their only power source.
Athletics championships 2017: Neil Black praised the great Britain national team scottish members
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two scots from the British national team
British athletics league results director Neil Black said that the world cup participating team 16 scottish members have ”significant confirmation”.
On Friday in London began in the athletics world championships has been selected a record number of scottish athletes.
Black, according to Scotland ”there is happening something special”, in which the British athletics must learn.
”This is welcome, and we will continue to study it for so long that we understand what is at issue,” Black said.
”The discussion of the Scottish sports institute with the representatives, and they thought that it is related to the activities of the institute.
The scottish athletics association again believes that it is related to union activity,
and the British athletics federation believes that its background is of their actions.
And the ordinary guy off the street thinks that he must have something to do with it.
However, this is something awesome, wherever it is.”
Many of the scottish athletes competing in London serious medals, among others, Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes for Sir Mo Farah with the 5 000-meter race. Eilidh Doyle, in turn, was elected team captain.
”Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was amazing”, Black said.
”Athletes remove their opportunity to proud of their achievements and strongly motivated regardless of where you happen to live and practice.
Eilidh's words was genuine emotion and passion for the sport.”
Eilidh Doyle is a Commonwealth championships silver medalist in the 400 meter hurdles, and these are his fifth world championship. In his opinion, is ”incredible” that the national team has 16 scots.
The previous record was seven in 1983 and 2015.
The average distance of the runner Laura Muir has run during the year, five British and two European records.
He will compete in london in the 1 500 metres and 5 000 metres.
Chris O'hare ran in London from 1 to 500 meters. Also her you should keep an eye on: the man has behind him an excellent season, which includes winning the Uk qualifiers and Anniversary Games -competitions.
Doyle remembers the first world cup competition, making the team the only scot besides him was Lee McConnell.
The national team captain said he was ”immensely proud” of the fact that there are so many scots, some of which will compete in serious finals places and medals.
”Captain access is already a great honor, but even more special it is, therefore, that the national team members voted captain,” Doyle said.
”I am of course very proud of all the scots, who reached the national team.
It shows how far we've come.
They are involved in distinguished as athletes, who compete for the podium.
The captain's speech?
I think it went pretty well.
I focused on how lucky we are, when we have home games.
It is important to enjoy the home crowd support and the fact that we are again in the olympic stadium.
I get another chance to compete there, and I know that the atmosphere will be amazing.”
Critics of blocking facebook in: don't run for public office, if you can't take criticism
The father of our country know what is bad publicity.
Americans love George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for all possible domestic policy always to his political principles.
The criticism certainly was annoying,
but he is not silenced arvostelijoitaan.
”If free speech is removed, we may be lead to the empty and silent like sheep to the slaughter,” Washington said in 1783.
That brings us to the Maryland governor Larry Hoganiin, which should take a lesson from Washington.
Hogan's staff has deleted his official Facebook page, at least 450 comments and blocked their authors.
The american civil liberties union challenged Hogan to court earlier this week.
His staff to keep the challenge as unfounded, and the attitude was dismissive also online.
”What's the difference? This is only Facebook”, many commented.
But this is important
especially in hogan's case.
Hogan is the democrats dominated the state's amazingly popular republican governor.
He has received briefings secondly, the best estimates of the 50 governor.
Hogan is not responsive hothead.
He has led the state firmly and kept strictly adhering to the principles.
He has also used the Facebook as the main communication channel of their voters are set up and released there, the image of chemo, bald of head.
Therefore, the governor's Facebook page, future users of the obstruction is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor's page is public and official forum, that his staff maintain tax funds.
Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's action the Washington Post in an interview. According to him, it was about the only comments moderated.
Commenters stamping trolls, spämmääjille or a hater is, however, too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed Hogan facebook in inhibitors users.
They turned out to be regular people, who wanted to discuss their choice with the leaders. They weren't trolls but, for example, teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors.
They told me that their comments were respectful, attentive and businesslike.
The pastor quoted the comment in the bible; he wanted to appeal Hogan of the catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland, Bowie wasn't hostile, but raised the question of hate crimes.
”I commented politely that I was disappointed that Hogan had taken a position on hate crimes and other recent news,” he wrote in the Washington Post the news in comments.
”I also cannot accept the fact that when more people comment the same thing, they are held right in some way organised as a set and ignore a large group of concerned citizens.”
The governor's staff called the comments ”focused attack”. Someone else could call them important to keep certain things to promote.
Facebook's era of communication is easy to control by preventing the reviewer or by removing critical comments.
In the old days would have been to send staff to collect and burn the newspapers that had published critical editorials, or to arrest and silence the protesters.
Is really about, however, the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public officer who has been accused Facebook and other social media channels chained.
President Trump will prevent Twitter users are suing him.
The subject was given the first significant decision last week in Virginia.
Alexandria district court judge James C. cacher proculis, according to the Loudoun county government violated the constitution of the United states for the first increment block in the voter's Facebook.
And United states civil rights union went to discuss kentucky's republican governor Matt Bevinin with Twitter and facebook I use.
This should not be difficult.
Washington time affordable postage had a similar effect as nowadays the internet.
Number of newspapers quadrupled from the year 1776 to the year 1800, and the nameless authors out of Washington.
Already at that time there were trolls.
The name of the character Jurico, Valerius, Belisarius and the porti on of wrote the newspaper letters, which they called washington's decisions.
The president's office was flooded with petitions, which were criticized Jay's treaty, the United states and British cooperation, trade and shipping agreement. This is evident from the Papers of George Washington web process collection of the documents.
He does not, however, silenced arvostelijoitaan.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are our nation's foundation stone.
Real leadership means to this fact acceptance.
Birds summer feeding should be terminated immediately

Poverty and the death of indonesia's gold country
Bardina dege was no use in cooking stoves.
Cat, bam, he uses only rarely.
Dege lived in the wooden building Enarotalissa, Pan area in the capital, located in indonesia's troubled Papua province. When he prepared dinner, he usually put a sweet potato – locally ”nota” – directly on the hearth.
After half an hour of cinder burnt sweet potato is eaten greedily with his bare, unwashed hands.

Degea is young husband of four wives, and is not prescribed fields to be treated.
Polygamy is common around here.
Late work can be dangerous: most of the village men are unemployed, and many drink a lot. In addition, must take into account the soldiers.
”No one dares walk in the village after five in the evening”, - he told.
This is a rare glimpse into the everyday life of the Papuan highlands, in the former Dutch colony, which was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. Annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum, in which 1 026 village elders were forced to vote publicly to the occupation forces in front.
The Dutch authority has objected to the local independence movement quickly turned his anger to the Jakarta government, which will keep the region firmly under his control and prevented foreign journalists and human rights observers access there.
In 2003, the province was divided into the official in Papua and West Papua. The island's eastern part belongs to Papua-New Guinea.
Enarotali is a remote and dreary. The journey there begins a half hour flight to the provincial capital of jayapura from Nabire and constant stomach turning a five-hour drive by rental car.

Papua is Indonesia's poorest province. Its population, 28% live below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are the highest in Asia.
But it is also indonesia's el dorado.
Pan is about the New Jersey-sized upland area with 153 000 inhabitants. Only about a hundred kilometers from Pan, is Grasberg, the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine. It is owned by the Freeport McMoran company, whose registered office is Phoenix in the united states.

In addition, Papua is estimated at 78 billion dollars of timber resources functions.
Papualaisista these riches however, the misery, because they mean indonesia's strong military repressive presence.
The New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid the local military personnel and army local units nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004. Individual officers were paid up to $ 150,000.
Papuan demands greater self-determination threaten this source of income, and they will be silenced without mercy.

”The number of victims of the calculation is difficult, because cases weekly,” said Andreas Harsono, Human Rights Watch's Indonesia researcher.
The screw is tightened, when the Papuan natural resources attract migrants from elsewhere in Indonesia.

Indonesian president joko Widodo – nicknamed Jokowi – promised 2014 election campaign to intervene in the Papuan injustices and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 area, and this former carpenter won the vote 27 in the region, including the Pan, the trip to Jakarta's presidential palace.
But little has changed in Papua and the locals feel they have been deceived.

About a thousand papualaista – young men and women and children – gathered in the football field for the local police station and the army command center in front of the calls for justice.
They had with them a party to the expenditure referred to hunting bows, and they began to ask Papua Mee Pago tribe traditional with wai-dance, where they dance in a circle and imitate bird songs.
Part of the protesters began throwing rocks at police and army buildings.
When the atmosphere heats, the soldiers received in the internal radio system of a commandment: ”If the human troops made their resistance more than three times, shoot them to death.” Data set up TIME magazine to see the official document, which has not been disclosed to the local media.
Yeremias Kayama, 56, Kegon Koto area, resident manager, suspect control and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
”When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist,” he told TIME magazine the bright color of your painted puutalonsa on the porch.
Kayama still does not know who shot him, but the bullets became a soldier of the ranks.
”Crowded place, was shot several shots.”
Alfi the Youwin was shot three times. His cousin saw the shootings.
”I ran up to him and make sure that it was indeed he” says Yohanes TIME magazine for sad. Many indonesians he used only one name.
”I saw that he was dead... I Kissed him.”
Papua police chief inspector Yot, Mende told journalists that the police only ”protect” the police station, because it was the target of the attack.
”We have to defend, when people threaten to kill us,” Papuan police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said the year 2015.
”Then it is a matter of life and death.”
Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many injured.
Information on the killing coming to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi should jayapura in an emotional speech, where he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and promised that the Papuan violence are addressed.
”I want to, that the case will be investigated immediately, so that never again will similar things happen.”
Security minister Wiranto said in October 2016, that he launched the human rights violations statements outside of the judicial system.
He began withdrawing immediately after the speeches.
”Most of the offences happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but it is needed for certain processes,” he said.
TIME magazine in an interview in Jakarta 5.6.2017 Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he didn't intend to start studies in Papua.
”All is settled in court,” he says.
The UN blamed wiranto for ”crimes against humanity”. Crimes related to more than a thousand people died to East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999. Wiranto said the TIME-the press, that Papuan human rights violations has already cleared 11 cases, including the Pan events.
Pan of the victims ' families respond to the allegations gloomy incredulity.
”I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way,” Yohanes told.
”I'm already tired of this.”
He told me his life still in fear, even though the event is already in.
“Yes, I'm afraid,” he said.
“I'm afraid that the army will arrest me. I'm afraid I will be shot.”
His brother Yacob confirms that paniailaiset do not dare to discuss the incident.
He told me that the soldiers had beaten him, when he had helped to bury the four victims.
”The soldiers are looking for me the hands in the victims ' burials after,” he said.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday Indonesian police shoot villagers pan into the neighbourhood Deiyaissa.
One dead and 17 injured villagers and the construction company director in a conflict between, which originated when the director refused to take sense of having lost their men to the hospital. The injured among them were also children.
Hospital treatment didn't need a man was a 24-year-old ravian of Douwe, who had been in the water when he was fishing on a nearby river. He died on the way to the hospital.
Vihastuneet the villagers were protesting the construction site of the company in front of the office.
According to police, the villagers threw rocks at police, who responded to a warning shot.
Local according to the Indonesian paramilitary police mobile police unit, however, opened fire on the crowd, when one of the villagers was killed.
”We are horrified. Afraid of revenge,” said the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw when the wounded were brought for treatment.
”I've been hiding at home for two days.”
Deiyain parliament has been calling the shots to shoot police officers accountable and the traffic police unit pulling out of the area.
Pan has always been the Indonesian government's problem.
The real lack of development is fueling discontent Mee-, Multi-, Dani and Damal tribe, who live in Papua did those in the central highlands.
Many have joined the Papuan liberation movement (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend papualaisten rights with random attacks and the Indonesian army soldiers in the abduction.
Part of the OPM's leaders have Pan, such as tadi the Yogi and Daniel yuda of Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arresting and imprisoning arbitrarily, thousands of people pan in ”national sovereignty, security” in the name.
Some of the detainees did not return back ever.
Papualaisten among pan was known as the ”sad, forgotten place”.
Poverty breeds discontent.
Enarotalissa is for sale for only a little rice, and even that is too expensive for the locals,
like the bread, too.
People grow food on their own: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is women's work, and one woman's responsibility may be four or five of sweet potato fields.
A large part of the harvest is family, and the rest sold at the market.
Dozens of sweet potatoes you only pay 10 000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the differences between local and migrants ' income to have grown, and changed number of subscribers has increased after the Nabire airport opened new routes.
Jobs are few, and they usually go local, better educated and wealthiest migrants.
Only a few of the papuan have sufficient capital and knowledge to run your business competitively.
”Young people do not want to stay in the village, because there are no jobs and no money,” said pan's tribal council chairman John Gobain.
Remote Papua remains the world low.
In addition, international reporting restrictions are still tight.
Earlier this year, French reporters Franck Escude and Bacillus Longchamp expelled Papualta, even if they had been granted rare permission. The official reason was the inability of the co-operation of local institutions.
Human Rights Watch Asia deputy director Phelim Kinen according to Jokowi has not kept his electoral promises. He did not add to the transparency and furthered the development by removing coverage restrictions.
”Indonesia's restless itäisimmissä province of Papuasta and Western Papuasta news vista suppliers is a new risk: the visa refusal and blacklisted,” Farman said in a statement.
The press freedom of action in the absence of means that the Indonesian government put pressure on the only Papuan in the near neighbors.
In march, the six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, marshall islands and solomon islands – are urging the UN human rights council to investigate Papua ”numerous and widespread violations”, including the pan at the shooting scene.
These states have traditionally also been supported by the Papuan liberation movement.
Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir refuted the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that ”Indonesia is still a democracy, where is freedom of the press, so the human rights violations evidence of the cover-up would be inconvenient”.
The locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When the human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar, led by the Dutch official delegation on a visit to jayapura in 4.5.2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, told the meeting participated in the anonymous source.
Indonesia has presidential elections in 2019, but the papuans say that they no longer likely to vote for Jokowi.
”Jokowi means well, but he's surrounded by people who are involved in pan at the shooting scene,” said tribal council chairman Gobain.
He wants to Jokowin know paniailaisten situation: they live a greedy and unpredictable army under the power of lack and poverty, virtually devoid of health services and educational opportunities.
Gobain, according to paniailaiset, like other papuans, keep jokowin to give his vote to a ”debt” that has to be paid back.
”They don't want money. They just want justice,” he said.
Threats and intimidation, despite pan's shooting attack victims showed once again the resistance metaphorically: they buried one of the victims of the police station and the army supply points across the country.
They knew they may never get justice, but at least they do not give responsible to forget their crimes.
”Members of my family were killed”, Yacob said with my head down.
”What else can we do?”

In the united states more than 20 percent of the air passengers bring prohibited objects, reveals survey
Airline passengers to do the survey reveals that more than 20% of the passengers in the united states had exported the prohibited items knowingly or unknowingly planes over United states transport security agency (TSA) checkpoints. At least six per cent of the passengers had a knife or other blade-equipped objects, which they knew was prohibited.
Less than one percent reported having only afterwards to know that they were mistakenly transported weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The questionnaire was answered by more than a thousand passengers, and it was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters -charter flight company. The results also reveal that young passengers flout the rules more likely.
TSA rules are deliberately non-compliant passengers to 19.7% Y-generation representatives, and less than 15% of the X-generation.
More generally, rules were broken by taking an airplane food and liquids.
More than three % of the exports of the blade-equipped objects consciously on the plane. In addition, 2.2% of women and 3.7% of the men told me he took banned drugs knowingly on a plane.
The survey was attended by passengers from across the united states. The survey carried out, the company wanted to find out how many had been smuggling goods accidentally past the security check and how many had done so deliberately.
It is not surprising that most of the passengers take also the smuggling of goods more likely to be past the security check – knowingly or unknowingly.
But, as the survey made the company notes, TSAn instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids on a plane can take and how much.
It is therefore not surprising that the majority of TSA seizures is fluids.
For a time it was prevalent also the belief that the plane is not allowed to take books.
Liquids can take domestic flights but not international flights.
The united states environmental protection agency director Scott Pruitt reverse its decision to delay obama's season decisions to reduce emissions
The day after, when 15 states had sued the U.s. environmental protection agency EPA director Scott Pruitt court, Pruitt cancel its earlier decision to delay the Obama administration on smog-causing emissions-reduction decisions.
Pruitt, according to the change indicates that his agency took the previous administration, and a better account of the state responsible for the environment of the decision-makers needs.
Pruitt did not mention the word action, that his earlier decision had been brought against the federal court of appeal.
The state should begin to comply with ground-level ozone in the year 2015, the requirements of 1.10. from.
Pruitt announced in June that his transfer decisions in the years ahead, so his agency will have more time to become familiar with the plan, because the agency ”does not want to interfere in local decision-making or hinder economic growth”.
Pruitt was the state of Oklahoma attorney general, before president Donald Trump appointed him to the EPA director. Pruitt is known for stricter environmental regulations as an opponent.
Washington since Pruitt has repeatedly tried to stop or delay the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industries against by the decisions of the executive.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback for the Pruitt plan to mitigate the provisions.
Last month in Washington located a federal appeals court issued a decision, which, according to the head of the EPA overstepped its bounds in trying to delay oil and gas companies in the candles on the obama administration's decision to the executive. The decision ordered the company to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
On Wednesday evening issued a statement in Pruitt claimed that his u-turn its ozone regulations only strengthen the EPA cooperation states with the complex process, the aim of which is the new requirements in accordance with the schedule.
”Previous administrations during the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines and waited, then, that activist groups and others to challenge it in court, with the agreement on schedule,” Pruitt said. He sued in the previous action the environment agency to court more than ten times.
”We do not believe in litigation through regulatory and we take deadlines seriously.
We take seriously our activities regulation and its us associated powers.”
The EPA's opinion, however, found that Pruitt can continue to use ”their powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers” to ensure that the provisions ”are justified and based on the best available information”.
The republicans run the congress of the ozone provisions of wider change.
Last month approved a law the aim of this initiative is to delay the 2015 decision of the executive at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the senate.
The EPA this week sue which the state associations led to the New York state attorney general Eric Schneiderman reported that the group intends to continue the pressure.
”EPA's change of mind application of our result is a major victory for those 6.7 million for newyorkilaiselle and more than 115 million americans who are exposed to their communities smog of the direct impacts”, Schneiderman said.
New York in addition to the application were involved California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground level ozone is formed by, for example, when cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants emissions react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
This smog can cause serious breathing problems sensitized human group. It is also a contributing factor to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promote and environmentalists rejoiced Pruitt surprising change of direction.
”It is worrying how much pressure was required to breathe the air of our equivalent of the guy used common sense,” said Lori Ann Burd biodiversity centre.
”We must continue to fight Trump's regime as its ideological goal is to serve polluters and other vested interest groups on the terms.”

Finland preparing for a licensed scream-making
Still the soup was not even considered legalization.
The underlying argument that the process of producing liquor the addition of methanol, which is toxic.
The screaming, preparation at home is legal next year, but still soup the legalization of the not even consider.
Scream made from fermented, moonshine again by distillation.
Distillation of the regulatory background is the argument that the process of producing liquor the addition of methanol, which is toxic.
I haven't seen the political will to shine in the soup provided for every man justice, justices Ismo Tuominen of social affairs and health department comments.
When the ministry prepared the law on alcohol reform, a moonshine distillation is not considered legalized.
The point was not made either to the political table.
Distillation of the release of no debate, mp Outi Mäkelä (ecr) notes.
He is the government party of the parliamentary factions negotiating in the gang, who take a position on alcohol law reform.
Permission to moonshine home distilling can not be in the future either admit even application.
Also, commercial manufacturers remain subject to licensing.
That to me suggests that the alcoholic beverage of home manufacture comes with a simple rule: the alcohol be made at home fermented.
This means that now the beer, cider and wine in addition to home can do legally kiljuakin.
The government wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law removes the requirements on flavourings and allows the scream of manufacture, Mäkelä focus.
Manufacturing must still take place so that the raw materials or their use in the context of the born flavor and aroma ingredients are to drink clearly noticeable.
The new law, according to the drinks to get prepared himself as much as he wants, and the self-made alcohol can give as a gift.
Sale it should not be still put.
The screaming, the act is not anymore in Finland, public health problem, that of believes.

The alcohol bill is now the ministry of justice under review.
The alcohol act comes to parliament for processing as soon as the fall season begins.
The plenary is 5.9.
The law comes into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well-prepared.
It is as parliament had already taken a position, Mäkelä rejoices.

The Georgian massacre: Activists staged again racist lynching ' justice
Ford's Mercury brand of car to bypass the crowd to Monroe, a small town in the Georgia countryside and continue their journey towards the small Moore’s Ford bridge.
The car has four black passengers and a white driver. Four armed men blocked the road, before the car gets to the bridge.
The leader of the group, she wears a stripy suit-dressed middle-aged man took a deep breath of sikaristaan and leering through the windscreen.
The passengers are scared.
”Roger, no---u!” the man äyskäisee.
”Get out of the car!”
Screams break the silence, when a young black man pulled out etuistuimelta.
This shocking event is, fortunately, only the re-enactment, which was presented to the 22.7.2017.
The shock of the groans, however, are the authentic, when a noose is threaded into ”Roger's” neck.
Human rights organizations have since 2005, returned to the Moore’s Ford bridge being set up again in 1946 events. At that time, the Ku Klux Klan lynched by two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been prosecuted for the murder.
”It is puzzling that no arrests have been made during these years – even if the murderers live among us, and many need to know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who help re-staging of the arrangements.
”It is the history of shame, but above all, it is a burden that weighs our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia congressman.
Her re-staging is a startling call to action. It also reminds of the Monroe residents to the fact that injustice has never been corrected.
”We want, that the guilty will be brought to justice. We want, that things will be finally completed, and we want to recover from grief and make peace, but above all, we want justice,” Brooks said.
”We can recover and make peace, before we get justice.”
The coroner covered the Georgian massacre in the dead victim's body 27.7.1946.
NBC news received by the FBI, according to the documents this lynching was suspected of more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties.
However, no one is accused of murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists, lynching ' motives have been all the time local knowledge: politics and sex.
In 1946 the state of Georgia a black man received the supreme court decision to vote for the first time in the presidential election. The supreme court issued its decision in April, and elections held in the summer.
According to the FBI, election time was an incident where a black tenant farmer, Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner Barnett Hesteriä in a fight, which, apparently, on Malcolm's wife Dorothy.
Brooks, according to the city it was rumored that Hesterillä had been in a relationship Dorothyyn and that Dorothy was waiting for this children.
FBI data according to the influential white landowner, Loy Harrison paid 25.7.1946 Malcolm's $ 600 bail, against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcolm and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousin, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before the Moore’s Ford bridge.
”It turns out that Harrison ordered and organized the murder,” the FBI report stated.
”It is also apparent that state and local authorities was a conspiracy. Authorities were complicit in the murders and destroy evidence do not reveal the witness's identity.”
Brooks expresses it more succinctly.
”It was the voice of justice,” he said.
”They were murdered because the black was to signal that they will do the same, if they are going to vote.”
Cassandra Greene has directed the Georgia massacre, the re-enactment of for almost a decade.
The show is extremely realistic and captivating. It is a description of the appalling racism of which many would like to believe is already lost in today's united states.
Show is hard to watch but even harder not to look at what Greene says is the point.
”We don't want to talk about this lynching, because we would have to face their own dark sides”, the director said.
”But I can't create a relationship with you, if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through.”
This year's draft workouts began in June. The first day of about 30 actors – a dozen black and two dozen white – gathered to listen to Greene's habituation who summary of the show.
Wade Marbaugh works Greene assistant director.
He has presented a re-staging of the local Ku Klux Klan leader for many years, but the role is always as difficult and repulsive.
”Makes me feel really dirty, because I'm not myself”, Marbaugh tell.
”It is important, however, that the history of this half is considered to be present, so that it will never happen again.”
The room on the other side of lines to rehearse Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, i.e. Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester.
The show starts with a scene where Malcolm yelling, and pushing Hesteriä. He is furious that the Hesterillä has been in a relationship Dorothyyn.
”Didn't you hear? I said get off my land, no---u!”
Rascon, i.e. Hester answer.
Then leaves the beats.
And then all (at least all the black actors) burst out laughing.
Greene laughed harder.
”What?!” Rascon to ask.
He is confused.
”Did I hit accidentally too hard?” he asks.
”You,” Greene chuckles.
”I just don't believe that white used at that time, the word n---u.”
”Thus”, the second black actor to confirm.
”It's slang. You need to use the longer version.”
The presentation topic is uncomfortable, but the room the power of the guy spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, and not just for show. They want to honor those who were killed memory.
The scene starts from the beginning.
Now Rascon word you cut.
No one is laughing.
The re-enactment ends quickly and violently.
Shouts, shots and the silence.
Black hautajaisasu the dressed woman standing next to the bodies and singing Billie Holiday Strange Fruit song.
His voice breaks every other word.
A few tens of metres to about fifty spectators wipe my eyes of sweat and tears.
The audience almost exactly half black and half white.
Among them is the couple who has come to see the show Ithacasta the state of New York, but for the most part is local.
They have been Brooks with the guidance of the victims on the graves of the Georgian edition of the way of humidity.
The murders have changed the story to be true. The atmosphere at the venue is heavy.
The song after the show, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the body.
Children kyykistyvät to look at fake blood and motionless bodies, and whispering to each other.
”They're not really dead”, the little boy murmured, like to remind themselves.
A few minutes after Greene to thank the audience.
Mobs raised actor takes off their cloak and wiped the tears.
Bradshaw hug Marbaughia, the local Ku Klux Klan leader, which made the man.
Nick rascon to hug the two actors and break out then tears hard after the show.
”Don't worry”, the show involved a woman to comfort.
”We know that you're not him.
I did this for a good reason.”
Later, the audience and actors gather for a joint dinner.
Altantin of white couples will discuss lively the show just to meet a black couple with.
Denise duplin unknown it is difficult to find words when he describes the presentation of the evoked sensations.
”It's hard to listen to the horrible words and watch the terrible things that say and do the people who look the same as you – just because they look the same as you,” he said.
”To me the show got to see that lynchings continue to occur,” he added. ”They just called you like alone.”
The room on the other side of Brooks recalls the civil rights development in the same table for seated listeners.
He's already told me that it had started next year's show design.
”The re-enactment is a powerful experience, because it describes the experience we horror, but it is also an educational experience,” Brooks said.
”The message is that this can happen again if we don't take lessons from us.
Those who do not know history are condemned to repeat it.”

There is a high risk situation, where the test soon-to-be 18 year. That's when the risk is around 10%.”

Fair play financial rules drawn up by Uefa president in 2007, elected the frenchman Michel Platinin initiative.
A former football player Platini was of the opinion that the success of the quest by going into debt was cheating and lead to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew support.
In 2011, the fair economic rules, the focus shifted to the clubs debt from the loss of monitoring.
The change meant that the Roman Abramovitšin for the first time in Chelsea in 2003, by the business model implementation is made difficult significantly. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player purchases and created a global brand.
Fair play to the economic rules of the current three-year assessment cycle lasts until 2018. During the monitoring you can do up to 30 million euro loss.
Even if Platini had to leave the Uefa president made the scandalous in 2015, also his successor Aleksander Ceferino wants to curb clubs ' reckless spending.
”Fair rules of the game are still in use, and apply them also in the future”, the fair play financial rules UEFAssa responsible Andrea Traverso told the Associated Press news agency last week.
Even if PSG pay Neymarin out of his contract lump sum, it may accrue the sum of the accounting in his new contract throughout duration.
Neymar has made a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded 44.4 million annual expense for the next five years.
Fair game's economy based on the rules distributed to the first sanctions in 2014. Major sanctions were handed down to PSG and Abu Dhabi financial claim Manchester City.
PSG had a 60 million euro fine, which was reduced later to 20 million. In addition, the club was ordered to restrict the Champions league team of 21 players for the season 2014-2015 the normal 25-player instead.
UEFA monitors clubs, who may try to evade the economic regulations by increasing the income the club owner the related companies of the season.
For example, if the qatari company will support the PSG, but the value of the aid is considered to be the normal market level, UEFA is not calculated to support the actual income.
This is what happened when UEFA decided in 2014 that the Qatar tourism authority to support PSG for oversized.
Has also become apparent that part of the Neymarin the merits of the PSG, may be used to finance qatar's 2022 football world cup organizing committee at the available payments.
PSG and the organizing committee have, however, denied that Neymarista were doing, the world cup ambassadors. Uefa would be very easy to reveal such an arrangement.
PSG's previous sanctions due to UEFA follow more accurately the companies go around the rules.
The situation informed sources told on Thursday that UEFA has not negotiated PSG's with Neymarin transfer.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on the condition that their identity not be revealed, because they do not have powers to discuss PSG's situation.
The latest announced financial statements according to PSG's turnover for the period 2015-2016 was 542,4 million and ebit of more than eur 10 million.
Last season's accounts have not yet been made public.
PSG expect Neymarin arrival to attract new sponsors and to increase monitoring of products and the game shirts for sale.
Monitor estimates that its turnover will grow by at least 30% Neymarin treaty.
The world's best player leaving a clearly irritated the Spanish league trying to Neymarin transfer. It was claimed to violate the fair play financial rules.
”This is a clear financial doping case, and that the states”, the Spanish league president Javier Tebas says the Spanish AS newspaper. The state he was referring to PSG's qatarilaiseen ownership.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger I also have reservations about the fact that the state financing of the football club operations. Arsenal owned by the american sports tycoon.
”The incident is a result of the ownership, which has changed the football environment completely over the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
”Everything is possible, after the state-owned football team.
Fair play to the economic compliance becomes very difficult. There is such a wide range of interests, related to the fact that the most famous player to represent the state.”

MM medal for finland in london to demand miracles
Athletics world championships begin in London today, Friday and lasted a little over a week ending with Sunday 13. August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are those species, which the finns bench athletes can take passion from one year to another, whether success or not.
Bench athletes ' hearts success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other metrics.
Less attention remain young athletes beautiful story of growth, you value games, where the experience, acquiring matured the athlete's performance to the level that the adult world championships medal is truly possible.
Now the Finnish small in the MM-team is not the kind of young athletes, and though old-timers either.
MM medal for Finland require a miracle.
Fortunately, the sports interest and the element of surprise is the fact that miracles can happen.
It pulls the bench athletes on tv in front of the screen and glue to follow the races, although the London medals for because of the time difference until the late evening.
In athletics the previous world championships 2015, Finland received one bronze medal.
The other javelin thrower Tero pitkamaki.
Uskalikot waiting for the long hill of medals now, while another told him and other throwers of recent results and the long hill of the qualifying round last summer's major competitions.
Went to these games in any way, long hill remains in history as the greatest Finnish sports hero.
The games of other Finnish sport for which access to the end of the competition or your own record is good enough performance.
I hope and believe the Finnish athletics in the coming years a realistic medal hunt gives a good success of the young international major competitions this summer, too.
The young talent in the processing and its work, financial support is more important than maintaining a small representation of the athletes in the elite troops.
Success does not come overnight but takes years of sweaty work athletes and patience as a coach as a spectator sport.
The finns know how to appreciate also the international sports stars and enjoy their unique performance.
I hope the London games will go down in history Usain Bolt and Mo Farah race, and not, for example, the fear of terrorism or cowardly attacks.

A small circle of nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer, and Comrade Detective
The story of hankering at the same time, as well as the character of the ' 80s glory days, and 90's grunge (at the time David Wain and Michael Showalter are doing great in The State-sketch a series of MTV) that their own time – in 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and a series of other stars moved up the career ladder to bigger and better things.
Cultural product that is both a parody of the description of the constant recollection that we have Facebook-in the era of jammed.
A commercial product, it seems a long time ago in the live from.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not only absurd humor (among other things, it was told to H. Jon Benjamin's voice, talking vegetable cans, the background story).
The joke at the core is that the middle-aged actors play age of approaching horny teenagers. Its emphasis on doing the past objective of the impossibility part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where the adults act like adults, there is less feeling-based, and its parody is more diffuse: it parodies, for example, be 90's stalker movie, like a horror movie the Hand that rocks the cradle.
One point, one of the characters to dig out the Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates, and ”other stuff since 1991”.
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is a writer now but still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And in some crazy plot with Ronald Reagan (as Michael Showalter) as an accomplice of George H. W. Bush (portrayed by the aptly-Michael Ian Black).
As always in this series, the best are on the path.
Especially fun is to see and eternally young Paul Rudd, which has a lower lip below the beard tassel, namely Matt Dillon ”soul patch” from the movie Singles. The rudd show by Andy, the camp of the king, began to be already an old man.
Random madness of the moment, you may raise this series to take off as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series, until it gets obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. Its in the last scene, a group of friends went to the Wet Hot American Summer movie premiere.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series again appeal to another kind of nostalgia: The Americans -a series of cold war spirit, the Atomic Blonde -the films and even GLOW-a series of wrestling catalog, where east meets west.
Comedy series created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made of the roma underground of the 1980s police drama, in which the bucharest kyttäpari fights for truth, an atheist and start a marxist regime-leninism.
Starring hard-faced to Gregor and idealistic iosefin to see Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulicin. Their lines are dubbed by English Channing Tatum (series executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-levitt.
It is a great idea,
but much more so it's not.
The series has some good visual jokes (the police spend their time by watching tv chess in the same way as americans are watching football).
Included is a set of famous voice actresses, including Jenny Slate, Nick Ganja, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny. They spot her to get all the fun of the game.
Comrade Detective, however, remains too caught up with a clumsy socialist drama to replicate the – with is, for example, Reagan-the mask behind the killer. Therefore, the series began often really feel clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and a series of humor not fast enough nor plentiful.
Summarize the series might work better agitprop-satire, like when Gregor and Iosef go repeatedly to the Us embassy and the lobby is always two fat man devouring a hamburger.
Message kuvitellulle communist to the public is that western culture can make all consumption and fast food.
A series of fictional Romanian creators weren't wrong: we eat numb their own in the middle of our history and their history.
Kouvola-Toni Tauru will rise Saturday into the ring in Macau - up against former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match upright.
Toni Tauru get in Macau against hard bone, for brazilian Leandro Issa took my last year in the UFC organization.
Brazilian is also a jiu-jitsu black belt, and the species of the world championship.
For once take myself older.
It is a funny thing, the 32-year-old Tauru tell.
Kouvola had to climb in the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was canceled because of logistical problems, but the three struggled to get was the quick schedule of the Chinese autonomous territory of Macau.
Tauru has not previously encountered such.
This was the first time, when the fight was canceled.
It was annoying, because preparing and workout took a lot of time.
Fighter is pleased, however, that the struggle of the new period.
Weeks of waiting has little impact to prepare.
The transfer does not affect the shape, because it is not a week to improve.
The condition can go more worse, now if I practice too much.
Tauru is a matter of the previous struggle faced opponents whose strengths are able ottelemisessa.
This time the situation is different.
Issaa from kouvola-describes typical brazilian.
He is quite an aggressive fighter.
My guess is that he will become the first installment in the hard top and try to take the carpet.
He has won the jiu-jitsu world championship, so he knows how to wrestle.
Kouvola of the previous match didn't go according to plan.
Filipino Kevin Belingo hit Taurua, eye corner, and victory remained to the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially upright: he didn't get any hits.
When I go to crash, he hit his eye on me.
It annoyed for a really long time.
New motivation
Part of the free take up that fight once a year, part of the rise in the ring frequency.
For example, the upcoming opponent Issa took last September.
Taurulla, in turn, was last year's three matches.
Now the front is the current year, another struggle.
Between the pace of change has been pregnant.
I have in recent years been working out and been in good shape all the time.
However, I've been just fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change for a moment the landscape.
I was in Espoo working out and I got the joy of doing the back.
We got a really good workout, when there was one guy from Sweden.
Training was a great help, because on Saturday from kouvola to be prepared for a physical struggle.
I've been working out the same size opponents and practice can match.
Can take with is the 32-year-old päätaktiikka.
Keep hitting sensibly.
If you get a chance, I left the course to take the plot.
Down entries will not be given for free, because they consume the most.
Macau to attract in the past in China take failure Taurua.
It is reportedly china's Las Vegas.
I believe that the front is a big and fancy evening party.

”This is a crucial moment in the HIV in the fight against”, says national AIDS organization director Deborah Gold.
”If PrEP-medication targeted to those who need it and those at risk, it can have a transformative effect on the English of the HIV epidemic.
Since September, the risk receive the NHS funded trial through the drug, the use of which they can decide independently without the need to negotiate with your partner. It has an empowering effect, which will improve very many people's lives.
This was welcome news.”
”The important thing now is to ensure that the experiment will be launched quickly in the whole country, and no one risk group are excluded from it,” said Terrence Higgins foundation director Ian Green.
”Try to use PrEP-medicine has acquired, and soon we will be able to protect ten thousand risk people against HIV infection.”
”PrEP-try to start is a welcome event, which was prolonged in vain for several months the government's dawdling,” said the shadow cabinet health minister Sharon Hodgson.
”We have evidence that the drug can be a epochal impact on our work, we are doing HIV prevention and this threat of the disease spreading to stop.
Try to help us understand better the PrEP-the drug real benefits.
Now it is important that the experiment will be launched as soon as possible throughout the country. Thus, we can protect HIV exposure and get one step closer to a situation where the HIV spread in the society has managed to stop.”
Quality of life: the intermediate layer and smart interior solutions are made from a small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Real estate home renovation enthusiastic former banker Joanne Leigh moved to Knightsbridge in the residential area of Earl's court located in the smaller apartment in 2014.
The apartment is a queen anne period style of the house on the first floor. Renovation success that Joanne is not yet packed your stuff and moved.
”Before this, I lived with my ex in knightsbridge with a significantly larger apartment,” Joanne told me.
”I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went here housing the screen and noticed that the rooms were as high as those then in my apartment.
Fell in love immediately and made an offer the same day.”
After about 90 square meter apartment has experienced a complete makeover.
It was a two-room apartment with bedroom only the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space, as well as the intermediate layer, so that the height of the room was utilised.
”I wanted space, large windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands,” he said.
He hired the work of Erfan Azadin Notting Hill location the Duck & Shed -design office. Erfan was given the task to take advantage of the almost four-meter high rooms and create housing, which would not only remodeling and sales destination, but home.
The height of the room is not quite enough for two overlapping mode, so the challenge was to build the intermediate layer, which fit into the stand.
The solution requires erfan from creative thinking.
”Steel structures are pretty complex.
Facilities should be arranged to overlap so that they do not need to cower.
Structures had to be adapted so that the height is just right, as well as their on that below.”
Erfan was able to invest in mode overlap of the two täyskorkeaa room fascinates with its details.
Intermediate floor opens Retrouviuksen copper lattice-window in an elegant lounge.
Mirror gold capped furniture, silver effects, and Serge Mouille vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
Mirror the use of that theatricality, a feeling of space and light.
A short canal at each end of the mirror you get the aisle to affect real longer.
The kitchen in between the mirror is like a window, which opens a view to another room.
The entrance mirror of the pintaisina of furniture has storage space for Joanne's aterimille and glass goods.
Elegance add to it that the kitchen gets hidden, when not in use.
Folding doors equipped with kitchens are not a new solution,
but Joanne's kitchen is unique in the fact that the door is lifted up in the same way as a garage door.
”It requires a bit of planning”, Erfan told the steel-reinforced veneer surfaced MDF door.
”It is balanced, i.e. it slides when lifting very easily in place.”
Rational use of space and storage planning with Joanne got 16 extra square feet, another bedroom and a better layout.
”Housing for sale area will solve – or real estate valuation”, Erfan said.
”The basic case, the realtor walks in to the apartment and calculates the price on basis of area.”
Joanne's apartment in the surface area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring to a state of luxury.
”A resident is in contact with the housing material, and emotional bond to the apartment was in part based on them”, Erfan said.
”No one attached the walls to pass electrical wiring.
They are important but not in the same way.”
Joanne's apartment is an example that good design and the additional squares can make a basic apartment for an exceptional fine.
Then it may happen that the apartment no longer want to move out.

She's raising our sweet chili sauce
In the summer of 1996 the Gulf in the square appeared in the stalls, which sold thai food.
Located in lahti, did not dare to taste, but walked over.
The stalls in the food sold Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, familiar in Spain.
He didn't know how much of finland, not finns at that time still part of the thai.
Because the people did not dare to go to eat, Spain offers a free sample.
Thus he taught lahti residents to eat thai food, spring roll at a time.
Countries countries, he said.
I got a heartbeat on the hook.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997 Spain opened a Bay store in the hall thai ruokalansa.
There were two small tables, the restaurant seats must be less than 20.
He taught us not only to eat thai food, also sit strangers next.
When there is hunger and seats are limited, can not leave an empty chair for himself and a guest.
Little by little we got to know better and we became friends.
I finally sit down over a nice plate with a dictionary to learn the thai language.
Two years go to store management side, but then the restaurant had to change, because self-made spice pastes, I hear they smell too much in the hall.

Paul didn't want to leave the family business since 2014, but the difference in bitter controversy.
The brothers and their mother Let the jointly owned 38 properties, with a value of more than half a billion dollars. The family began to accumulate property, when they bought the store Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family set up there Westcoat Jeans-trade, which expanded 160 the movement of the chain.
Store chain was sold for 85 million dollars in 1999.
The money was used in real estate, and the family now owned offices, the real estate development area of Brunswick and the Sorrento and apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centers.
The family of her late father's agreement with Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul about a third of the company's assets. Paul described his father ”in the family to become the driving force and central figure.”
Court documents according to the asset allocation ratio means that Colin owns the real estate, about 316 million dollars worth of and Paul about 176 million dollars in value.
Paul is not satisfied with the real estate and the distribution of the money.

The case was discussed last Friday for the first time in the supreme court a number of mediation companies.
The brothers are arguing now also about who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has shut him out of business.
Colin says this is not true. He accuses Paul of some real estate from poor management.
Colin writes in one of the first affidavit for your patents, that he would like to find a way out.
”Italian traditions in accordance with the family is important to me,” Colin said in a statement.
Case expenses are constantly increasing. Sworn statements, emails, and reports are hundreds of pages. Case has responded to Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer such as consultant companies as well as the country's best and most sophisticated lawyers such as Allan Myers.
Let De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, which are based on milk bars and sweet shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought the trade Brunswickista.
They were used as collateral family purchased the Collingwood estate, where Colin is based on the family of the first denim store.
Colin explains the creation of the trade ”high school last year, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)”.
Let De Lutis told reporters that she and in 2012, the dead Luigi wanted to transfer the property to his sons amicably.
”Luigi said often, you don't want the brothers to end up in court”, Anna writes in a statement.
A family of two other boys, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis group's business. Colin, according to Mark received $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars to failing companies.
Paul, according to Luke and Mark are ”bitter departure in economic terms”.
Colin has kept a low profile, even if is a former Australian football league club's board member and tv star Eddie Mcguire's best friend this year 2015 appeared in the biography.

Only Colin answered. He told the text message that I can comment on the matter, because it is dealt with in court.
”It is very sad that your brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family name according to the legal battle,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to refuse his brother's demands.
”Our father wouldn't want us fighting this way,” Colin continues and hope remains that the issue is resolved.
Friday, the hope seemed to turn off.
”The issue we resolved in court in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff intends to limit the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly finally manages.
First.
Poltica magazine, according to the White house new chief of staff intends to limit the president Trump media management and news monitoring, so that the boss is not put so often into trouble.
Reporter Josh Dawsey reports:
”When the White house new chief of staff John F. Kelly conference management staff with the first day on the job, he took up the central problem, which he intends to solve: he intends to limit the president Donald Trump information.
Kelly told White house employees that all data – so printed as briefings heard, a fortiori must pass through him, because the president makes better decisions when they receive good information.”
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has decades of relationship with tv – and as president, he still considers a lot of tv.
”If a presidential candidate Trump is upset by the unfair media coverage, her support to show that sympathetic media handled things more equitable”, Trump's campaign advisor working with Sam Nunberg told the Politico newspaper in February.
Politicon reporter Tara Palmer wrote at the time that ”the sixth former campaign worker, according to Trump Twitter in terms of managing, it is essential that his personal media stream in the steady praise of power”.
Clear.
But it is ridiculous to claim that Trump's Twitter usage would never be out of control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something we others don't know – maybe Trump's tweets would be without their efforts have been even more ferocious.
We most likely will never get to know what kind of messages trump a night without sending.
If his staff is even a few times been able to prevent her from causing problems, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump caused a stir.
The problem is partly due to the fact that the White house has competing factions that try to run their case by giving Trump the information that supports their view. That information may be reliable or not.
In may, Politico wrote that the counselors give intentionally to the president questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher told of one incident:
”Trump's current and former employees say that he can fly into a rage enormous newspaper clippings, which he is judged – especially if they are told the harmful information leaks. Then he just has to get to know where information comes from.
It happened at the end of February, when someone gave teasingly to the president a copy of the online provocateur Charles C. Johnson on GotNews.com-site news, which accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh number of White house information leaks.
Johnson was removed permanently from Twitter harassment, and he had previously been spreading false accusations and withdraw them later. He also failed to put forward concrete evidence.
Despite that, Trump had begun the story after reading the questions from the staff of Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff reinc is Priebus and the White house staff secretary Rob Porter ”had tried to introduce Trump went to the document management system”.
And what was the result?
Kelly trying to the same three months later.
Maybe he proved to be more effective as a leader than Priebus, but Trump is still my impulsive self and his aides continue to run their own affairs.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's task extremely difficult.

Monty Widenius spend half the time coding, so online keep order - he deploy the database using, for example, Wikipedia and Google
Says try MariaDB to develop "the world's fastest growing" open-source database.
Encoded by entrepreneur Michael "Monty" widenius, the founder of MariaDB's main product will not cost users anything, and it can develop through the internet anyone with a good programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are the Finnish database of users, but paying customers they don't necessarily have.
Databases with the help of huge mass of data keep in order and quickly available.
If you use, for example Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.'s, they will take advantage of MariaDB's or MySQL's database.
"All the information, which is not the image format comes from the database, and the image you have linked to there," explains Widenius.
MariaDB's technology leader, acting as Widenius spend about half the time to encode.
Kauniaisista hands of telework man should contribute to the care of the fact that the internet runs smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database MySQL's together with the Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company that Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and a year later the software giant Oracle swallowed Sun for 7.4 billion.
When an Oracle transaction, a large part of MySQL's developers announced she was leaving.
"They didn't want to do the work Oraclelle, which gave no sure promise of MySQL's future", Widenius recalls.
He was already at this stage established the company, which began to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work die.
I hired from sun a couple of ten of the best developers and ensure that code continuity will be secured by the same guys that created it were.
Because MySQL is open source database, MariaDB was able to develop on their own branch.
The name just had to change.
MariaDB:no code development freedom to oversee the founding of the foundation.
"MySQL's during these checks does not do," Widenius frets.
Although many of you have heard Widenius and MySQL:billion store, few finns know anything about MariaDB.
"Last year, our growth rate has been around 50% per year", says MariaDB:no cfo Kenneth Paqvalén.
Growth focused on MariaDB doesn't make a profit, and Paqvalén is tight-lipped company id number.
That much she reveals that in the current fiscal year MariaDB estimated to receive 20 million orders.
Because the database is free, the company has developed around it services that enterprise customers are willing to pay.
MariaDB also helps for database replacement, which can be more than a year contract, if the customer has used a closed database.
MySQL to replace MariaDB:a hen will succeed instantly, because they are versions of each other.
Inter alia, the Spanish operator Telefónica and South-east asia's largest bank DBS are MariaDB's paying customers.
The most popular cloud services, like amazon's AWS, microsoft's Azure, alibaba's Cloud, provide customers with MariaDB.
While MariaDB spreads to new users automatically the Linux operating system distribution packages, of which MariaDB is largely replaced MySQL's.
Although we are a small company, we have connections to larger gamblers are.
"Our customers are among the world's largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks", Paqvalén list.
Database the market there are still oracle's, microsoft's, IBM's and SAP's like a giant closed database in their.
Oraclelle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although research firm Gartner, according to the biggest database companies have in recent years lost market share, revenue as measured in MariaDB:no such gamblers are still negligible, although the fast-growing sinttejä.
About 50 billion dollar database market, open source databases do not maintain an even billion.
Open source weight value does not, however, be measured only in monetary terms, because the majority of users do not pay for this software any.
Research company Gartner predicts that by 2018, companies are already developing more than 70% of the internal applications of the open database on top of.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would then be changed to open or transitional would have at least been started.
Big companies do not get new customers, because most of the selects the next open source.
This has led to the fact that the commercial database of the license fee you have to jump through the roof.
Companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller client number", Widenius reflect.
Because of the closed database switching is a hassle, the majority of client companies have swallowed the price rises obediently.
"A lot of clients, for whom the transition is really difficult, because their old apps and other are closed in the database to catch up," Widenius said.
He still believes that the customer dimension is becoming full.
When license fees are rising every year, the customer will move to sooner or later open source database.
Price is 10-20 per cent previously, and the service better, because the customer may wish to easily switch to another database.
Many companies have besides already facing great system changes, when they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time many exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB got a 25 million euro loan from the European investment bank EIB:from.
It was the largest EIB nordic countries issued by the funding for growth never.
The company has worldwide, approximately 115 employees, and to hire now add.
One of the reasons the EIB's financing was MariaDB's impact on public it procurement.
The company has public sector clients, for example, in the Uk and Germany.
The public sector in Europe to pay billions of euros in annual databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use this tax money effectively," Paqvalén says.
Widenius of annoying how in Finland, you spend money, say, in closed health care systems, while open systems are cheaper, nor does the subscriber have a single software company's mercy.
Some say that open source is an ideology, but I think it is a better way to do the code.
Community to help and will do that which is not self-invented or be able to do.
55-year-old Widenius heard another Finnish Linux developer Linus Torvalds, along with best-known open source promotion.
Widenius help other companies to develop workable business models for open source.
I still like 4-5 speech every year across the world on this topic.

which announced on Thursday its new rules unnecessary but acceptable, because they do not cause ”significant changes or obstacles” organization of rescue operations.
Operations manual compliance with the refuse of among them is Nobel prize-winning Doctors without borders.
Minniti, in turn, noted that the rescue will arrived in Italy for the number of migrants has dropped sharply in recent weeks, what she likes as evidenced by the fact that the actions of the Libyan coast guard to strengthen and the cooperation of local city leaders began to produce results.
”In recent days we have begun to see the light the end of the tunnel”, the minister said.
He revealed that the plan is to continue this month to discuss the Libyan city manager with economic development projects, as well as Chad, Niger and Mali, with measures that can reduce Europe towards the number of refugees leaving.

Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for suicide yllyttäne of text messages
In massachusetts a woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and phone calls, which she was instigated by her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, carried out 15 months of his sentence in prison and five years probation.
Carter was convicted in June of manslaughter. Her boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13.7.2014.
”My family is broken”, Conrad's father, said Thursday of the session.
”My son was my best friend.”
Carter appealed the judgment and had to wait application processing free.
Threatened with 20 years in prison, but his lawyer his according to both Carter and Roy to suffer from mental health problems.
Red pants and a cream-colored blouse dressed Carter listened to his sentence with folded hands tearful gaze to the ground created.
”He did kill Conrad Roy”, the prosecutor said to the court.
”He decided Conrad's life to improve theirs.
He did not take work responsibility”, the prosecutor continued.
”He has not shown remorse.”
Carter's attorney says the incident was due to ”terrible circumstances, that Carter deeply regrets”.
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, was of the opinion that carter's ”age or maturity level, and even mental health problems have a significant effect on he did what he did”.
The prosecutor read Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy's opinion, where the mother told reporters that ”not a day goes by, don't mourn my beloved son's death.
I want, that he can be proud of me and how to cope with all this. I try my best to comfort her sisters in this pain, that we will always carry.”

”It is painful to lose people, which has been in my life every day since I was born. That pain doesn't let up ever,” Camdyn said.
The incident seems to have become a precedent, because in the state of Massachusetts there is no law, according to which suicide incitement should be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old, when Roy found in a car of carbon monoxide poisoning dead in 2014.
The case attracted nationwide attention when it was revealed that Carter was the text messages incited her boyfriend to commit suicide.
”Hang yourself, jump off a roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways,” Carter wrote in many of the messages that he had sent to Roy died prior to the two weeks. Roy was at that time vacationing with his family.
Just a little bit before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote: ”You have to do it, Conrad” and ”You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy”.
Judge Moniz said that Carter will get the attention of Roy's death. The judge ordered that Carter does not get the benefit of the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided experts ' opinions.
Only a few have defended Carter. One defense of Amanda Knox, 30, who was sentenced british roommate's murder in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's writing, in which he stated: ”Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison.”
Nato secretary general: Russia worst since the cold war
A military alliance between Nato and Russia have deteriorated markedly, commenting on the Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the Ukraine conflict.
I think I can say that nato's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been end of the cold war, Stoltenberg said on CNN in an interview.
The cold war is over, I hope that we can strive for close cooperation with Russia.
But especially the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the Russian East-Ukrainian region due to the continued instability to nato's relationship with Russia has worsened considerably.
Stoltenberg said Nato is still committed to working so that the tensions to a peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage with russia in the political dialogue to avoid the situation escalating and a new cold war.
Before stoltenberg's comments, Us president, Donald Trump had said the U.S. and Russia drifted up perilously poor level.
Trump calls to thank countries bad between the congress, which approved last week a new anti-Russian sanctions.
Audi makes changes to the 850 000 diesel engine car manufacturers experienced a setback due to
The day before the Audi's announcement, BMW has offered to update over 350 000 car software.
BMW's director of the said company to believe that ”it makes sense, there are more options than driving”. He referred to european cities, including BMW's home city of Munich who are considering diesel vehicles restricting or prohibiting the use.
Daimler announced Tuesday to make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines diesel to reduce emissions.
None of the companies didn't talk back invitation.
European car manufacturers have marketed heavily in diesel vehicles in use in Europe and the united states carbon dioxide emissions targets.
Diesel engines for nitrogen oxide emissions shall be considered to cause cancer and asthma.
Emissions neutralising equipment installation costs increased, making cars is difficult to price competitively.
German car manufacturers are to be observed strictly, and chancellor Angela Merkel has accused major car companies follow the contours and the problems of ignoring.
The company you are trying to avoid volkswagen's errors. Volkswagen install cars cheat devices that reduced emissions in accordance with the provisions of your tests. In ordinary driving the emissions were higher.
Several of volkswagen's leaders has been prosecuted in the united states, but managers work investigating both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, Audi's engine development department of the former thermodynamics of answer leader arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pami is Italian, so he can be extradited to the united states possible for trial.
Earlier this year Audi was drawn according to Volkswagen the criminal investigation. Authorities suspect that Audi had installed in their cars system, which was able to circumvent the European emission requirements. The accusation is based on similar research in the united states.
Audi's investigation can significantly impair volkswagen's position: the luxury car manufacturer to share volkswagen's profit is disproportionately large.

Climate change poses a threat to the Provencal lavender
Lavender has become the South of France provence area of the symbol, but now that the threat of climate change.
Lavender had been reduced by drought and disease carrying insects. Scientists and farmers are trying frantically to find a solution to your problem.
”Lavender is downright endangered Provence region, because it has suffered in recent years, the effects of climate change. With them, the spring and particularly autumn rainfall has decreased markedly,” said provence located in the agriculture-specialized CRIEPPAM-research institute expert Eric Chaissea.
”This shortens the lavender to live.
In addition, the drought has brought the region a lot of small cicadas, which is spread by micro bacteria.”
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly desired perfume and cosmetics ingredients.
”Long cones and large in lieu of flowers we now have smaller flowers, which are weakly developed or deteriorated or missing altogether,” Chaissea said.
”In other words, essential oil-containing components is less.”
Solution sought for efficient irrigation, by slowing down soil moisture evaporation and spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water mix. In addition, developing drought better resistant varieties.
Supplier murder embodies a growing threat to Mexico
Once a week magazine Riodoce newspaper delivery usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the journal deals with the latest cases related to organised crime, corrupt authorities, and an endless drug war in Sinaloa state.
Today, however, the safety of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been advised to change the daily routine.
Two experienced journalists will discuss about which one is safer: leave the kids home or take them to delivery, which was made in a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written to the front of the room in the blackboard three words: opponents, neutral, ally.
They asked suppliers to name each group. Evidence is not required, observations and sensations sufficient.
On the board write the kind of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists name, which I suspected to be the government or the drug cartels payroll. They are criminals who are doing the Mexican chaos news reporting life-threatening.
Violence is constant, and more and more often attacks the targets are journalists. Committee to protect journalists says at least 25 journalists have been murdered after president Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. Federal patronage is 589 attacks and threats have been subject of the supplier. In the current year have been murdered at least seven journalists in seven states.
The latest victim is Javier Valdez Cárdenas, Riodocen founder, editor and source of inspiration.
”The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of the many drug the crowd the power of the relevant books.
She is missed deeply, though he is present everywhere. Riodocen the facade of the building covered with a huge picture, where Valdez looks like a middle finger. In the photo reads: ”Right”. In the thirties reporters Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts, which adorn valdez's smiling face. Valdez's glasses and signature panama hat.
The meeting will be held in less than two months after valdez's death. Editors discuss common trauma, the nightmares, about that insomnia of the performer and the paranoia started to blow past her fears.
In 2010, established the federal prosecutor's office in particular, suppliers of cases for processing, but the committee to protect journalists, so far, has raised only two charges.
Journalists ' murderers will only rarely brought to justice, as well as thousands of drug trafficking and organized crime each year related to the murder only a few end up in court.
Riodocen the editors intend to continue the Sinaloa violence in writing, even though they are grief-stricken and the situation is even more dangerous.
Created according to the safety meetings is of little use, because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
”This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time,” he said.
”We can't trust anybody so long as we don't know why this happened.”
Valdez had removed Riodocen the delivery of the state capital of culiacan in the morning 15.5.2017.
He had driven a red Toyotallaan just a couple of blocks, when two men stopped him and forced out of his car and fired twelve shots. The number is associated with the presumably journal name: Riodoce means the twelfth of the river.
The shooter drove away from valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was a 50-year-old.
He is survived by his wife and two adult children.
Rumors move fast and prolific are freely Culiacan.
Valdez died from being quiet as a mouse.
Sinaloa has been mexico's bloodiest battlefields after Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the united states in January. Rival factions want to fill the void.
The sinaloa streets shoot someone or several people to death every day, and the cemetery is a drug barons of the decorative two-storey tomb of a building that are larger than many of the house.
The coast located in the state is ”calm” when only one cartel dominates the port and the drug trafficking routes to the united states.
Although Valdez was well aware of their job hazards, Riodocen founder and leader, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feel guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to valdez's murder.
In February Riodoce published Damaso Lopez interview. He leads a competing faction which is waging war with Guzman against the boy.
Thing might piss Guzman boys: gang members suspected customers buy a magazine every number as soon as the leaves come to points of sale.
The second error was that the Valdez forced to leave the country after another the same story published by the newspaper was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered as a turning point journalists towards violence against.
He had survived so many, that his friends and colleagues couldn't be afraid anymore for him.
He had a long career in Noroeste, when he decided in 2003 to establish a five with a colleague Riodocen. Journal of the shares were sold at $ 50.
The sinaloa ”was impossible to do journalism without addressing the drug problem,” Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to feel courageous and honest thing, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
The journalists appreciated the chance to publish a hard class investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated with the journal thing, that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, the Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for reporting themselves in Latin America.
The same year, Valdez received the committee to protect journalists international press freedom award for courage to follow the Mexican drug trade story fixedly.
He openly admitted he was afraid.
”I want to be able to continue my life,” he said while receiving the committee to protect journalists award.
The drug trade is the Sinaloa ”way of life,” Valdez said Rompeviento TV interview last October.
”The supplier shall be taken against him falls the task – or play dumb.
I don't want that anyone needs to ask me where I was, when here were sown death – why I didn't tell what was going on?”
Riodocen staff miss Valdez – joker, who swore like a docker. They miss their friends, which always got a hug and advice. They need teachers who know how to cope with.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He went to the delivery the opposite of El Guayabo in the bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask, will they routines his fate.
Colleagues death has got them also consider how they can best do their job and stay alive.
”Criminals do not like it, if we deal with the case when their women and children and their pure focus of their business, their secret drug trafficking airstrip.
They left stuff outside”, Bojorquez says.
It meant the best of circumstances, strong self-censorship and self-protection,
own instincts to trust.
If you feel that something is not right, gotta stay away.
The problem is Riodocen supplier Andres Villarrealin according to it, that ”the impression can be deceiving, and so was Javier's case”.
The old rules no longer apply to the Sinaloa, and they do not apply to Tamaulipasin, in Veracruz, at guerrero and in other states, which is dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The business environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones weren't allowed in the room where Riodocen safety training was held. A few days earlier had become evident that only governments sell aisles spyware had been monitored by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building two police officers had sought the tree shade shelter in 40 degree helteeltä.
The state government had ordered them to guard the Riodocen premises, which are located nelikerroksisessa building the middle class in Culiacan area.
Some journalists speculate, half in jest, whether just these two police officers to 50% among, which the governor of the state does not have reliable.
It had been months since reporters had been to drug gangs by controlling the mountainous countryside.
This week's number Riodocen delivery planned three cover story.
Boxing the magnitude of Julio Cesar chavez's brother had been killed by the Sinaloa.
The magazine will also reveal that government spending was focused on the governor's home town.
In addition, together with culiacan in the most expensive restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor's office, was kidnapped a group of people.
It wasn't official information, who was kidnapped and how, so I would proceed with caution: everyone in the city knows that the restaurant was as well as drug traffickers that the authorities ' popularity.
Reporter learned from the public documents, that the restaurant was registered with the ruling institutional revolution party (PRI) politician's name. The PRI has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
The governor has recently been accused of corruption a lot of publicity cases.
Villarreal asked journalists to write from past cases in the same place. In one of those ”El Chapo” Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid a military raid.
A few months earlier readers would have known he'd get Valdez's column reliable information about the kidnapping.
”In the past we would already know what had happened,” said the 46-year-old Villarreal, who has got a slim body due to its construction, the nickname ”El Flaco”, Crepe.
”Now all connections to the data sources we are broken.”
Valdez's office is modified for storage, where maintaining of the persecution of journalists opposite signs and stickers. Journal employees have received a new, unexpected task: they have become freedom riders activists.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took with him a few signs when leaving the next morning, the local prosecutor's office to the foreground the demonstration, which were attributed again to a new supplier murder.
Salvador Adams disappeared in the western Michoacanin in the state for three days Valdez after the murder.
After he disappeared, was found burned bodies, which authorities did the DNA test on the basis of is Adams.
Journalists are beginning to protest more loudly throughout the country. Demonstrations on the sidewalk and the buildings appeared in the ”SOS Press” -texts.
Today the head of the Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to get international support for the Valdez incident investigation.
Valdez the day after the murder, Ramirez met with Sinaloa governor and accused authorities of journalists of spying and killing, therefore, that they are telling the truth.
He has since requested that he be transferred out of the government handling things, because he is worried about it, you can't anger to be objective.
Valdez was repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists are surrounded by organized crime, crime allows the authorities and indifferent to society.
Last, before his book Narkojournalismi Valdez writes that the drug gangs are killing journalists, but they are also being killed politicians and security forces command, in agreement with organized crime.
Article 19 -control group, more than half of the journalists in the last year the attacks were the police and the authorities.
”In mexico, people will be silenced by killing”, Ramirez said.
Murder has a crippling effect.
No one will ever forget the blogger Maria Elizabeth your mac's death in the north Tamaulipasin limit in the state six years ago.
His body was with the Zetas, signed by the message: ”I'm here to write my due.”
His severed head was next to the computer keyboard and headphones.
Part of the magazine has decided to cease its activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the north, Chihuahua border in the state of correspondent Miroslava Breach in march, after the murder.
Part of the continued activities, such as Nuevo Laredo El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a front page drug cartels message: ”What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have fled osavaltioistaan or the whole country.
The decision is difficult.
Exile is difficult to find a job, and all the time must be careful.
Sometimes criminals are looking for the vendor hands, as apparently was the photographer Ruben Espinosalle, who was murdered four women in Mexico City located in the housing in the year 2015, three months after he had fled to Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra – where have the times to become a poet – granted, that drug store write scared.
”I became a journalist, because Mexico is going to hell,” he says.
Some time ago Riodocen reporters sat down on Friday at midnight, on the delivery front on the sidewalk with a beer, when the leaves of the new number had been completed. Suddenly their phones began to color message sign.
Rival gangs and security forces between shooting in Mazatlan beach resort was dead 19 people.
The war accelerated, as the area joined the cartel in the messages promised.
Reporters put news Riodocen website on a sidewalk con.
Home had to be redone the next day.
Sirens were howling nearby – again a new shooting scene.
Bojorquez look at delivery of the security officers:
if they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodocen delivery continues the journal of the murdered based on the tradition of this massive shape in the image below, where the man looks like a middle finger to all the Sinaloa.
Bojorquez said, you can't even consider winding down. ”How can I abolish the magazine, when our intern asked from the street to do a story on the same day, when Javier was murdered?”
Hannu Manninen of the olympic project started a huge setback - "a Hard place"
In April, the 39 years met Hannu Manninen party remained short, as a professional pilot started to prepare for the olympic season.
Training season, however, started disastrously, when Manning came down with the flu.
It began a long sickness period, which stretched to nearly five weeks.
May go to virtually all get sick, too.
First it was the flu and finally, a children's disease as an ear infection, which I had to eat a course of antibiotics.
I was able to do the planned exercises only ten percent.
I can't remember when I've last been around for a long time sick.
It was a hard place, when I didn't get to take advantage of the training enthusiasm, Manninen told the Evening Said.
Test results collapse
The 2007 world champion got my learner's permit until the second week of June, which is reflected in the 12. June in the Racing and top sports research centre SKUA:no roll mat test.
In the test the athlete to ski roller skis on the treadmill, the speed of which is grown every three minutes.
Every three minutes after the mat stops about ten seconds, and the tester took the athlete's finger from the needle of the lactic acid sample.
Last autumn I carpet in 32 minutes, but now remain in only 28 minutes.
Come on, Manninen tells.
Better direction
After a difficult start, Manninen told me he stayed healthy.
I've done a versatile calm aerobic exercises, which I have sought to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now the back is a really good five-week period.
Midsummer was also a week and a half holiday flight in business.
I have time with my family to visit also the cottage.
Last season Manninen participated in just four world cup competition before the Lahti world championship games.
The best result was seen immediately in the opening race, when Manninen rose to a peak of skiing on the 18:th.
Guidelines pulled
Manninen and national team head coach Petter Kukkonen are done first until February to extend the training and competition plan.
We get now a different rhythm of training compared to last season.
The first snowfall after the world cup Ruka would be three world cup race of the weekend.
In December, the purpose should be involved in at least one world cup this weekend, maybe Ramsaun.
At the end of January plans should be included even Seefeldissä.
I hope after the name found on the olympic team list, Manninen said.
Pyeongchangin olympics would manninen for a career sixth olympic winter games.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City 2002, a gold in the team competition celebrated nummela types of underline.
The dinosaur was enemies disguising
At first it looks scary statue.
Now researchers have revealed the first survey results of canadian mine workers from finding a rhino-sized creature, which was so well preserved that experts are calling it the dinosaurs Mona Lisa.
It was preserved so well that scientists were able even to define, that its scaly skin was reddish-brown and it had been ”problematic past”.
Current Biology magazine, it is the best preserved of the armored dinosaur and the world's best of their species representatives.
The newly found fossil is nodosaurus, who lived in the cretaceous period in the middle 110-112 million years ago.
Researchers consider this amazingly well-preserved fossils of the really significant discovery.
The National Geographic magazine, an armored herbivore is a species in the best preserved fossils.
It is found in Canada, Northern Alberta, located on the Suncor Millennium mine 21.3.2011, and found the day was Shawn Funk -the name of the miner.
He hit something, which didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to examine the discovery more closely.
The rock found fossils sent Tyrrellin royal paleontologist of the museum.
There the beast was dug out of a six-year period 1 100 pounds lohkareesta.
Hard work the results are now visible.
”If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping,” said science author Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher Tyrrellin in the royal museum.
”It remains for science to the history of the dinosaurs as the Mona lisa, one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs.
Leather studies found out that the meat-eating dinosaurs were likely to have a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it was armor and it resembles a walking tank.
Its red and white armor to disguise it from predators, and protected, also on top of the darker and under the lighter coloring, which still occur in many animals.
According to experts, it was able to better blend with its surroundings and avoid enemies, larger dinosaurs.
110 million-year-old nodosaurus headlines in may, and it is now exhibited Tyrrellin royal in paleontology in the museum.
Scientists have given it the name Borealopelta mark mitchell, a museum technician Mark Mitchell. Mitchell part of the team, which took over 7 000 hours to dig the dinosaur out.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well, that Mitchell and international researchers in the team have been able to determine that the body of the scales and the armor pattern and shape.
They found that it protected the animal in the world is still the general coloring, in which the body is on the darker and beneath paler.
The findings were still a surprise, because Borealopelta is significantly higher than the present animals, which is the equivalent coloring.
It can be concluded that the meat-eating dinosaurs to prey on it to the extent that evolution favored the survival as a means of hiding instead of fighting.
Current animals for example deers, zebras and armadillo have a similar coloring. They are considerably smaller and therefore easier prey, suggesting that nodosauruskin was seriously threatened.
”A large, heavily armoured dinosaur of the predatory tell you how dangerous the cretaceous period the dinosaurs were,” Brown said.
Nodosauruksen flakes of organic compounds chemical analysis revealed that the leather was red-brown.
Scientists continue to nodosauruksen studied in order to draw conclusions about its life. They examined, inter alia, that the bowel content in order to find out what he ate at the last supper.
The researchers believe that it fell to his death into the river and drifted to sea, where it sank, lying on his back on the sea bottom.
In alberta at that time was as warm as today in Florida, and the rivers and the sea probably extended much further than today.
”This nodosaurus is actually significant because of its scaly leather is preserved and it is preserved also in three dimensions the original form,” Brown said.
”That's why it looks almost the same as the early cretaceous period
Its conceptualization does not require much imagination: if you squint a little the eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping.”
The cretaceous period was the flying, giant two-legged, meat-eating dinosaur era.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, i.e. millions of years Borealopeltaa in the past, its mighty predecessors may have to hunt this armored dinosaur.
Tyrannosaurus rex's predecessor's include, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, about 11.5 meters long, six ton monster.
Nodosauruksen researchers the latest findings is published in Current Biology journal. They believe that Borealopelta washed out to sea after death and mummification in the mud.
It is found in Canada, Northern Alberta, located on the Suncor Millennium mine 21.3.2011, and found the day was Shawn Funk -the name of the miner.
The museum says it is the world's best-preserved armored dinosaur furred and panssareineen the muzzle of the hips.
Nodosaurukset were, on average, five meters long and weighing up to 1300 pounds.
Their stage of rise for two feet spikes.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian pass current in Western Canada through, until the flooded river was carrying it out to sea.
Its armor is preserved the small details right down to the sea in the underwater tomb.
Its fossil oituna remnants have been preserved so well that the leather is still left in the armor of the kuoppaisissa plates along its skull.
Michael gresh you wrote in National Geographic, that such retention is ”as rare as winning the lottery.
What more detail you look at it, it's amazing a bitch it seems.
Its skull armor kuoppaisissa discs is still fossilised leather.
Its right front leg is on its sides, five toes upward.
Be able to calculate also the foot of the base of the scales.”
How one activist to learn to answer the question: to whom the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell shocked deeply 9.8.2014.
He had arrived days earlier to New York from his home in St. Louis and sat down on airbnb-apartment in bed browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed the message a high school friend:
”The police just killed a 18-year-old youth, and his body is still on the street.”
Dazed, he noticed that nobody else had posted the same information on his feed. That's why he closed Facebook and opened a Twitter.
His your timeline there were a number of retweets from user @TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to St. Louis, residing rapper, who tweeted in real time Michael Brown's death. White police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown Fergusonissa in the state of Missouri.
This user had posted also a photo of Brown's lifeless body in the street, where it was left for four hours.
”This is incredible,” Ferrell think.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put the phone away. When he returned to Twitter later the same night, there was told the people the accumulation of Canfield Drive.
Users post images of the police barrier tapes, and the shout of the people as well as Brown's father, claiming to date to the man carrying the sign reading: ”Ferguson police just killed an unarmed son!”
Ferrell followed with real-time video images, with the police standing protesters in front of the barking dog.
He told me he saw also a video, where another police set his rifle and shouted: ”I'll Kill all of you... animals.”
”This is not normal,” Ferrell remembers that at its.
”It wasn't the kind of murder, which we are already accustomed and which could be said to be typical.
Then I felt a chill.
I was angry and I cried.”
He booked a return flight home the next day.
The plane landed at eleven o'clock at night. Ferrell went for a six-year-old daughter, his father and decided that they were going to ferguson was the next morning.
About what Ferrell and Ferguson happen in the next almost three years, has made a documentary film ”Whose Streets?”. It premiered in movie theaters 11.8.2017.
The film is a story of survival and protest, love and loss as well as strength and tenacity of the local people's point of view, who took to the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell ran toward Ferguson floral dress and it is compatible with the crown dressed with her daughter, they went to re-open the debate about ”what it is to live black and under what circumstances”. They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
”Do you remember when I told you how blacks have had to fight for the things that I believe?” Ferrell remembers, he said to his daughter.
”We're going to Ferguson, because the police kill 18-year-old boy, and it's not right.”
”I couldn't not to take a daughter with you,” Ferrell later told.
”The events of this day are... the past events of the climax.
My daughter has a right to know it and grow it.
He should have the capacity to activism and organization, but he must also be familiar with the black people live the experience of the different layers and conditions. And he has to know what we have to do to free ourselves, to release ourselves.
Although I have fortunately been able to protect her strident racism, he is still the same as the other black girls.
I feel that I would harm her, if I would protect him to reality.”
Their first stopping place Fergusonissa was South Florissant Road, which is located in the police station opposite. It became the activists of the camp, when they were waiting for information on handling the case and eventually found out that the police would not raise the charges.
There Ferrell and his daughter will go to help local entrepreneurs, who made packed lunches.
They packed up their lunch bags and share their demonstrators.
Ferrell began gradually approach activism in a new way.
”Aktivismini changed completely on August 9. the day after,” he says. While studying at Missouri university in St. Louis Ferrell was minority nurse students ' organization chairman. At that time, she focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
”I have no experience in the organization.
Somehow it just happened.”
Weeks later, Ferrell met the night rally Sabaa-Folayanin, documentary assistant director.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar ”wanted to simply tell” what was happening.
Ferrell's mind crept a doubt. He asked: ”do you really Want to be told what is happening, or do you want the story, that you can use?”
Doubt in the background were those countless times, when the local community had turned up people, usually white, who just wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
”We had heard that Fergusonissa born and grow treated with no common voice”, Folayan recently told in an interview. ”We wanted to do things differently.”
Folayan had already contacted the deputy director Damon Davis, known aktivismistaan death row inmates.
Davis ' involvement did Ferrell to go according to the project along with six other local. The film crew followed events in Brown's shooting in the years following.
”This is not a documentary, where someone talks to us or speaks on our behalf, but we'll talk,” Davis said.
”For me, was the most important thing, how the local people presented in the movie, because I presented the same way.”
Folayanin according to the purpose wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience, because they wanted to show that the people's movement ”is not about the charismatic leader, but from the community”. Ferrell turned out to be the image to be avoimimmaksi.
Therefore, in the document seen surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
”I feel pretty naked,” Ferrell laughed as he told how it felt to see the film for the first time.
”But understand that this work and the black human shooting requires a certain vulnerability.”
In addition to Ferrell's story once and that again at the centre of black queer women's role in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (#BlackLivesMatter), after the police had shot a black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012. The movement of the three based on the two relate to queer identity.
”Black queer women's leadership has kept the entire movement above,” Ferrell said. ”It is due to the fact that we have to fight continuously on several fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything.”
Folayan has the same opinion: ”the Movement indeed sustain black women, among them there are a lot of queer women.”
However, he stressed that Ferrelliä no selected document ”in themselves” queer identity.
”He's got the energy to mobilize,” Folayan said.
”However, it is not a coincidence that he was in the front line. Black queer women live many things at the intersection, and they have a lot in the game.
His energy is transmitted to the big screen.”
News description of the group you have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the community and the police are still strained.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of parole left. He was convicted of highway clog of the demonstration.
His description of the home corner in the socio-political atmosphere is short and concise: ”Entangled.”
Yet he continue to rely on the slogan that he learned outside ferguson's streets three years ago:
”It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can lose only your chains.”

Located in New York Fridman gallery is hung in the middle of the exhibition space of faces – white, black and brown faces, between which can more accurately view, to detect resemblance.
These 30 works are the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborgin made by the portrait, which is based on Chelsea manning's cheeks and hair and taken DNA samples.
Manning sent the samples to Fort Leavenworth, where he completed his 35-year sentence. Manning was convicted of classified diplomatic cables leaked on the WikiLeaks website.
Dewey-Hagborgin A Becoming Resemblance -the exhibition was opened 2.8.2017.
The background is two in correspondence to the Dewey-Hagborgin and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg work combines technology, information technology and art. Manning is a trans woman and seminal dissident, whose prison sentence Barack Obama reduced the term of office, his third, on the last day.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed manning's DNA algorithmically and created his genetic data, on the basis of the 30 portraits. They are sharp, if somewhat theoretical position to take a DNA editing information effectiveness, ambiguity, and the interpretations of the underlying cause-and-effect relationships, as well as identity.
Chelsea Manning, birth name Bradley Edward, has openly told the same to sit their women already in puberty. He was found in 2013, guilty of 20 offences, including espionage act violations, computer fraud and theft.
Prison convicted Manning was just one photo: a grainy, black and white selfie, which vaivautuneen conditions Manning sitting in the car in the driver's seat. He's wearing the platinum blonde wig, which became his trademark.
Dewey-Hagborgilla was in 2015 behind the great popularity received the Stranger Visions project, which he undertook in 2012.
There he created portraits of the forensic data. He got a DNA data, for example, tobacco-and gum and created a picture of what the people would have been able to show.
Then the artist received a e-mail Paper Magazine.
”They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a stand to the image,” Dewey-Hagborg told the new exhibition at the briefing.
Manning's didn't get to visit and she couldn't describe in prison. Thus, the press contact in Chelsea and asked, would you be interested in him to make Manning a DNA portrait.
The artist and his an imprisoned muusastaan come unexpectedly, correspondence friends. They were writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even make together with the Suppressed Images-comic book, with artwork shoi hotel Kanungo. It described a future where the president would be mitigated Chelsea verdict and he get to see the show.
In reality, Obama reduced manning's sentence just a few days your comic book published. It was a lucky coincidence, a kansas military prison spent seven hard years after.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is opened right now, when Donald Trump used his own war whistleblower and transgender soldiers and think of Twitter more and more new ways to strengthen their strong dichotomy, which he had in fact mitigated.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that ”everything has a purpose”.
The gallery wall is the artist's statement and its below manning's big name script, where the last name i:no point is the heart. In a statement, the artist called for an end to ”automatic for the breakdown, including gender, race, sexuality, and culture are established”.
The opposite wall is the Manning DNA sequence: a pencil written long C-, G - and A-of letters in queue.
This 200 letters or nucleotides, like the artist's used by the scientific definition – a combination of Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least in the biology below us.
”I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are gene perimältämme the same value and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretation”, Dewey-Hagborg said. The exhibition also his Spurious Memories-video works since 2007.
”DNA tells countless stories. Here is a display of the 30.”
Exhibition of the latest work is in their room: page Manning and Dewey-Hagborgin comic book.
In manning's figure soared to prison than King Kong, holding a megaphone.
”If they get you silence, they have won”, in the image read.
”Do not be silent ever.”
”The text is a letter which I received Manning”, the Philadelphia native artist told me.
”It is so impressive that I still get chills.”
Unlike the comic book was filmed, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning comes to the place, she greeted her own genetic information are based on the face as demonstrators, troops in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is deliberate, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, manning's DNA sequence is written in pencil at a height that is the same as his height (157,5 cm).
”The face was previously on the wall, but I wanted to bring the crowd feel,” Dewey-Hagborg says.
”I wanted to describe chelsea's generated by mass movement, which was also his release in the back.”

These startups will help your business to avoid uber's errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction ecommerce startup company, but the queries were not working.
Answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys are anonymous, some employees regard them with suspicion.
”Polls are simply not consistent and not objective”, Errett says. His hair care company Madison Reed focused on the online store. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
The market has increasingly become a new kind of hr startups-companies that help other companies figure out how their employees can.
They develop and license software, which can be used to measure employee engagement. Companies can do surveys and assign them to specific teams and groups, as well as provide their employees with anonymous notification services and, in some cases, direct access to senior management over the government.
”Your health can monitor Strava and Fitbit-like applications, but where is the corporate Fitbit?” asks the Redwood City location of the Glint-the startup's founder and ceo Jim Barnett. Glint provides businesses with analytics software employee commitment measurement.
Errett has used the glint of the software of three years. She told me she get more deeper insight into its employees ' thoughts and feelings.
The program you can do quick surveys and polls to certain teams. In addition, it may prepare a map, which sees at a glance which departments the workers are the most dissatisfied and who the leaders have received the weakest reviews. Based on these data, Errett has been able to drill down to the problem of the core.
Companies have realized that they have to follow the workplace culture, so they do not become the next Uber. Transport company around is seething ever since, when a former employee wrote on his blog culture, where employees are harassed and the problem of talk to be punished.
Glint like the startups for such defaults have attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry, whose value to Let's Talk Payments website according to rise above 118,7 billion dollars by 2020.
Denver Colorado state located in converce doubt is a startup that helps enterprises detect and prevent unauthorized use. The interest towards the company grew earlier this year when uber's reputation took a hit.
Convercentilla is almost 600 customers, which include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It recently made an agreement also uber with the.
Glint way to converce extender allows companies to make customized surveys, collect responses confidentially in real-time and identify problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behavior anonymously via text message.
And if the director has reason to suspect things are illegal actions, complaints go directly to the company board of directors.
”Public opinion has been supplanted by the authorities,” said Convercentin founder and ceo Patrick Quinlan.
He points out that if the company treats its employees poorly or act unethically, the consequences can be costly, although the authorities do not intervene wasn. Consumers can start to boycott the companies, and it can also lose workers and be sued.
Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25 000 employees in 500 locations. The company has used Convercentia more than a year, because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have easy connection to the main office.
Previously, the practice was that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he should first find out the phone number or email address, which was able to report to the main office. Then he had to make a formal complaint and I hope that it is taken seriously.
”It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience,” said Ruby Tuesday's legal director James Vitra. According to him, the workers ' complaints was difficult to follow.
Previously, the problem remained in hiding in another city or state in the working leaders. Now discrimination, harassment and unfair wages, such as problems can be detected and treated more quickly.
”I can get a more comprehensive and fuller understanding of the worker's reality,” said Vitra, which led to Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
”At the same time protecting our shareholders for their employment-related legal disputes.”
Quinlan says companies began to approach ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously, after auditing firm Arthur Andersen collapsed unethical activity the Enron scandal.
Until social media, companies realize that they could not longer prevent his dirty laundry in public debate.
”Hope was used as a strategy, before technology came to the ethics of supervision”, Quinlan said.
Glint and converce doubt offer its software as a service, the use of which will be charged on a regular basis.
It is capital investors approved by the business model and opportunity. As well as the glint in that Convercentilla is backed by private equity investors.
Converce doubt collected in February, $ 10 million in funding from Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, such as companies. It has collected capital amounting to 47 million dollars.
Glint got in November, 10 million Bessemer Venture partners from and has collected a total funding of $ 60 million.
The standings aren't a surprise, given the corporate, entrepreneurial culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, workers expect more jobs.
The silicon valley such as competitive market, good pay, and interesting projects are only the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they give their time truly useful to the company.
”The workers are committed more strongly to the success of the company, if they thrive in the company and feel that they are listened to and that their work is rewarding,” said employees ' remuneration and welfare LinkedIn-company director Nina McQueen.
Investors will receive returns, when companies become successful. Businesses thrive when employees undertake.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employees ' commitment, so it is no wonder that they interest investors.
The culture in the workplace, according to experts, knowledge workers ' commitment is important
but it is useless if it does not take measures.
If a company asks its employees for feedback, it can be regarded as a sign of change.
And if change does not come quickly enough or nothing will change, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
”If you ask four thousand proposals, must be prepared to four thousand of discussion,” says business management consultancy Kotter International's executive director Russell Raath, who has seen businesses trust too much to mere data collection.
”If the company does not take action, employees will begin to wonder whether they heard
and whether their opinions matter.
If the company does not care about them, why should they care about the company?”
Errett, Madison Reed doing now staff surveys on a monthly basis and is able to seize the problem the same day as it is communicated to the Glint.
When Errett had collected feedback from slow decision-making and the quality of the communications frustrated employees, he was able to make changes to the team and organise communication training for problem-solving.
Ruby Tuesday to understand their employees better and I hope that a deeper understanding will help it to improve personnel stability in the long term in the industry, which is known as rapid staff turnover.
”If the company does not undertake to create a transparent culture, it will lose employees,” Vitra said.
”If it loses employees, it loses customers too.
And without customers no business.”

Comic book was born: A castle story
Little Scotney castle Kent county known today as the music of squeeze on the video as well as Margaret thatcher's hiding place in the 1970s and 1980s.
It is, however, behind 700 years of turbulent history. Now this picturesque location bew I was a river valley located in the castle is the subject of a comic book, written by Jamie Rhodes, the old documents fond moppihiuksinen writer.
”I think it's great to get to explore more than 300 years ago the deceased person written by the text,” Rhodes said wistfully.
”I feel a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand.”
The rhodes book, A Castle in England, says scotney in the lives of the families affected stories middle ages to the edwardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, promising a british comic book artist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes the first archive-based book. 2014 him appeared the Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, whose sources of inspiration were the British national library documents. The process was emotional.
”I was moved to tears when I see a letter in the thumbprint. The letter was written by a jacobite to working with a double agent for the 1700-century,” Rhodes told reporters.
”It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell of smoke, because at that time lighting, as was used in the fire.
Three centuries later the scent would make the reader feel that he is himself on the spot.
I love the archives!”
Old documents attracted the writer got to live in the castle for almost four months, the National Trust and English national art council with the support of, what seems too good to be true. He admitted that malta had been promptly in jail a little longer than would have been desired.
He spent days researching victorian ”new” castle, archives, treasures, and rarities, such as on the walls hung a hyena at the ends and for centuries in the moat of the bottles.
He circled the old castle ruins and around the grounds and discuss the forest guards, the gardener and sometimes also books illustrated by artists.
In the evenings, he ”took the whiskey and began to write”.
Scotney the closer the history is quite unknown, as the castle was transferred completely to the National Trust -the foundation until the last heir, Elizabeth Husseyn, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived at the scene about ten years later, the foundation staff was just starting a archives review. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: by taking all the extra in the attic.
Archives were the diaries, the letters of the English empire from the times and maps of who owned what. ”Can you imagine that land disputes are boring,” Rhodes said. ”Here families, however, are fighting even one of the birches.
Came to mind that I think anna would already be.”
Part of the book the story of advancing from the castle the history of England, as The Labourer. It's about a man who will soon be joining the castle after the completion of the English peasant rebellion in 1381.
”The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex -in the book it is mentioned that the castle was a riot of the year 1380”, Rhodes told reporters.
”The English peasant revolt started in the same area, and came to mind that the rebellion can start a riot.
Maybe these events are connected to each other?”
The book's other stories are closely related to the castle's history – such as The Priest, the story of a priest, that darrel's family hid for seven years in the English reformation period.
The Smuggler again told the smuggler Arthur darrell the story of the 1700-century. They say he staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (it was discovered years later, when her tomb was opened).
Darrell, you are a Rhodes favorite family of Scotney. ”The men in the family seem to have been quite the little fellows. They were constantly in debt and buy things which they could not afford it.
Darrell of the family men would solve its debt problem by marrying wealthy old ladies. I see their handsome friends, who were courting heiresses.”
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experience.
He spent two weeks in Finland, authored the cartoon book Elämänmäen, in the early 1900's work of the sanatorium, which is no longer left only the overgrown plot of land.
Scotney castle has a special place in his heart.
”I was sad to leave there,” he says.
”I wouldn't have even come back to this damn everyday life.”

Finnish olympic champion recovering from years of terrible motocross accident - the spine broke
Few sports in Finland is similar to the unstoppable force of nature than Janne Lahtela.
Moguls ace circled the world hundreds of days a year for twenty years and chased his dream of olympic gold.
Dream came true in 2002, but Lahti's business to continue.
He was not only tireless intern, also a new species experiments.
On earth there is probably many exercise, supported by the järvelä-would not at least once tried.
It is enthusiastic to practice.
Always find something new, Lahti says.
Eventually one of the hobby was to stop the Lahti completely.
In 2014, Lahti had a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck rankansa and both hands were broken.
I don't have any work.
Lick the wounds in my home for years, Lahti said.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have been a part in the accident.
Motorcycle driving might sound a bit creepy.
But I applied it to the limits.
It is only as a species so that this sort of forties worth too much to the hobby!
After the accident, Lahti have a peculiar situation.
His busy life stopped like a brick wall.
Behind was a long business of Japanese free style national team as head coach.
Lahti started the job as soon as your career ends up after the year 2006.
For the first time since I was 15 years old, I had to be still.
I don't really do anything, Lahti says.
Coaching in time, Lahti sued several wards, slope, and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so tired, that my ajatuksetkaan didn't seem to make sense.
Not even a couple.
It was good to be in place.
I enjoy it actually, because I really for once just be.
Mandatory break inspired lahtela of Finland's head coach.
Without stopping he afraid of, that it would be burned out.
The body is easier to find places that have gone across it as a whole!
Without the accident I would realize that I needed to rest so much.
Lahti started the Finnish freestyle national team coach about a year ago.
The same time he found the pace of species status for a safer hobby.
I changed the motocrossit frisbee golf!
It's going pretty out of control right now.
At worst, I was seven hours a day throwing.
Although Lahti has always been super eager to work out, he does not require coaching to be just like him.
I don't make all the same mold.
For our species, culture is a space to be its own character and ways to become the world's best.
Freestyle is free of style, and the mentality has always been with it, Lahtela said.
Sex robots are coming, and we have reason to be concerned about
It's here: report on the evolution of technology in the sex robot industry – just when you had begun to feel that in 2017 can't get any weirder.
Yes.
Sex robots are now a big deal.
Responsible robotics foundation (Foundation for Responsible Robotics, FRR) recently released a report on sex robots development in the next 5-10 years.
”We must begin to take seriously the sex robots becoming widespread,” said the foundation's founder and a member of the robotics and artificial intelligence emeritus professor Noel Sharkey of Sheffield university.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and finger nail type.
”Sex robot for snickering, but they are sold already quite a lot, and we will see them more and more,” Sharkey said in a report release conference.
Sex dolls have evolved from a blow vista dolls into robots with the warm feel of the silicone skin and artificial intelligence created features that resemble human behavior.
The user can also customize the robot's own preferences always color of the eyes of the nipple shape and finger nail type and color.
What is even more worrying is that a robot's ”personality”, which makes Stepford wives look like leading as freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved from robots, which have silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix-robot character traits can adapt the user's preferences, say, shy.
True Companion -the company of Roxxxy Gold robots is pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems to be very shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
”Roxxxy gold's personality adapts as perfectly as possible the user's personality”, the company website advertised.
In other words, the robot keeps the same things as the user.
It also has a different mood:
it may be, say, tired, in the mood or ”in the mood”.
Sex robots become more common in a number of worrying features. They replace genuine human relationships, but even more dangerous is women's subjugation and outright rape fantasies, when the user is approaching, for example, being shy and resistance a programmed robot.
True Companion compare website Roxxxy-robot vibraattoriin:
”Women have a vibrator. Why don't men supposed to be a sex robot?”
Sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalisation and the development of tell in some of the darkest and deepest part of our culture: the decline of gender equality towards gender interaction, in which the subjection is one option among others.
The majority of men does not, of course, get a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, although the FRR report says their growing popularity.
Marginal phenomena, however, tell a lot of the time spirit.
And many began to behave strangely or offensively only then, when the market gives you permission to do so.
It is no coincidence that sex robots are beginning to become more common at a time when women's rights are under threat across the world and in the White house sits a president who is bragging ahdistelleensa women.
Television series The Handmaid’s Tale (family members to be able) is not the most worrying of its powerful imagery, for example, images hirtetyistä body and out of the dig of the eye. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the series of the world feel.
Gilead republic is far from reality, but right now there seems to be a surprisingly short trip.
Sex robot from trying to do so much real women like (a porn star proportions) than is technically possible.
Robot developers want that their skin feels real, and the movements mimic as well as possible human movements.
Their ”personalities” are, however, far from reality.
The robot is not able to leave the relationship or situation.
They do not have their own will and no history – nothing independence refers to the or complete subjugation, a fantasy that violates.
They are pleasant to servants.
Orjattaria.
Police suspects: Australia was designed as two terrorist acts, the group leader Isis chief
An extremist faction isis's chief, an australian men's group, which is suspected to have planned the bomb to Etihad Airways on a plane.
Isis was a leading figure of the person was the Sydney Morning Herald according to the sent to Sydney also bomb the building.
Suspected that the bomb was supposed to take the plane 15. July, but the company stopped before the security check.
The police did not tell more detail why the company interrupted.
Another suspected terrorist plan was to build a toxic colorless gas secreting device and take the device crowded public place, for example for public transportation.
The Australian federal assistant commissioner Michael Phelan said that the terrorist plan was one of professional most plans, what Australia has ever done.
Suspected terrorist plans because the four men were captured in a police raid on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but also for his interrogation to continue.
Trump's good side?
Get Mitt Romney to show the common sense of a paragon
Trump's season has already been bandied around ad nauseam, that the electorate strongly divided on an everyday level, has broken up families.
Christmas and thanksgiving around the american newspaper advice columns was guided how to Trump voters with relatives come along.
We all want to pop off the information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to connect with families.
I'll tell you this, because my cousin visiting this week with me in New York. He is a Chicago resident left-wing intellectual poet, who has long been at odds with each other our family with the republicans.
He recalled that the common enemy can be a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White house, my cousin all acquaintances – also republicans should be siblings, with whom he has controversial politics for decades – are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but more broadly, it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new power, but of his presidency distortion effect can in fact take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and the ”normalization”, we talk about it scary possibility, that one day we no longer can continue to be horrified by his tricks.
In the long term is even more dreadful possibility that the Trump normalizes the right of the extreme republicans, who Trump, as compared to seem to suddenly sensible.
I remember wistfully Mitt romney's low-key version of madness: a dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (and his tax returns we have at least seen). Trump compared to they affect the very lieviltä violations.
When Trump's season is over, the republican in the next presidential candidate will only need to be sane, and it seems as soon as a significant improvement from that.
When my cousin was visiting at my house, we took our kids to the central park carousel. It is the New York city parks department's largest carousel and the best of what New York will get three dollars without the caffeine.
The carousel horses are huge, in the middle of the characters – irvokkaat clowns and terror behind to watch the animals – are ominous, and in the background you hear the kilkuttava music is strangely fascinating.
Many New York id circles flatten over time, disappointing: views of the high buildings are boring, the city's silhouette becomes too familiar and the city reality match the dream.
And I still, after 35 years, I have gotten completely over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a swiss cottage, but a large traffic circle in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage though is a swiss intellectual pub, but it doesn't count.
The central park carousel instead, it is still a strange magical experience – even to the extent that the two two-year-old, one eleven year old and two nelikymppistä women enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a perfect score, if someone had asked for my evaluation, but fortunately, no one came asking questions.
Instead, I was asked this week goods in the house to assess the ”payment experience” on a scale of one to five stars, before I put my credit card number to the device.
The same thing in a cafe in my neighbourhood, but there to me is given also the possibility of combining assessment of 15% of the service money, when I'll get the coffee on the counter.
This slows down the everyday interaction and pressure the customer service agents to put their personalities into the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The department store saleswoman smiled regret the circumstances, when I gave wearily my credit card the user experience to five stars.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate might sound like a digestive system nightmare night.
A recent study argues the opposite, however: an abundance of meat protein and dairy products containing diet may help to ease the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease, which affects about 1.3 million people in the united states and 300 000 people in the Uk. It causes abdominal cramps, bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Irritable bowel syndrome sufferers are advised to generally avoid meat and dairy products. Washington university researchers, however, found that a protein contains the essential amino acid tryptophan helps the body to develop immune cells, which strengthen the bowel resilience.
The study director Marco Colonna, according to immune cells guarding the swamp and make sure that the food in hiding the harmful microbes from the body.
Inflammation-causing cells to balance the cells, that strengthen resilience. They protect the body from damaging the sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, the result can be irritable bowel syndrome.
In experiments it was found that tolerance to reinforcing the immune cells in mice that the intestine is a certain bacteria.
The bacteria needs tryptophan, to make immune cells began to emerge. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
”We found common Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and resilience-promoting cells development. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal intestinal microbes of their own,” professor Colonna told reporters.
”What's more mice in the diet was tryptophan, the more they were such in the immune cells.”
If the same works in humans, Lactobacillus reuteri -bacterial and rich in tryptophan contained in the diet combination can strengthen the intestinal resilience and reduce the inflammation sensitivity.
When examining resilience reinforcing the immune cell researcher dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that even a single mouse group had such cells, they did not have the same mouse species of mice, which were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference between joined mouse intestinal mikrobio us, i.e. the gastrointestinal tract of normal bacteria, fungi and viruses in the community.
When the mouse intestinal DNA were studied, was found in six bacterial species, which were those mice with immune cells, but not in other mice.
When the Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were given in a sterile environment growth in those mice, which did not have the intestinal microbes of their own and who did not develop immune cells, they began to emerge in the immune cells.
The researchers wanted to figure out how the bacteria affect the immune system. They increased the Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the liquid and passing the small amount of fluid without bacteria – mouse insulated epäkypsiin immune cells.
Immune cells developed resilience strengthening into cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be tryptophan metabolism side product, which is known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers double the tryptophan of the number of mice in nutrition, resilience to confirm the number of cells increased to about 50%. When tryptophan quantity was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous.
Cervantes-a god on earth according to people have the same resilience of the reinforcing cells than mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri to bacteria in the digestive channels.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria cells to develop in humans in the same way as the mouse. Irritable bowel syndrome is, however, observed tryptofaaniin related genetic errors.
”We want to probably promote such cell development, because they regulate the intestines to the inner surface of the inflammation”, Cervantes-Barragan said.
”High tryptophan levels, combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their popularization.”
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got their ranks ”genius” to make the contract of Nemanja Matic with
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got their ranks ”genius” to make the contract of Nemanja Matic. Midfielder made his debut in Manchester united's ranks in the match Sampdoriaa against on Wednesday night.
Chelsea for 40 million pounds have shifted Matic started the 2-1 win in Dublin, united's last season pre-match before the UEFA Super Cup -tournament-match at Real Madrid on Tuesday. He made an impact as the defensive midfield player Paul Pogban and Andreas Pereira-like stars.
Matic, however, was not yet in the best condition, because he was not involved in the blue shirt of the Asian tour before the start of the season. He did on the pitch only 45 minutes – it is Mourinho must be a change before the premiership season begins.
”He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and way of thinking make him a genius – he has a natural football thinking ability,” Mourinho said.
”We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later.”
Matic, but also the newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were about to start the game from the Aviva stadium, when Mourinho began to tweak the starting lineup at the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three new players, although the club has already done a ”fantastic job” by purchasing three of his four priority information with the player.
”Three out of four – about the need to give a follow to thank you,” he added.

The white house exhibits cost thousands of dollars to the taxpayer
The white house last month was not the decision to fly the naval helicopter on the White house south lawn for the american production of the pcc to the event cost taxpayers $ 24,000. Information occurs in TIME magazine of military documents.
Green white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is known as Marine One when the president is riding in it. It was the main attraction of the White house 17.7.2017 at the event, which was presented to the american building programme.
President Donald Trump, vice president Mike Pence and a group of White house officials acquainted with the products of all the 50 states.
Connecticut manufactured the helicopter in addition to the exhibit was, inter alia, sail a boat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and forklift Mississippi.
The white house military office had asked the helicopter to the scene task-specific prescription only about 36 hours before its landing on the south lawn for ”exceptional” event. This is evident from the marine HMX-1-the helicopter squadron of the documents.
”I just wanted to make sure that you are aware of the issue, because it is an exceptional event, which gets a lot of visibility”, the HMX-1 unit commander wrote of events the day before in the email to his supervisor, who is a naval aviation deputy commandant.
The message was informed that the helicopter would arrive on the south lawn 17.7. at seven in the morning and the event would start at three in the afternoon. The helicopter would remove the place after the grass field to be drained in the evening from between six and nine.
In addition, in the message it was mentioned that if the helicopter departure from the White house to delay, the place would have to be another crew service times due to restrictions.
The original crew had the helicopter in the event period, and unit security personnel was the helicopter, when it was in the country.
TIME magazine obtained the documents is not clear, you did eventually another crew.
The united states Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents HMX-1 inquired as to a breach occurring in the law.
”One of our questions was whether the this Hatch Act. We were told that not broken,” the commander wrote.
”It sounds like you can participate in”, the deputy commandant replied.
Made in America was the White house official event, so it didn't belong Hatch Act scope of the law.
But the official caps events have a political tone.
At the event the president spoke at that time, the senate hearing was the health care reform, and a looser state regulation.
Marine One -the helicopter and Air Force One -the aircraft usage for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents have used their travels,
but their use only for photos is unusual.
Trump's action aroused the attention in February, when Air Force One taxied to a presidential campaign event in the background of Melbourne in the state of Florida. Trump has strongly criticised his predecessor a presidential aircraft for use on Twitter.
”The white house is very pleased with the Made in America event, which was presented to the american workers of american materials manufacturers products from all 50 states,” said White house press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 unit crews conduct regular training flights in the Washington area and practice on the south lawn, the president brought to the White house centimeters of accuracy.
When Trump was the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 do 58 exercise landing on the White house.
A clerk, according to the flights Made in America event belonged to the crew of the monthly training quota.
Unit helicopters were flying that day, including 11 hours of ”non-presidential in a supporting role”.
The white house said the incident did not cause the taxpayer of other expenses.
Sikorsky spokesman told reporters that the company was not involved in organizing helicopter demonstration on the White house south lawn.
HMX-1 has no accounting of the president's tasks related to flights and event costs, accurate assessment is difficult.
The ministry of defence in 2017 hours compensation according to the VH-3D helicopter, the compensation level is 24 380 dollars a flight hour.
HMX-1 unit, according to the documents flights to Quantico base, Virginia from the White house and back lasting a total of an hour.
The white house, according to the helicopter's operating costs are clearly lower.
”The taxpayer costs of calculation of the compensation according to the level of it is misleading”, Walters said.
”The estimated compensation level includes personnel, maintenance and many other so-called embedded cost, which is taken into account in the annual appropriation.”
RAND-research company in 2015, a survey conducted according to the compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but they take into account fuel, maintenance and contractual cost.
The event at the time former White house press secretary Sean Spicer defended the helicopter use at the event.
”The idea is to introduce american production,” Spicer said.
”I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are involved in ensuring national security and employ it through probably hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think most american way we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment, which many americans have worked hard.
It is perfectly appropriate to bring up.”
Not sure, did Trump in the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat down on a fire truck in the driver's seat.
The white house Trump joked to the press of his own Sikorsky-laivueestaan.
”I know sikorsky's very well,” the president said. ”I got three of them.”

Certain types of tourists flood threat to the region's culture
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage against, in particular cruise ships represent the tourist form.
Italy's culture minister calls it the "eat and flee" -tourism: in just a few hours and go right to the big number of attractions through.
Venice is suffocating in a quick day trip from the city to the tourists.
The narrow streets are difficult to move and fine squares are so full of visitors that Venice residents can hold no longer among them.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historical centre, at the same time, when the home of the farm has become a hotel.
Tourist problems in Venice wrote to The New York Times and The Guardian.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist flow.
They call the current phenomenon of poor quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on large cruise ships, time is given for two or three hours.
You follow the flag to the guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto bridge and st. Mark's square, and you turn back, describes the Italian culture minister Dario Franceschini prevailing and troubling tourists.
The Italian city of beauty is not only in architecture, but also a place, the shops and workshops in operation.
We must maintain this part of the urban identity.
St. Mark's square, also includes the Venice historic centre's most popular attractions.
Square is located st. Mark's church.
Also local anger is focused mainly on the cruise ships.
Venice's historic centre, living longer 50 000 local.
In 1951, the inhabitants was about 175 000.
In July, an estimated 2 000 venetian was protesting in mass tourism.
According to them, the tourist has impaired their quality of life, destroy the environment and drive the inhabitants away.
About 2 000 residents leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years in Venice not as tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, said the demonstration järjestmässä Carlo Belframe.
The equation is difficult, as the ships bring to Venice the much-needed income and create the need for numerous job sectors.
Tourist amount in addition to limiting the solution it is envisaged that the cruiser would go farther away from the historic centre.
Venice resident Luciano Borton's view, the situation would change for sure if the Veneto administrative region, which Venetsiakin is located, you get more power to decide their own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Venice is visited every year about 20-30 million tourists.

Foot injury took snowboarder Janne korpi's entire career on the line - now featuring world cup: "Nice when you don't hurt anywhere"
Now it has been a nice decline, when there hasn't been any!
Finland's most successful snowboard visitors, as Janne Korpi, 31, is in this season again really enjoy my beloved species.
Yet last summer, the career of a graduate was at stake.
Metatarsal stress fracture had forced the Wilderness on the operating table in January, and the legs didn't want any heal.
A hand had taken a hit on the race slope.
In the summer I had no idea what to do, whether to continue surfing or not.
The sponsorship deal was rehab and a lot of things open, Woods told reporters.
But you know what they say, that things work out.
The foot healed, the sponsor to extend the contract by two years, and the blood begins again to pull the slopes.
Further, the decision was easy.
I know its the latest when I went for the first time on the snow.
I was like, damn, yes this again is so much fun, we'll pull a couple through.
Backwoods get to count properly until September-October, but the long billing after a mere painless to work out is a big deal.
Races Korpi has toured only a few.
It doesn't matter.
The competition hasn't been wilderness for ever boarding the most important aspect.
I've never one a race due to decreased.
I think it is frustrating to aim four years coincide with the races, and then you are a fever that week.
I don't think so, Korpi said.
Today Wilderness race in the Spanish Sierra Nevada held the world cup halfpipessa.
Even if the individual games do not like him either snowboarding, hard to follow in the race for he lights up always.
The wilderness, according to the International ski federation organised by the race of the valuation has in recent years grown, although some of the surfers to choose from too at the same time to be held in norway's X-Games.
Yes, these are important games, visibility is big.
Though I think the valuation always depends on what circumstances and what level the race is.
Wilderness is the Sierra Nevada, Finland 12-mental the team's oldest athlete.
The team kuopukset, 17-year-old Rene slope fabric and Emmeline parkkinen cape, are of Nowhere 14 years younger.
It's nice to follow the younger guys the way.
I remember when I myself was at that stage that all was new and was so freakin ' excited about everything.
It brings self too a new power, Backwoods thinking.
The slope still somehow behind, but otherwise, I don't, that much is a guy in power!
Skateboarding-career background Janne Korpi is built also another kind of sports career.
Control coach legend Pekka korpi's son is an improved horse racing: lautailijalla is to own a racehorse, which he makes the workout programs.
When I'm all the time on a trip, so I got it more to be in the mess hall.
But look at every day at least, racing results and usually something lähtöjäkin, Korpi says.
Raviohjastaja and ravivalmennus are the Wilderness according to a potential career, when snowboarding career will come to a conclusion.
I don't want to plan so far, but it is the least likely option.
Experience it so that a little bit as I studied it this snowboard along with.
Trying to keep up with the times and evolve, in the summer run, maybe something lähtöjäkin.
If it is my future profession, so it is not then difficult to start, when it is already inside the sport.
Ravijuttuja I also heard the presenter Drove Linnonmaa with organised Elitloppet-raviristeily.
The duo has rented a cruise ship, which direction at the end of may in stockholm for the Elitloppet-harness racing.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to wake the old tradition back to life.
Cruise has gone on to sell well, and people have been excited.
Now we're already to that point, that at least does not become bankrupt.
A few months is still time, let's hope that there will be a ship full, Korpi said excitedly.
