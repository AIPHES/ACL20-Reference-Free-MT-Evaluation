Ethics Guards: Liberal Movement Board on the Law of Vilnius Department
"The decisions taken by the Board are in accordance with the Articles of Association", - after the meeting of the Commission, the head of the BNS was informed by its head Vytautas Tamošiūnas.
"Our solution was not new.
We had already made the interpretation as a commission in July, when the question of Pagėgiai and Utena came up.
Then we said that, under the statutes, this is a matter of board competence.
And if the board decides that some department can behave as they want it to - go with the committee and the board approves it, then the department can go, but if the board decides that everywhere there will be party lists, what the board has adopted, then there is a decision that all sections would form party lists.
And if there is no agreement with the board, then there is a chance to suspend membership and go with the committee, "he added.
According to V. Tamošiūnas, the party board will now decide on further action.
On October 17, the Liberal Movement Board of the Party abolished the decision of the Vilnius City Division to participate in the municipal election committee with a new sailing committee.
According to the party board, the decision of the capital's liberals to take part in the election in the form of a public electoral committee violated the statutes of the party and the decisions of the board.

The inhabitants of a rural village in northern India ran a tiger with a tractor that had previously torn one man, officials said on Monday.
Mahavir Kaudzlag, a Forestry Officer, said that tigers late Sunday tore a man working in the fields, and the villagers surrounded the beast and ran it with a tractor while trying to escape.
Residents say that this tiger also attacked one young man about 10 days ago.
The village is located in the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Lakhympur Kheri, about 250 km southeast of Uttar Pradesh, the capital city of Lucknow.
It is forbidden to catch tigers in protected areas.
Ramesh Pandey, Director of the Reserve, said Ramsha Pandey said the police would be notified of the case under the Wildlife Conservation Act.
In April, the villagers beat another tiger in the Uighur district of Uttar Pradesh; it suffered serious injuries.
Tiger is an Indian national animal; According to the Wildlife Conservation Act, tigers are considered endangered species.
Last year's government figures show that at least one person has been killed daily in the past three years with wild tigers or elephants.
Human tensions with tigers have been gradually increasing since the 1980s, when India launched a tiger protection program, which established national reserves in national parks, and began to criminalize big cats.
Although tiger counting methods have changed, censuses would show that the population of about 1,800 tigers then grew to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
It is proposed that cats and dogs be labeled with microchips
Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Environment Protection Committee, together with other members of the Seimas, registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, which propose to mark cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips.
"We suggest that cats and dogs should be labeled with subcutaneous microchips, and their registration and labeling should be organized by local authorities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be labeled free of charge from public funds, and in 2020, cats will be free of charge, so the public will not be worried and the costs will be covered by specially planned state funding, "said Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Environment Committee of the Seimas.
Amendments to the law aim to address the systematic need for the labeling of domestic animals.
This is expected to prevent problems caused by irresponsible breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is estimated, on a provisional basis, that the average cost of the chip and the service, which will amount to around € 5, will be compensated for by all animal owners during the transitional period.
The total cost of marking all pets can reach up to 6 million. EUR.
The demand for these funds is expected to spread over three years and will amount to 2 million annually. EUR.
It is anticipated that funding for labeling programs will be channeled through the Municipal Environmental Support Special Program, whose income will increase significantly this year as a result of increased natural resource taxes and redistribution of funds.
These funds will be used by municipalities not only for the labeling of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programs.
According to K. Mažeika, the practice of mandatory labeling is common in almost all countries of the European Union, which also allows the animals themselves to be protected (because they can easily be returned to the owners), and saves the time of the animal producers themselves, when searching for a sheltered and misguided pet requires a lot of time and money.
In addition, EU legislation stipulates that only pets are allowed to travel.
At the same time, labeling obliges the animal to take care of his life responsibly.
Earlier suggestions for mandatory labeling were opposed because the relevant programs were proposed to be funded by the population.
"The current model should avoid this criticism, as animal protection is proposed to be funded by increased income in the environmental support program and the right to label not only veterinarians but also public figures, ie people in animal care institutions, who have heard special courses at the Veterinary Academy," the authors of the project .
The draft law was registered by a group of Seimas members representing different factions of the Seimas - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

In this film, Brigita plays the wife of Dainius Kazlauskas' hero.
"I really liked filming" Liars "because I'm more of a theater actress and rarely appear in cinema.
The amazing team of colleagues gathered from the beginning promised a great result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the pitch was the puppy Sunny!
Throughout my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would be great and serious.
I never admired those little, ornamental fifa quads.
But during the filming, Sunny was so attached to me that sympathy became reciprocal, and eventually I wanted to buy it from the hostess, but it failed ", - smiles the actress.

Will Decide to Write 100 Million unpaid taxes on emigrants
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted a revision of the Law on the Declaration of Place of Residence prepared by Ramūnas Karbauskis, the leader of the peasants.
56 members of the Seimas voted in favor, 9 against, and 25 abstentions.
The Seimas will then proceed to a review of the amendments on December 6 or later, following the Government's conclusion.
According to R. Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarian, one person does not pay about 1 thousand in three years. € 100,000 now.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sys regretted that, in this way, the Seimas would "urge some people not to comply with their obligations" - to declare their departure and then no taxes would be charged.
Antanas Matulas, a member of the Health Affairs Committee, noted that Lithuanians living abroad use the fact that when paying a small health insurance fee, they come to Lithuania for treatment - they are provided with the same services as those who pay the tax.
The amendments provide that those who will pay social insurance contributions in the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation will be considered as leaving Lithuania, and that Sodra will be exempt from payment of health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
The head of "Sodra" Mindaugas Sinkevičius has previously said that such a step will make life easier for both emigrants and Sodra.
An online video of a sliding teddy bear reveals a serious problem
Nailed out as the mother's bear climbs up a steep snowy slope, and the little one climbs up, slips down and stubbornly sticks back.
The video has received many views and comments.
People were fascinated by the insistence of the little bear - he slipped down again several times, and he crawled back to his mother.
He does not succeed the first time, but the little one does not try to give up and finally reaches his goal.
The video is really a matter of attention, but it also reveals the threat posed by humans to animals.
Scientists argue that it is necessary to talk about the fact that people's desire to know wildlife can sometimes be harmful.
"It is obvious to me that the drone of the bears was very scared.
Their movements show that they panic.
If there were no drone around, they would probably have chosen a safer way or slower or cautiously overcome it.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used, "said Ecologist Mark Dmitmer for The Verge.
Some time ago, Mr Dmitmer and his colleagues explored how drones work with bears.
Animals were fitted with heart rate monitors.
When the drone approached, some bears started running, others didn't run away, but all their hearts began to whip up fright.
Scientists advise drones to be used responsibly for animals, do not fly too close, do not make noise and do not fly where it is forbidden.
He approached the escaped president through a newspaper
The court in Kiev on Tuesday summoned a depressed President Viktor Yanukovych to come to Russia for an extraordinary rendezvous in the case of his alleged state of extradition - published in the official gazette of the state.
In a court summons published in the government news magazine "Uriadovoj kurjer", the former leader is invited to attend a criminal hearing on November 19, during which his closing arguments could be heard.
The document states that Yanukovych has the right to participate in a video call.
On October 30, the Kyiv court announced the end of the debate in the Yanukovych case.
Aleksandras Gorošinskis, a Russian lawyer working for Russia, was given the opportunity to register with the Foreigners' Lawyers by November 19 so that he could attend a meeting where Mr Yanukovich is expected to speak with his last word.
The Kremlin-sponsored Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidian uprising in February 2014, provoked by the president's refusal to sign an association with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that a former Ukrainian leader had been taken to Russia through a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, and a little later in the east, a war between separatists supported by Kiev and Russia.
Since then, the struggle has killed about 10,000. despite the many attempts by the international community to secure a long-term ceasefire.

Constraints of cogeneration power plants are appealed to the Constitutional Court
The Seimas opposition, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (CC) against the decision of the rulers to pass a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the Seimas Opposition Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) faction announced that a group of Seimas members had appealed to the CC asking them to investigate the compliance of the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by the ruling.
"The parliamentarians emphasize that the provisions of the law are aimed at questioning the already existing projects of waste incineration plants, instructing the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km distance from the residential area) before the entry into force of the law for the construction of waste incineration plants in Vilnius and Kaunas," the report said.
"The parliamentarians point out that, as the law prohibits the construction of sites of national importance for the management of waste (ie the definition of distance and the definition of" living area "), it follows that this prohibition is disproportionately restricting or even denying the right to pursue an economic activity, \ t As regards the incineration of energy for the production of waste, the essence is that the established criteria are formulated in such a way that, after assessing the density and distribution of the Lithuanian population in the country, it would be practically impossible to construct such objects in the whole territory of the country ", - adds.
The petition states that the adopted law contradicts the constitutional principle of a state under the rule of law.
"The CC has repeatedly pointed out that the law does not apply to the legal facts and consequences that occurred before the new legislation came into force.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law back on the basis of an indefinite criterion.
Having established such legal regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security, protection of legitimate expectations, and thus the constitutional principle of a state under the rule of law ", - indicates the applicant.
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the projects of cogeneration plants in Vilnius and Kaunas.
If the current projects are stopped, the state would suffer not only hundred hundred million financial losses, huge losses incurred by the Lithuanian population - increase of heating prices, because of the increasing amount of waste disposal in landfills would increase environmental pollution.
The appeal to the CC was signed by members of the Seimas TS-LKD, Liberal Movement, Social Democratic factions and ruling deputy of the Social Democratic Working Group Algirdas Butkevičius.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to vote for 71 votes to reject President Dalia Grybauskaitė's veto on amendments to the Waste Management Act, which provided for the right of the Government to stop the already started construction of cogeneration power plants, and also set a 20-kilometer "quarantine" area for the construction of such power plants.
The Seimas Re-Adopted Law Amendments will come into force from 2019. January 1 True, the rulers are already proposing to abandon the 20 km limit.
This proposal is planned to be discussed at the Seimas autumn session.
However, the government's right to stop projects that have already begun is not planned.
The CC will deal with the case in a sequence - not earlier than a year.
He published the questioning LeBron James statistics in the Lakers club
The start of LeBron's James career at the Losers Club in Los Angeles is not what he expected, the organization and the basketball fans.
The Lakers started the season with four wins and six defeats, and this weak start helped to make rumors about the possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
Still, such speeches were reassured by basketball operations president Magic Johnson, who said the coach wouldn't let go, but the play was better.
The biggest team star, James James, should look back at himself.
Although striking statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 scores.
But it does not tell the whole truth.
In the first ten seasons of the match, there were other figures showing that Lakers was playing better when there was no L. James on the pitch.
The attacker has a negative +/- statistic showing how many points are scored or missed when there are certain players on the pitch.
That's when James is on the pitch, Lakers spent 30 points more than his rivals in this season.
As he sat on the bench, "Eagles" earned 19 points more than the rivals.
At the moment, Lakers is in the West Conference in just 13th place, but several victories can turn everything upside down.

V. Ačienė about the arrest of R. Ace: I believe in man's innocence and law enforcement
"For me it was the most unexpected thing I could never think of.

I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is right and fair, that no dishonest actions should be taken, "Achiene told BNS.
Ace was detained by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday - the law enforcement suspects that he was still a high-value bribe while he was the director of Raseiniai Municipality Administration, and in exchange could create exclusive conditions for a private company signing a contract with a municipal-owned Raseiniai bus fleet.

"I do not make sudden decisions today, I think this week, I decide.
I will see if there is a need, what accusations are made, of course, I will make one or another decision.
Perhaps it is necessary to stay away from all the things that are being investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again, all the time is in their places, "she said.
Representative of Conservative Conservatives in the Seimas Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė urged the Speaker of the Seimas Viktor Pranckietis and the head of the "peasants" Ramūnas Karbauskis to disassociate from the statements of the colleague of the faction Vida Ačienė and to recall it from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission by transferring to another Seimas committee or commission.
She argues that further work by V. Ačienė at the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission "would lead to public-based mistrust and discredit the work of an important parliamentary oversight commission".

The cause of the Lion Air crash was revealed: the relatives of the dead were angry
The collapse of the black box in the Lion Air, a Indonesian airline, has shown that at least four of its last flights have experienced a malfunction of the speedometer, researchers said on Monday.
Soerjan Tjahjon, chairman of the National Transport Security Committee (NSCC), said that a similar foul occurred during the last four flights of the plane, including the fate, when on 29 October the liner fell in the sea of Java immediately after rising from Jakarta.
All 189 people on the plane were killed during this catastrophe.
Many media reports reported a problem with the previous Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, in fact, the technical problem was speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the airplane," Tjahjon said at a press conference.
"The black box data showed that Denpasar-Jakarta was the same problem in two flights before the flight," he added.
"There are a lot of rumors about social networks.
Now we want to clarify that in the black box (data remains) about four flights that had problems with the air speed meter, "said the head of the NTSC.
During a meeting with the members of the deceased families, Tjahjon said that the flight data recorder information was consistent with reports that the speed and altitude of the last flight fluctuated disorderly.
Search teams have not yet found a second black box that records conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air indicated that it had been repaired in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations when a technical malfunction was detected during a flight from Bali to Jakarta.
One of the company's founding fathers, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to Minister of Transport Budi Karya Sumadi, a moderator of a family meeting with officials overseeing the search for plane and victim remains and disaster investigation.
But he stood up and tipped his head when the angry and distressed family members demanded that Kirana, along with his brother Kusan, set up Lion Air in 1999.
"The Lion Air behaved wrongly," said one man who introduced himself as the passenger of Shandy Johan Ramadhan, a prosecutor on the island to which the plane flew.
"I want Mr Rusana Kirana and his team to pay attention," he stressed.
- Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air didn't show us any compassion.
Following this meeting, Kirana left hastily, avoiding journalists' questions.
Many families are looking forward to the results of a long process of recognizing the dead.
Almost 140 corpse bags loaded with parts of human remains were handed over to police medical experts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
The relatives questioned why the launch of the liner two months ago was allowed to fly, although a breakdown occurred on 28 October from Bali to Jakarta, inter alia, leading to a sudden downhill flight of the airplane after the flight.
Lion Air said this failure was removed.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? - asked the son of one of the dead.
- If not, the relevant technicians must be held liable.
The law is very clear, they did not claim that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians are required by law to stop airplane crashes in Indonesia.
Tjahjon said that the large amount of fine debris and the fact that the wreck spread in a rather small area indicates that the liner was likely to run at very high speeds in the water.
"The plane was solid when it fell to the sea.
It does not explode in the air, and the airplane engines, when they touched the water, operated at high speeds - as shown by all the broken turbine blades, "the official said.
The Lion Air shipwreck is the largest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died as a result of the collapse of Garuda aircraft near Medan.
After the accident, the wreckers were led by the rescuers: the minor also suffered
On Monday evening, on the road Vėžaičiai - Plungė, cars "BMW" and "Mercedes-Benz" were hit by Tilvikai.
Cars are hit by cactus, three people are reported to be affected.
It is reported that a BMW driver, born in 1999, left for the opposite side of the road, and the Kaktomusha drove to Mercedes-Benz, a father, born in 1967, and a daughter born in 2005.
The BMW driver was saved by wreckers - rescuers.
The girl from the Mercedes-Benz crashed the teeth during the accident.
All the victims were taken to hospital.
Presidency: no artificial facilitations for a referendum
After the Seimas has approved the proposal of the ruling to reduce the referendum cartel to the first section of the Constitution, which has a higher level of protection, the President will propose amendments, says her adviser Mindaugas Lingė.
"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - this is a requirement.
This and its change, especially the articles in its first section, should certainly be no less than a majority.
It is easy to predict that the president is really vetoed, "Dalia Grybauskaitė's adviser to internal politics told Tuesday.
He emphasized that the first chapter of the Constitution defines the fundamental subjects of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, sovereignty of the state, therefore, by reducing the number of votes necessary to replace these articles, according to M. Linge, a "negative precedent" and "uncontrolled risk" would be created.
"According to the President, there is no need for any artificial relief, more preparation for the referendum, more dialogue with the people," he assured.
On Tuesday, the Seimas plans to vote on the adoption of the amendment to the Law on Referendum.
It provides that amendments to the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution with a higher level of protection shall be adopted if at least two-fifths of the electorate has the right to vote in a referendum.
At present, more than half of all citizens with the right to vote may replace the articles of the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution by referendum.
Election rights in Lithuania are about 2.5 million. citizens: half would be 1.25 million voters, two-fifths - one million voters.
This proposal was born after the Seimas adopted in September a presidential veto on earlier amendments to the Parliament, which eased the requirements for the number of votes by changing Article 12 of Section 1 of the Constitution, which defines citizenship.
It is proposed to reduce the cartel to a referendum in preparation for the referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first and second rounds of presidential elections are planned.
Since the restoration of independence on March 11, 1990, emigrants, apart from some exceptions, cannot have dual citizenship.
The dual Lithuanian citizenship is sought by the Lithuanian community but fears that in the current circumstances a referendum would not take place - a sufficient number of people would not vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian Airports "dirty", so they need to be upgraded
The Lithuanian airport and road infrastructure is beginning to grow, so it needs to be renewed, says Minister of Transport and Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renovation of Vilnius airport is a minimum task that the state must perform.
"Air transport infrastructure is already dear as it was designed for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew the Vilnius airport - it does not even go into long-term planning, it is the minimum we must do ", said Masiulis at a communication conference organized by the Democracy Development Fund and the State magazine.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, as important projects will have to be implemented - Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, Klaipeda's external port will be built, Vilnius and Kaunas airports will be renovated, and perhaps a new airport will be built.
"The next decade will be very important - we need to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of an external port in Klaipėda, to arrange airports, perhaps to decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, already start projects that will exploit our potential after 10, 20 or 30 years, "said the Minister of Transport and Communications.
Mr Masiulis reiterated that in recent years there has been too little funding for car maintenance.
"The road condition is not improving yet, because the funds are not allocated enough.
We are able to build new roads, but even the most necessary maintenance, for example on highways, is lacking funds.
We must determine the amount that should be spent on road maintenance if we want to improve their condition, "said Masiulis.
He emphasized that exports of services in the Lithuanian transport sector grew by 18.6% this year, and Germany, the largest export market, outperformed Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticized the European Commission's proposal that EU carriers will be required to return trains periodically to the country of registration.
"We must strive to make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the suggestion of tow trucks returning home is absurd, as empty trucks in Europe burn fuel and increase emissions.
Most of this will be won by the railways, because the cost will increase to a fraction of the transport to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions, "said Masiulis.
According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, 12.2% is created in the transport sector.
Lithuanian gross domestic product (GDP).
It employs more than 118,000 employees and employs more than 7,500 companies.
Disputes with Heritageists
Last week p. Masiulis announced in the Seimas Economic Committee that he had begun negotiations on changing the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building, which would allow the old terminal to be demolished and a new one to be built.
However, Algimantas Degutis Interim Manager of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) p. Masioul called his political pressure.
According to him, the building, built in the sixties of the last century, is a value entered in the register in 1993, and not politicians, but specialists have to decide on its deletion.
Mr Masiulis then commented that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving Lithuania's image.
"The legacy of pulling out that old terminal would be a politically important step to demolish it and build a new modern arrival terminal so that when you arrive in Vilnius you feel in a modern country and not as interesting, truly unrepresentative of our country as innovative," he said last week in the Seimas. p. Masiulis.
Mr. Masiulis also announced that it is planned to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and to connect the airport to the Rail Baltica track by building an underground station.
This hub should operate in 2026 after completion of Rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius Airport serviced about 3.7 million passengers. people are expected to spend 4.8 million this year next year - 5 million passengers
Last year Kaunas Airport handled 1.2 mln. passengers.

"We must always prepare for heavier times.
What I want to celebrate is that for the third year in a row, for the first time in Lithuania's history, we have accumulated reserves.

Traditions and customs of Lithuanian work
Recently 120 years have passed since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural writer, ethnographer and ethnographer Balys Buračs (1897-1972) in Sidari, Šiaulėnai County, then Šiauliai Governorate.
In commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian state, we have a great opportunity to remember how the life-reviving national rebirth called many of the people of Lithuania, including the brothers Buračus - Bali, Jonas, Bronys - from the very depths of the countryside we can get involved in the cherishing, conceiving and preservation of our cultural traditions. .
For more than 50 years, Balys Buračas has traveled his home country with a camera in his hands, giving a broad and realistic picture of our country's customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing layers of national culture and had a rare ability to perceive the enduring value of his work.
In the photographs of Balys Buračas, the landscape, mounds, everyday life and holidays of our people were decorated with folk costumes by Lithuanian folk costumes.
This publication contains a considerable part of Balys Buračas' legacy dedicated to the description of national work habits and related traditions and, above all, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the uniqueness and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the last century, despite two world wars and a heavy occupation.
In the manuscript of the book, the works of the interwar Samogitia, especially those of the Kupiai, Šiauliai, Telsiai, as well as the inhabitants of Aukštaitija and Dzūkija, their festivities and other traditions and customs written by Balys Buračs are abundant.
Out of the approximately 10,000 negatives preserved in museums and archives, over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photos have been selected for this publication, grouped by selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture that are typical of couples, Dzukis, other regions of Aukštaitija and Samogitia.

The tragic fate of the couple: just a few hours after the marriage
In the US Southwest of Texas, just a couple of hours ago, a couple of married couples were killed during a helicopter catastrophe.
24-year-old William Troy Byler and his companion wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler were killed on Sunday after a midnight helicopter climbing a hill 16 km northwest of Jewelery and 129 km west of San Antonio, said local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
It is strange that the disaster occurred some 24 kilometers as long as the newlyweds were years old.
The 76-year-old Gerald Douglas Lawrence, a helicopter pilot, also died.
Newlyweds studied at Sam's Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.
They married on Saturday evening at the Byler Family Ranch near Juvaldis and went on a family-owned helicopter after a wedding celebration.
The accident occurred after the helicopter flew about 24 kilometers.
The newlyweds flew to Sant Antoni International Airport, where they were going to board the plane and fly on a honeymoon, said Kennedy, without specifying the final destination of the trip.
"It's a very rocky, uneven terrain, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high," said Kennedy.
Mr Lawrence has been piloting the aircraft of that family for many years.
According to Kennedy, he piloted helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After the autopsy it should be clear what the pilot's physical condition was and could not be the cause of the catastrophe.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after the takeoff.
His wreckage crawled wide on a rocky hillside, and the hull remained "dangerously hungry", a Craig Hatch from the National Transport Security Board (NTSB) said at a press conference on Monday.
The researchers are going to take the debris out and then thoroughly inspect them, but it will not be easy for the truck and truck to reach that place, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been identified and the preliminary NTSB report should be published two weeks later.
Israeli prime minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions against Iran "historic day"
"Today is a historic day," Netanyahu said to members of his party "Likud", his office said.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of Donald Tramp, the US is imposing particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions against Iran throughout the period of attempts to curb his aggression," said the head of the Israeli government.
Earlier on Monday, the Israeli Defense Minister, Avigdor Lyberman, said the new sanctions would be a "decisive" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures that Washington calls "the most severe sanctions of all time" have been introduced after the decision of May Trump and the controversial decision to withdraw from the global power deal with Tehran for his nuclear program.
Sanctions are aimed at significantly reducing Iran's oil exports, which have already plunged around a million barrels a day since May, and cut off Tehran's international funding.
Israel has long opposed the above-mentioned agreement with Iran and says its scope and deadlines are too limited.
The Jewish state also says that the lifting of sanctions has allowed Iran to finance militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighboring Syria and has promised not to allow him to settle there in military terms.
The other participants in the agreement with Iran - Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - do not agree with the US decision and say that the agreement, as it was planned, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court is reappearing the circumstances of the death of the young rider
The death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, a northern town, in a crash case, will hear the witness's testimony.
The Vilnius Regional Court ruled on Tuesday that one of the witnesses will be heard at the next meeting on 26 November in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case.
In this case, an acquittal has already been declared, but the prosecutor's office does not agree with it.
On August 22, the Vilnius City District Court acquitted the driver of the car, declaring that 79-year-old rider was driving in the city at high speed and committing a gross violation, due to a fatal motorcycle accident.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office asks the District Court to annul the District Court's judgment and claims that the biggest fault lies with E. Osipov, and the findings of the District Court are unfounded.
The annulment of the acquittal is also requested by the deceased motorcyclist's family lawyer.
The accident took place on August 11, 2015, at about 15:00, when the car "Škoda Fabia" driven by E. Osipov from Lakūnų Street entered Žirmūnų Street and encountered a motorcycle on the main road.
The prosecutor's office accused the man that the driver of the car violated the Road Traffic Rules, which caused the road, and caused a road accident - a man killed on a main road motorcycle Piaggo.
Initial police reports indicated that the scooter driver was killed, but later on, the vehicle was considered to be a motorcycle in terms of power.
Rolandas Bužinskas, a judge of the Vilnius City District Court, said the BNS said that the motorcycle driver was driving at a speed of 89.2 kilometers per hour, although the permitted speed at that location was 50 kilometers per hour.
"The driver couldn't predict that the motorcycle would run at such a high speed," the judge said.
At that time the driver of an honorable car claimed to be driving at a speed of just 5-6 kilometers per hour.
The motorcycle driver who had seen the obstacle tried to stop and fell off the vehicle before facing the Škoda Fabia.
The prosecutor's office believes that E. Osipov, who was driving from the side to the main road, had to give way to the rider.
"Novaya Gazeta": Six Vagner mercenaries were killed in Syria
Among the dead were five Syrian troops and six persons belonging to the military company Vagner.
The source of Novaya Gazeta in Syria is announcing this.

Novaya Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking for information on the Russian fate.
The former King of Belgium will have to undergo a paternity test
This solution is a partial victory of artist Delphi Boel.
She has been seeking to recognize the child of the former monarch since 2013.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II, had a short love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old king denies fatherhood.
According to the RTBF station, he may appeal to the Supreme Court in opposition to DNA testing.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel, former husband of Delphi's mother, is not the father of the artist, either biologically or legally.
Delphi asked for the study to be recognized as the daughter of "real" father Albert.
The CEC will allocate money to parties, but will not give social workers anything
The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) is planning to allocate nearly 3 million people to major political parties this week. EUR budget.
This year, the ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Party (LSDDP), headed by Parliamentary Vice-President Gediminas Kirkilas, is not expected to allocate funds from the budget so far this spring.
But they can be assigned in the near future by a separate decision of the CEC if the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to the parties changes.
Laura Matjošaityte, Chair of the CEC, informed VZ that "this Thursday a commission meeting is scheduled to decide on a budget half-year grant for parties".
According to her, the CEC must take a decision on this issue by 15 November.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, are expected to be allocated 2,751 million. Eur.
The opposition Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than 0.66 million. Eur, the governing peasant and green union - about 0.55 mln. Eur, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about 0.5 million. Eur, the opposition Liberal Movement - almost 0.4 million. Eur, in the Seimas, which does not have its own political party in the Seimas - about 0.23 mln. Eur, recently to the ruling party in the Order and Justice Party, almost $ 0.22 million. Eur, represented in parliament, but neither the ruling nor opposition to the unpublished campaign of the Polish elections - the Union of Christian Families - about 0.18 million. Eur.
Under the current law, which will guide the CEC by allocating budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the statutory requirements and have received at least 3% of votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow LSDDP established this spring only to expect money from the budget.
Because this party has not participated in any of the elections so far.
True, the ruling coalition is trying to change the law, so that social workers get at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the run-up to the next three elections next year - municipal, presidential and European.
Corresponding amendments of the Political Parties and this year's budget laws adopted by the Seimas were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the representatives of the ruling p. Kirkilas and peasant-green leader Ramūnas Karbauskis believe that parliamentarians will seek to reject the president's contradictions.
However, this will not be possible before this Thursday's CEC meeting, so, according to p. Matjošaitytė, "the grants will be distributed according to the legal order that has existed so far."
It is true that the CEC leader did not rule out that if the Seimas rejected this or next week's presidential veto and a new amendment on the allocation of budget funds to the parties, the commission may consider a decision on the allocation of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"When we make a decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in force, because we are the executive body that has to implement the laws that we adopt," she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject the veto and the new laws came into force, the Government would separate the additional money for the parties by borrowing the corresponding amounts.
Grants already distributed to seven parties would not suffer from such a decision.

Poroshenko: The murderers of the activists Handziuk must be punished
"I want to say that no version - and more than 20 today - will be rejected.
Each will be carefully scrutinized in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As a president, I do not have the opportunity and do not have to get information that could undermine the course of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to find out the truth and punish evil, "said Poroshenko at a meeting with youth on Tuesday in Kiev.
He stressed that it was in his best interest that the murder of Mr Handziuk was clarified, and that the murderers, organizers of crime and clients would "take the necessary responsibility".
"After this case has been reclassified into a murder (case), they are quite rightly and rightly threatened with life imprisonment", said the President of Ukraine.
He called the public's right to openly and impartially investigate this case.
Mr Poroshenko stressed that the speeches of law enforcement representatives in the parliament should show that "the government is determined to grab criminals and kill them, whoever they are".
He also said that political speculation on this topic would not help to clarify the situation, but would be even more confused.
"I urge all, both power and opposition forces, not to waste unreasonable arguments and, in God, not to use this murder for public relations," the President said.
- On the contrary, we now have to unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, quick - to bring public confidence.
We just don't have another way. "
"No one will be allowed to use this situation to destabilize the country," he assured.
K. Handziuk, who fought against corruption, was attacked and soured in Kherson in July.
She was an advisor to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack but died in hospital on Sunday.
The police and prosecutors did not explain the perpetrators of this attack on Tuesday, the Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lucenka issued a resignation statement.
After her death, government officials have been accused by public activists of failing to properly conduct the investigation.
Activists also demanded the resignation of the Attorney General and the Minister of the Interior.
"I am presenting my resignation today," said Lucenka, Members of Parliament, reading their study report.
Parliament still has to accept the prosecutor's resignation.
Mr Lucenka accused activists of putting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of Mr Handziuk's murder.
Bill Gates introduced a toilet without water
When presenting a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional such devices to water-free to the computer revolution of the 1970s.
Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, introduced a high-tech toilet in Beijing that does not require water in plumbing pipes, Reuters said.
The toilet without water works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of wastewater types are recycled into chemical fertilizers.
"The technologies you see here are the greatest achievements in the sanitary field over the past 200 years," Bloomberg quoted Bill Gates.
Technological toilet was created at the expense of the charity fund set up by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
For seven years, we have been working on a device that could turn human waste into fertilizer or water, and the fund spent $ 200 million.
In total, about 20 toilet models were created by Bill Gates.
The device is now complete and can be sold.
But to make such toilets massive, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500,000 children under the age of five die every year due to bad sanitation.
The fight against poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, increases the spending on health, which is already 233 billion.
In order to better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates puts a jar with faeces in the toilet presentation.
According to him, this is a good reminder that in a small example "there may be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100 thousand worm parasite eggs".

Anxiety in France: people's death is a cause for concern
French health officials announced a permanent ban on a widely used pesticide on Monday, with concerns about dozens of people recently poisoned in the West.
The ANSES Health Agency has announced that the decision to ban all products with pesticides in metam has been taken after a new safety investigation that was launched earlier this year, at least three months ago, in the Department of Arts and Loire, which started in September.
In these cases, the government has already stopped using the pesticide.
This soil disinfectant should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
To be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, around 700 tonnes were used each year.
At least 70 people, including a large number of farm workers, in Angers, where a lot of salad juices are grown, complained of eye and sore throats, breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but did not hasten it," said Francoise Weber, Deputy Director of ANSES, on Monday at Ouest France.

Actor I. Elba was elected the sexiest man in the world
The US magazine People has announced this year's sexiest man in the world.
It was 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that this message was unexpected, he was not witty about the new title.
I thought "Can't be!
Seriously? ".
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought - yes, today I find myself sexually - laughing at the actor.
Speaking frankly, Idris said that this title was a very pleasant feeling that patted his ego.
The British star believes in frequent whimsy words and bullying, which made her childhood difficult because, as she says, she was "very high and rude".
The young actor did not believe in his peers and became the object of bullying and because of his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
"As soon as I grew my mustache and muscles I became the hardest guy in my city district," Idris smiles.
When her husband is not on the big screens, Elba works in a dancing party at Spain, especially in the bustling Ibiza.
In his spare time, a man enjoys Thai boxing and has a line of fashion that he develops through his own line of clothing.
The British actor believes the family is the most important thing in the world, so he is planning a wedding with his fiancée Sabrina Dhow.

Managers no longer require 20 km of waste incineration plants
The construction of the Vilnius Cogeneration Power Plant is under construction at Gariūnai Market.
Governors no longer intend to keep 20 kilometers from settlements when building waste incineration plants.
The Head of the Environmental Protection Committee "Peasant" Kęstutis Mažeika registered an amendment to the Waste Management Law on Monday, which waives such a requirement.
According to p. The Mazeika, a "peasant" group, who previously had a provision for a distance of 20 km, promises to support its refusal.
Mr. Mažeika's amendment foresees that from January 2019 waste incineration plants could be built according to the statutory environmental and public health protection requirements.
He acknowledges that the amendments led to the President's doubts about such a ban.
"Given the definition of a residential area, it is obvious that a place where the above-mentioned objects could be built would be almost impossible to discover," said the chairman of the committee.
In October, the governor opposed the president's veto amendments to tighten the construction of waste incinerators.
In addition to building waste incineration plants less than 20 km away from settlements, the amendments provided for the government to make decisions on the future of the two power plants that are already under construction, taking into account public health interests.
The latter provisions p. Mazeika does not propose to adjust.
In Vilnius, an energy group Lietuvos Energija builds a waste and biofuel-fired power plant and in Kaunas together with Fortum Heat Lietuva, a Finnish energy concern Fortum.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipeda.
It is a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
British and Irish leaders on Monday discussed a possible compromise on the complex issue of Northern Ireland, the shocking Brexit talks, Dublin said.
Speaking on the phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered the opportunity to review the so-called hedge arrangement mechanism, which would leave an open border between the UK province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland belonging to the European Union.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar promised to consider this proposal, but rejected any possibility for Britain to withdraw unilaterally from this agreement, according to a report published by the Irish Government.
In the conversation Th. May raised the possibility of reviewing the Mechanism of Hedged Instruments, which it mentions.
"Varadkar made it clear that he was open to reviewing new offers, provided that the outcome of such a review would not be linked to a unilateral decision to discontinue hedging," the government said.
Brexit negotiators do not find an acceptable solution to avoid border checks on the UK and Ireland when Britain withdraws from the single market and customs union next March.
Both sides agree on "hedged instruments" that have to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs controls at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied to the entire UK temporarily.
The Daily Telegraph said Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is seeking Britain to withdraw from the hedge agreement unilaterally three months later.
However, Mr Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government could "not support it".
"Three-month or limited-term hedging instruments are not worth the paper on which they will be written," he said.
In the past, London and Brussels did not approve the breakthrough of Brexit in the post-weekend report in Britain that the deal was at hand.
"I would say that we are making progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to do," said Th. May representative in London.
European Commission representative Margaritis Schin also told reporters: "We are not there yet."

The Seimas has adopted higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Product Safety Act, which stipulate that fines for product safety breaches should be increased.
The amendments were adopted unanimously in the Chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health Affairs said, with regard to the new project, it is to be welcomed that the objectives raised relate to better protection for consumers of products.
In addition, its provisions are in line with the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My mind, in the proposed bill, is better and more specifically distributed to all actors involved in the supply and distribution process: producers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice has shown, the current system of fines does not always prevent further infringements, as the operators who continue to pay fines continue to commit repeated infringements, "said Mr Vinkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy and was approved by the Seimas Economic Committee after approval by the Government.
Amendments to the Act aim at increasing fines for infringements, strengthening consumer protection, empowering market surveillance authorities and establishing a clear framework for product safety requirements and compliance.
According to the Ministry of Economy, producers are not currently obliged to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the Ministry, market surveillance authorities do not have the right to enter the territory of producers and suppliers, buildings, premises and inspections, and this makes the work of the institutions more difficult.
According to the Ministry, the six-month time limit for imposing fines and warnings is too short to establish an infringement, to investigate and to impose a fine.
Also, according to the Ministry, the fines imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often violate the requirements of the law - only 14 companies did it in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Economy has proposed to impose an obligation on manufacturers to properly label the product, thereby ensuring traceability to market surveillance authorities to clarify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the right to access inspections of economic operators who produce, market products, territory, buildings, premises and to carry out product safety controls.
Intended to increase fines for violations of the law.
A manufacturer, importer or authorized representative who has placed dangerous products on the market and a distributor, their supplying market, a service provider providing or providing dangerous services would be fined from 150 to 2 500 (now from 144 to 1 448).
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (SCRPA) or another market surveillance authority decides to ban the placing and placing on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, a fine of between EUR 1 000 and 5 000 (now from 868 to 4 344) would be imposed.
Failure to remove dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of between 2500 and 6 500 (now 1 448 to 5 792).
If dangerous products harmed the health of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 2 500 and EUR 15 000 (now EUR 1 448 to 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the consumer's death, a fine of between EUR 6 500 and EUR 25 000 (now EUR 5 792 to 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, up to 25 ths. EUR 26 million (no fine), Belgium: EUR 26 to EUR 600 thousand € 250 to € 6,666 in Romania, € 125 to € 7,500 in Bulgaria.

The agreements note that the RESC and US authorities will work together on the preparation of applications for international projects, exchange of expertise and knowledge, and expert visits.
