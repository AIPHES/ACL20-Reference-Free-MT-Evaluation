"Our solution was not something new.
The clarification as the Commission had already done in the month of July when the question was about Pagėgiai and Utena.
Then we said that under the statutes it is a matter of the Board's competence.
And if the board decides that some department can behave as it wants-go with the Committee and the Board approves it, then the chapter can go, but if the board decides that everywhere there will be party lists of what the board has accepted, then there is a solution that all The sections form a party list.
And if you do not agree with the board, then there is the possibility to stop membership and to go to the committee, "he added.

The villagers in northern India have run a tiger on the tractor, which previously tore one man on Monday by officials.
The forest-care officer Mahaviras Kaujlagi (Mahavir Kaudžlagis) said that when the man was torn down on Sunday in the field, the villagers were around, and they rode the beast in an attempt to escape.
The villagers say that this tiger is about 10 days ago also attacked and tore one young man.
The village concerned is located in the Dudhva Tiger Reserve in Lakhympur Kherio District, about 250 km south-east of the capital of Utar Pradesh, Laknau.
It is forbidden to have tigs in protected areas.
The director of Nature Ramesh Pandey (Ramunas Panday) said that the law on the wildlife protection will be reported to the police.
In April in the state of Utar Pradesh the Nighasano district of villagers broke another tiger; Serious injuries.
The tiger is an Indian national animal; Tigers are considered to be a endangered species under the Wildlife Conservation Act.
Last year's government figures show that at least one person killed every day in the previous three years in clashing with wild tigers or elephers.
People's conflicts with the Tigers have gradually increased since the 8th decade, when India has launched a Tiger protection program, according to which wildfires have been set up in national parks, and the possession of big cats has been criminalised.
Although the methods for the calculation of tigers have evolved, the census would indicate that the then 1 800 tiger population grew to 2 226 individuals in 2014 years.
Obligatory labelling of microchips for cats and dogs
Kęstutis Mažeika, chair of the Committee on the Environment of the Seimas, has registered with other members of the Seimas amendments to the Law on welfare and protection of animals, which propose compulsory labelling of cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips.
"We propose that cats and dogs must be labelled with a subcutaneous microchip and that their registration and labelling are organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the state Food and Veterinary Office.
In the 2019, all dogs will be labelled with public money and cats in the 2020, which means that the population would not be troubleming and the costs would be covered by specifically provided state funding, "said the chair of the Environmental Protection Committee of the Seimas Emma M.
Amendments to the law aim to resolve the systematic need for labelling of domestic animals.
It is hoped that this will help to avoid problems caused by non-responsible livestock breeders, illegal multiplies or vendors.
It is estimated that, according to the expected average price of the microchip and service, which will be around €5, the compensation of all owners of animals during the transition period would be considered.
The total cost of labelling all pets can reach up to €6 million. Euro.
These funds are planned to be distributed over a period of three years and will reach EUR 2 million each year. Euro.
It is envisaged that the labelling programmes will be allocated through a specific programme of municipal environmental protection support, the revenues of which are expected to increase this year, due to increased taxes on natural resources and the redistribution of resources.
Municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for the labelling of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other applications.
According to K. Mazes, the practice of mandatory labelling is common in almost all European Union countries, which allows the animals themselves to be protected (because they get lost easily can be returned to the owners) and saves the time of the breeders themselves, when A lot of time and money for the search for pet is lost.
In addition, EU legislation provides that travel is only possible with labelled pets.
At the same time, labelling obliges the responsible care of the animal throughout his life.
The previous proposals were compulsorily marked by resistance, as the programmes concerned were proposed to finance the population.
"This criticism should now be avoided because the protection of animals is proposed to finance the increased income in the Environmental Protection support Programme and the right to label it not only for veterinarians but also for the public, i.e. the animal Care institutions who have heard special courses at the Veterinary Academy ", says the authors of the project.
The bill was registered by a group of Seimas members representing different Seimas fractions-Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugene Gentvilas, Edmundas Fabinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

The animals were fitted with heart work gauges.
When the drone had approached one of the Bears to flee, others were not running anywhere, but all their hearts started to shake more often from the fright.
Scientists advise drones for animals to use to record responsibly, not to fly too close, not to raise noise and not to fly where prohibited.

On Tuesday, the political group of the Seimas's opposition to the homeland union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) reported that the band had contacted KT to investigate the compliance of the regulations adopted by the management of the Waste Management Act with the Constitution.

"MEPs point out that, in view of the way in which the law formulated a prohibition on the construction of objects of national significance (i.e. the distance to be determined and the concept of ' residence '), it must be concluded that the prohibition is disproportionately restrictive or even contradicting the essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste, since the established criteria are formulated in such a way that the population density and the distribution in the country The construction of such objects would be practically impossible throughout the territory of the country ",-adds to it.

The amendments to the law readopted by the Seimas will take effect as of 1 January 2019. The truth of the reigning already proposes to abandon the 20 km limit.
This proposal is planned for the autumn session of the Seimas.

Lion Air's crash cause: People who died were angry
The data from the black box liner of the shipwrected Indonesian air company Lion Air shows that at least four of its flights have experienced a malfunction in the speed meter, which was reported by investigators on Monday.
Soerjanto Tjahjono, president of the National Transport Security Committee (NTSK), said that a similar incident occurred in the last four aeroplane flights, including the fatal flight, where, on 29 October, Lainier fell off the sea of Java immediately after Central Jakarta.
This disaster killed all 189 people in the airplane.
A number of media outlets reported problems during a previous flight of Boeing 737 MAX 8, from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box-yes, indeed a technical problem was the speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the airplane"-said S. Tjahjana at a press conference.
"The black box data showed that during the two flights on the voyage, Denpasar-Jakarta was also the same problem," he added.
"There are a lot of rumors in social networks.
Now, we want to explain that the black box (persisted data) on four flights, during which there was a problem with the air velocity meter, was indicated by the NTSK guide.
During the meeting with the members of the family of fatalities, S. Tjahjono said that the information of the device recording the flight was consistent with the announcement that its speed and height had been changed in the event of the last flight.
The search teams have not yet found a second black box recording conversations in the pilot cab.
Lion Air stated that it had been repaired in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations through a flight from Bali to Jakarta by a technical fault.
One of the founders of RUSDI Kirana was not invited to speak to the Minister of Transport, Budi Karyos Sumadi, a meeting of the moderators of family members with officials supervising the investigation of the flight and the victim's own residue searches and catastrophe.
However, he stood up and folded his head, when the members of the family who were angry and heartbroken demanded that Mr Kirana, together with his brother Kusnanu, established himself in the 1999 of the Year, "Lion Air".
"Lion Air did not behave properly," said one man, who was present as a passenger in Shandy Johan Ramadan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island to which the airplane was flying.
"I want Mr Rusdi Kirana and his team to draw attention," he stressed.
-Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We have not been to our child, but Lion Air has not shown us any compassion. "
Following this meeting, Mr Kirana hastily went by avoiding the issues of journalists.
Many families await the results of the long-term recognition process.
The police medical experts have transferred almost 140 parts of the lavonyms to the remains of the people.
Only 14 victims have been recognised so far.
The relatives raised the question of why the liner was allowed to fly two months before, even though the flight from Bali to Jakarta on the 28th of October was a malfunction, including the drop in passengers who frightened a sudden downfall in the plane immediately after the takeoff.
Lion Air said that this defect was removed.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? -asked the son of one of the deaths.
-If not, the technicians concerned must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, not they claimed that the plane was allowed to rise again.
These bad technicians are obliged to answer according to the law that the plane crash in Indonesia is no longer the same.
S. Tjahjono said that a large amount of small wrecks and the fact that debris spread in a rather small area indicate that the liner was likely to be in the water while flying at very high speeds.
"The plane was seamless when dropped into the sea.
It is not in the air, and the aircraft engines, when it touched the water, acted in large-scale-it shows all of the broken turbine blades, "explained the officer.
Lion Air's liner shipwreck is the biggest aviation catastrophe in Indonesia since 1997, when Garuda's plane crashed near Medano and killed 234 people.
After the accident, the wreckage was called by the rescuers: a hit and a minor
On Monday night The Turtles were Plungė, the cars of BMW and Mercedes-Benz collided on the bridges.
Cars were encountered in the cactus, three injured people were reported.
It is reported that BMW's driver, born in 1999, went to the opposite side of the traffic and ran into the car Mercedes-Benz, which was born in 1967, and her daughter, born in 2005 M.
A BMW driver from the wreckage rescued firefighter-rescuers.
A girl from a Mercedes-Benz is in an accident to punch out the teeth.
All the victims are moved to the hospital.
Presidential palace: No artificial facilitations for referendum
After the Seimas confirms the suggestion of the authorities to reduce the referendum bar at the first section of the Constitution, the President will veto the amendments, and says her adviser, Mindaugas Lingė.
"For the Constitution more than half of the inhabitants voted-this is a requirement.
This and its replacement, especially in its first section of the articles, should certainly not be a lower majority.
It is easy to predict that the president is really vetmented, "-the adviser of Dalit Grybauskaite on Tuesday was told by the News Radio.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamental state subjects-the language, the flag, the territory, the capital, and State sovereignty-and therefore, by reducing the necessary number of votes to replace them, according to M. Harts, it would create a " Negative precedent "and" unmanaged risk ".
"In the opinion of the President, there is no need for artificial facilitations, it is more necessary to prepare for the referendum itself, you need more dialogue with people," he believed.
On Tuesday the Seimas plans to vote on the adoption of amendment of the referendum law.
It provides for the decision on amendments to the first and fourteenth paragraphs of the higher Protection Constitution to be adopted if, through a referendum, there are at least two-fifths of the citizens with electoral rights.
At present, in the first and fourteenth paragraphs of the Constitution, more than half of all citizens entitled to vote may change in a referendum.
Lithuania has a electoral right of approximately 2.5 million. Citizens: Half would be 1.25 million. Voters, two-fifths of a million voters.
This suggestion was born after the Seimas confirmed in September, with the presidential veto on corrections previously adopted in Parliament, mitigating the demands on the number of votes by changing citizenship in section 12 of the first chapter of the Constitution.
The bar is proposed to reduce the number of votes in preparation for a referendum on dual citizenship, and it should take place on 12 May and 26 May when the first and second rounds of the presidential election are planned.
The emigrated after the independence of March 11, 1990 years of age at this time, with the exception of some exceptions, may not have dual citizenship.
Dual citizenship is sought by the Lithuanian community of the world, but fears that under the current conditions a referendum would not happen-the vote would not come a sufficient number of people.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "Braška", so they need to be upgraded
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads starts to pick up strawberries, so it is necessary to renew it, says Communications Minister Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius Airport is a minimum task that the State must perform.
"The air transport infrastructure is already poin, as it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius Airport, which is not even in the far-forward planning, it is the minimum we must do "-the Conference of the Democratic Development Fund and the state of the magazine, on Tuesday, said Mr. Masiulis.
According to the minister, the next decade will be crucial, because important projects will have to be implemented-completed with the "Via Baltica", "Rail Baltica", built at the Klaipėda External port, renovated Vilnius and Kaunas airports, or perhaps built new airport .
"The next decade will be very important-we have to finish the integration of roads, railways, the external port of Klaipeda, to tidy up the airports, perhaps to decide on the construction of the new airport.
We must be awake, we are now starting projects that will benefit our potential after 10, 20 or 30 years, "said Minister of transport.
Mr. Masiulis repeated the lack of funding for road maintenance in recent years.
"The road situation is not improving yet, as the funds are not adequately targeted.
We are guing to build new roads, but even with minimum maintenance, for example on highway roads, there is a shortage of funds.
We must set an amount to the extent that road maintenance should be used if we want to improve their condition, "said Mrs. Masiulis.
He stressed that exports of Lithuanian transport services in the year grew by 18.6% and that the largest export market became Germany, ahead of Russia.
Mr. Masiulis criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU countries would be obliged to periodically return to the country of registration.
"We must strive for our exporters in Western Europe to feel at home.
In my opinion, it is absurd for tractors to get back home, as empty trucks, fired in Europe, would be driven by emissions.
Railways will be the main means of success, as the costs will increase so that part of the transport goes to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions, "said Mrs. Masiulis.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the transport sector generates 12.2%.
Lithuanian gross domestic product (GDP).
It employs more than 118.000 employees, running more than 7.500 companies.

Mr. Masiulis commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the Lithuanian image.
"Leaving the legacy of that old terminal would be a politically important step to demolished it and build a new modern arrival terminal to keep Vilnius from feeling in a modern country, rather than as interesting, truly unrepresentative of our As an innovative country "-last week, Mr. Masiulis said in the Seime.
Mr. Masiulis also reported that it was planned to build a completely new passenger terminal and airport in Kaunas with the Rail Baltica track, building an underground station.
This transport unit should operate in the 2026 of the year following the completion of the "Rail Baltica".
Last year Vilnius Airport was catered for about 3.7 million. People, this year is expected to 4.8 million. Passengers and, next year, 5 million.

The tragic fate of the couple: killing after just a few hours of marriage
In the southwest of the USA, the state of Texas was killed by a couple of early married couples just a few hours later.
24-year-old William Troy and his peers wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler died on Sunday shortly after midnight the helicopter cut into the hill 16 kilometres northwest of Juvaldis and 129 km west of San Antonio, said the local justice of the Peace Steven Kennedy.
Oddly enough, the disaster occurred after having been wronged by about 24 kilometers, exactly as many newlyweds were years old.
In the helicopter pilot 76 years, Gerald Douglas Lawrence was also killed.
The newlyweds studied at Samo-Houstono State University in the Texas State city of Hunter.
They were married on Saturday evening at the Queen's Ranch near Juvaldis and after the wedding, the family-owned helicopter took off.
The disaster occurred to the helicopter about 24 kilometres.
The newlyweds flew to the Sant Antonio International Airport, where they were going to go on a plane and fly honeymooners, said Kennedy, who did not indicate the ultimate couples ' destination.
"It's a very rocky, uneven terrain area, and the hill is about 120-150 metres high," said Kennedy.
Mr Lawrence was piled for many years in the family's aircraft.
According to S. Kennedy, he piled the helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should become clear what the pilot's physical condition was and whether it could be the cause of the crash.
The helicopter craided after about 5-10 minutes after takeoff.

Israeli premier new sanctions for Iran call for "historic Day"
"Today is a historical day," said B. Netanyahu, the members of his party, Likud, informed his office.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of President (Donald), Mr. Trumi (Donald Trame), the United States imposes particularly harsh sanctions against Iran, the strongest sanctions against Iran throughout the period when attempts have begun to curb his aggression," said the Israeli government Guide.
Earlier on Monday, the Israeli defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman (Avigermann), said that the new sanctions would give a "decisive" blow to Israeli actions in the region.
The measures that Washington refers to as "the strictest all-time sanctions" have been triggered by the decision to withdraw from the world powers agreement with Tehran on its nuclear programme, which was adopted in May, and has been controversial, by the latter.
The aim of the sanctions is to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which has fallen by about one million barrels a day since May and to cut Tehran from international funding.
Israel long ago opposed the aforementioned agreement with Iran and said that its scope and terms were too limited.
The Jewish state also says that the abolition of sanctions allowed Iran to finance militant groups and their own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria and has promised to prevent it from being established militically.
Other participants in the agreement with Iran-Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia-are opposed to the US decision and say that the agreement, as envisaged, has prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court restates the circumstances of a young motorcyclists ' death
The court will hear the witness's testimony in the death of a young motorcyclists in Vilnius, the north town.
The Vilnius regional Court held on Tuesday that, in order to find out all the relevant circumstances of the case, one witness of the case will be questioned at the next meeting on 26 November.
An acquitted sentence has already been published in the present case, but it is not disputed by the Public Prosecutor's office.
On August 22, the Vilnius City District Court brought an end to the car driver for the death of a motorcyclists accident, in 79 in the year, in the order of the rider, at a high speed, the motorcyclists travelled in the city and committed a gross violation.
The Vilnius regional prosecutor's Office requests the circuit Court to abolish the judgment of the District Court and states that E. Osipoin is the most guilty of accident, and the District court's findings are unfounded.
The conviction is also requested by the deceased rider family advocate.
The clash took place on August 11, 2015, about 15 hours, when the car Škoda Fabia, driven by E. Osipovo, ran from Lakūnai Street to Žirmūnai Street and faced the main road motorcycle.
The public prosecutor's office accused the man of violating the road traffic rules, which provided for the way, and caused a traffic incident-killing the main road of the motorcycle "Piaggo".
The initial police reports stated that the death of a scooter driver was killed, but later, after a study, it was found that the vehicle was comparable to a motorcycle.
Judge of Vilnius City District Court the BNS had been told by the experts that the motorcycle driver had travelled for a speed of 89.2 kilometres per hour, although the permissible speed at that point was 50 kilometres per hour.
"The car driver could not foresee that the motorcycle would drive at such high speeds," said the judge.
At that time, a driver of a worthy old car claimed to have travelled at speeds of just 5-6 kilometres per hour.
A motorcycle driver who saw the obstacle attempted to brake and fell from the vehicle before he encountered Škoda Fabia.
The Public Prosecutor's Office considers that, from the side to the main road, he had to give way to the rider.

Will allocate money to the parties to the CEC, but Socialworkers will not
The Central Electoral Committee (CEC) intends to allocate nearly €3 million to the largest political parties this week. Budget grant in the euro.
The management of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Working Party (LSDDP), chaired by Parliament's Vice-President Gediminas Kirkilo, is not yet intended to provide funds from the budget this year.
But they may be intended for the foreseeable future by the CEC, if the legal environment governing the distribution of the grants to parties is changed.
Laura Matjošaityte, chairman of the CEC, informed the GM that "this Thursday foresees a commission meeting to decide on the budget's half-yearly grant allocation for the parties".
According to her, the decision is to be taken by the CEC before 15 November.
The estimated seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, allocated 2.751 million. Eur.
Opposition Patriotic Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than 0.66 million. Eur, governing the peasant and green Union-about 0.55 million. Eur, opposition to the Social Democratic Party, about 0.5 million. Eur, the opposition to the liberal movement-almost 0.4 million. Eur, in the Seimas, for a party with no political group-about 0.23 million. A lot of the order and the Party of Justice, which recently joined the management, was almost 0.22 million. The euro, which is represented in the Parliament, but neither the govern nor the opposition, which is not published in the campaign of Polish elections-the Union of Christian families-about 0.18 million. Eur.
Under the current law, which will guide the CEC by allocating budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the statutory requirements and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last Seimas, municipal councils and Elections to the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow only this spring-set LSDDP to expect to receive money from the budget.
This party has not yet participated in one of the elections.
It is true that the governing coalition strives to change the law so that the socialworkers receive at least about a couple of hundred thousand euros in the coming years, for even three elections – municipal, presidential and European Parliament.
The respective Seimas amendments adopted by the political parties and the laws of the budget for this year were vetted by President Dalia Grybauskaite.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the representatives of the Reigers Mr. Kirkilas and the peasants-Green leader Ramūnas Karbauskis the belief that parliamentarians will seek to reject the objections of the president.
However, it will not be possible to do so until this Thursday's CEC meeting and therefore, according to Mr Matjošaitytė, "grants shall be differentiated according to the legal order hitherto existing."
Admittedly, the head of the CEC did not exclude that if the Seimas rejected this or next week the veto of the President and a new amendment concerning the budgetary allocation of funds to enter into force, the Commission may consider a decision on the appointment of an additional grant to individual Political forces, including the LSDDP.
"We will take a decision on the whole of the existing legal environment, because we are an executive body with the implementation of the laws that are adopted," she said.
If the Seimas is able to reject the veto and new laws enter into force, they may allocate additional money to the lots by the government, with additional borrowing of the corresponding amounts.
Grants are already allocated to seven Parties for such a decision not to suffer.

"I want to state that no version-but their today more than 20-will not be rejected.
Each will be carefully checked in accordance with the test procedures.
As president, I do not have the opportunity and do not have to obtain information that could undermine the course of the investigation.
But the government must ensure transparency, and law enforcement authorities work effectively.
Only then will it be possible to find out the truth and punish the evil, "-said P. Porošenka at a meeting with youth on Tuesday in Kiev.
He stressed that he is most of all interested, that Mrs Handziuk's murder would be clarified and that the murderers, the crime organisers and the sponsors would "assume the necessary responsibility".

The other way we just don't. "

The managing authorities no longer seek to maintain a distance of 20 kilometres from settlements when constructing waste incineration plants.
Environmental Protection Committee leader "peasant" Kęstutis Mažeika on Monday, the amendment to the Waste Management Act has been registered by the Seime, refusing such a requirement.
According to Mr. Mazes, the "peasants" group, who previously maintained the 20 km distance, the amendment promises to support the correction for its refusal.
Mr. Mazu's amendment provides that from January 2019 onwards waste-incineration plants could be built on statutory environmental protection and public health protection requirements.

It is about a possible compromise in the BREXIT negotiations
The leaders of Great Britain and Ireland discussed on Monday a possible compromise on the difficult issue of Northern Ireland, which has been the subject of the Brexit talks, which was announced by Dublin.
On the phone, the British premiere Theresa May proposed a review of the so-called hedgetable arrangement mechanism, which would allow an open border to be left in the United Kingdom's Northern Ireland province and the European Union Republic of Ireland.
The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkaras, promised to consider this proposal, but it dismissed any possibility for Britain to withdraw unilaterally from this agreement, which is said in a report published by the Irish Government.
In the conversation, Th. May, "raised the possibility of reviewing the mechanism of hedding measures", stated therein.
"Varadkar has made it clear that it is open to reviewing new proposals, provided that the outcome of such revisions will not be linked to a unilateral decision to put an end to hedgered measures", says the government report.
Brexit negotiators do not find an acceptable solution for avoiding checks at the United Kingdom and Irish land border when Britain will leave the single market and customs union in March next year.
Both parties agree on "hedding measures" to maintain the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, pending the signing of a larger trade agreement to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not be enforced.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants the United Kingdom to be temporarily applicable.
Daily Telegraph announced on Monday that the Brexit Secretary Dominicas Raabas is working to allow Britain to withdraw from the Hedding agreement unilaterally three months later.
But L. Varadkaras told journalists in Dublin that his government is "unable to sustain".
"The hedding arrangements for three months or a limited term are not worthy of the paper on which they will be written," he said.
In the past, London and Brussels did not confirm the information about the breakthrough Brexit talks after a weekend in Britain that the agreement was reached in the hand.
"I would say that we continue to make progress in the negotiations, but the work is still," said Th. May representative in London.
European Commission representative Margaritis Schinas also said to journalists, "We are not there yet."
Nobel Prize laureates call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including the Nobel Prize winners, issued a declaration on Monday, urging that the Internet epoch be entitled to reliable information.
Among the 25 persons who signed the international Declaration on Information and Democracy, the economists Amartya sung (Amartja sung) and Joseph Stiglitzas (Joseph Stiglicas), the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Širin Ebadi), as well as Nobel laureate writer Mario Vargasas Llosa
"We urge the leaders of good will to take action on all continents in order to strengthen democratic models and open public debates through which citizens can take decisions on the basis of facts," says the report of the group.
They argue that "a global area of information and communication" is a common good that "must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion".
"People have fundamental right to information which is freely collected, processed and disseminated on the basis of a commitment to the truth, the principles of pluralism of views and rational methods of fact-finding," added the authors of the Declaration.

The Seimas approved higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas endorsed amendments to the Law on product safety which provide that penalties for breaches of product safety must be increased.
Amendments to the meeting room are unanimously approved.
As member of the Committee on Health Affairs, Antanas Vinkus said, in the context of the new project, it is welcomed that the objectives set relate to a better protection for consumers of products.
In addition, its provisions are adapted to the requirements of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"In my head, the proposed draft law provides for an improved and more specific allocation of all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of penalties does not always prevent further infringements, as the entities that have paid fines continue to repeat infringements ", said A. Vinkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, after the government's approval the Seimas Economic Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
Amendments to the law aim to increase penalties for infringements, strengthen the protection of consumers ' rights, empower market surveillance authorities and establish a clear framework for product safety requirements and compliance.
As the Ministry of Economy argues, there is currently no obligation for manufacturers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the ministry, the market surveillance authorities do not have the right to enter the territory, buildings, premises and inspections of producers and suppliers in the context of public product safety control, which complicates the work of the institutions.
In the assessment of the ministries, the six-month deadline established for the imposition of fines and alerts is too short to identify the infringement, to investigate and to impose a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the fines imposed are not sufficiently effective.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law – 14 companies had done this in just 2017 years.
The Ministry of Economy has proposed to impose on manufacturers an obligation to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability in order to facilitate market surveillance authorities ' detection of non-compliant product suppliers.
It is also proposed to grant the market surveillance authorities the right to enter, in the context of public product safety controls, checks on the operators who manufacture, place on the market, land, buildings and premises.
It is intended to increase the amounts of fines for breaches of law.
The manufacturer, the importer or an authorised representative who has placed on the market dangerous goods and the distributor who made the services on their market would be granted a fine of EUR 150 to 2 500 (now between 144 and 1 448).
A fine of between 1 000 and 5 000 (now between 868 and 4 344) would be granted to the state Consumer Rights Protection Authority (IWD) or another market surveillance authority if it decided to ban the placing and placing on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services. .
In the absence of a requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them, a fine of EUR 2500 to 6 500 (now from 1 448 to 5 792) would be imposed.
If dangerous products have caused harm to the health of the consumer, a fine of EUR 2 500 to 15 000 (now from 1 448 to 11584) is imposed.
If dangerous products have caused the consumer's death, a fine of EUR 6 500 to 25 000 (now from 5 792 to 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, a breach of product safety legislation is granted up to 25 thousand. (Minimum amount of the fine is not established), Belgium-from 26 euros to 600 thousand euros. Euro fine, in Romania-from 155 euros to a fine of 6 666 euros, in Bulgaria-from 125 euros to a fine of 7 500 euros.
