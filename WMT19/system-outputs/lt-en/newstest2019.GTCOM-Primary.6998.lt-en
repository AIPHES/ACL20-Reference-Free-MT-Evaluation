This is not just a formal sitting, "said L. Belevičius.
The new lawyer A. Doroševas noted that he had not been able to get acquainted with either the indictment or all the case-file.
At the previous hearing, the suspect Šarūnas Gustainis announced that he was refusing his lawyer because he would no longer be able to pay him.
Audio recordings were also heard at the meeting.
Lawyers for the accused were outraged that the audio recordings submitted to the court were of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that politicians, when taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated decisions in favour of the Group in the Seimas and other state institutions, as well as had an impact on determining the winners of public procurement, remind ELTA.
During the pre-trial investigation more than 150 persons were interviewed, more than 50 of whom were members of the Seimas of the previous term, several former ministers and Members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 interviews and more than 30 searches were conducted.
It is suspected that Š. Gustainis received a bribe of more than 8 thousand euros, G. Steponavičius - 15 thousand euros, V. Gapšys - more than 27 thousand E. Masiulis is suspected of taking a bribe of more than 106 thousand euros.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trade in impact, the Liberal Movement is suspected of bribery, trade in influence and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of bribing these parties and trading in impact.
It is suspected that politicians consulted with the vice-president of the MG Baltic Group R. Kurlianskis on bribes and later offered or supported initiatives in favour of the Group at the Seimas or other institutions.
Ethics guardians: The Board of the Liberal Movement is right about the action of the Vilnius Department
"Decisions taken by the Board comply with the articles of association," - announced its leader Vytautas Tamošiūnas after the meeting of the commission.
"Our decision was not something new.
We had already made an explanation of how the commission had already done in July, when there was a question about Pagegiai and Utena.
We said then that, according to the statutes, this is a matter for the competence of the board.
And if the board decides that a department can behave as it wishes - to go with the committee and the board agrees to this, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has adopted, then it is a decision for all sections to form party lists.
And if you do not agree with the board, then there is a possibility to suspend membership and go with the committee, "he added.
According to V. Tamošiūnas, the party board will now decide on the next steps.
On 17 October, the Board of the Liberal Movement of the Party annulled the decision of the Vilnius City Division to participate in municipal elections not with the list of the party, but with the list of the newly formed election committee.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the liberals of the capital to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's statutes and the board's decisions.
By 31 October, the Vilnius Department had to cancel its aspirations to participate in municipal elections with a list of committees.
But the department did not.
Former head of the department parliamentarian Aušrinė Armonaitė has already left the Liberal Movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, former Chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus Šimašius, promising to seek another term of office as head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius, of which we are proud!."
He has also left the party.
The elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place in March next year.
Residents of a village in northern India drove a tiger with a tractor, which had previously torn one man, officials reported on Monday.
Forest Supervisor Mahavir Kaujlagi said that when tigrei torn the man who worked in the fields late Sunday, the villagers surrounded the beast and drove it with a tractor as the woman tried to escape.
Residents say that this tiger also attacked and torn one young man about 10 days ago.
The village in question is located in the Dudhva Tiger Reserve in Lakhympur Kher district, about 250 km southeast of Laknau, the capital of the state of Uttar Pradesh.
The hanging of tigers in protected areas shall be prohibited.
Ramesh Pandey, director of the reserve, said the case would be reported to the police under the Wildlife Conservation Act.
In April, villagers defeated another tiger in the Nighasan district of Uttar Pradesh, who suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is India's national animal; under the Wildlife Conservation Act, tigers are considered an endangered species.
Last year's government figures show that at least one person was killed every day in collisions with wild tigers or elephants in the previous three years.
Human conflicts with the tiger have been gradually increasing since the 1970s, when India launched a programme to protect tigers, which set up reserves in national parks and criminalised the galabiation of big cats.
Although the methods of calculating tigers have changed, censuses would indicate that the then population of approximately 1,800 tigers grew to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Mandatory microchip labelling of cats and dogs is proposed
Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, together with other members of the Seimas, registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, which propose mandatory labelling of cats and dogs with subcutaneous chips.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be required to be labelled under the skin microchips and that their registration and labelling should be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be marked free of charge with public funds and cats will also be labelled in 2020, so citizens will not be concerned and the costs will be covered by specially planned public funding, "said Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on the Protection of the Environment.
The amendments to the law aim to address the systemic need for labelling of domestic animals.
This is expected to help avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that all animal owners will be compensated during the transitional period on the basis of the expected average cost of the microchip and the service, which will be around EUR 5.
The total cost of labelling all pets can be up to €6 million.
The need for these funds is planned to be spread over three years, reaching €2 million per year.
It is expected that funds will be allocated to labelling programmes through the Special Programme for the Protection of the Environment of Municipalities, whose revenues will increase significantly this year as a result of increased taxes on natural resources and the redistribution of funds.
Municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for the labelling of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programmes.
According to K. Mažeika, the practice of mandatory labelling is common in almost all countries of the European Union, which makes it possible to protect the animals themselves (because lost animals can be easily returned to the owners) and saves the time for the breeders themselves, when the search for a escaped and lost pet requires a lot of time and funds.
In addition, EU legislation provides that travel is only possible with labelled pets.
At the same time, labelling obliges responsible care for the animal throughout its life.
Previous proposals for mandatory labelling met with resistance as the relevant programmes were proposed for funding from the population.
"The model now on the table should avoid this criticism, as it is proposed to finance animal protection through increased income in the environmental support programme and the right to label not only veterinarians but also socialists, i.e. persons in animal care institutions who have attended special courses at the Veterinary Academy," the authors of the project say.
The draft law was registered by a group of members of the Seimas representing different groups of the Seimas - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 members of government forces killed in Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
Arif Noori, a spokesman for the provincial governor, pointed out that seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that four other soldiers were injured during the attack on a joint army and police checkpoint in the Khogjani district.
According to A. Noori, during a three-hour battle with Afghan forces, six fighters were killed and ten more Taliban were wounded.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement to the media in which the movement takes responsibility for Monday's attack in Ghazni province.
Mr Noori said this post was installed two days ago in a strategically important area to cut off the Taliban supply route.
The post was completely destroyed during the attack.
"Morning" extended a helping hand to the Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the fourth round of the FIBA Europe Cup will take place at Vilnius Rytas Arena, where the clubs of Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
The duel will be held in the capital for political reasons.
Vilnius Rytas, which maintains warm relations with Ukrainian basketball, will accept Cherkaski Mavpy and KB Prishtina teams from Cherkaski Mavpy in Cherkaski Mavpy Arena under its roof on 7 November.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine we were unable to organize this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to accept us," Maxim Michelson, the head coach of the Ukrainian team, thanked Rytas.
- We have many friends in Vilnius and our countries always agree well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the best basketball countries in the world, so it will be a real honour for us to play here.
We hope that we will receive support from the residents of Vilnius.
The Kosovo team could not come to Ukraine because these countries have no diplomatic relations.
Currently, the Ukrainian team takes third place after the first round with one victory in three meetings, and the Kosovo team is in second position and has more victory.
This will be a crucial sight for Group E, as only two teams will enter the next stage.
In the past, Vilnius also hosted a match between the Ukrainian and Kosovo teams in the selection for the 2017 European Basketball Championship.
Then the Ukrainian team celebrated 100: 61 victory.
Basketball fans will be able to enter the match for free on Wednesday and the start of the duel at 7 p.m.
"Women lie better" star actress B. Arsobaitė is persecuted by liars
This is probably only a coincidence, but the charming brown-eyed actress Brigita Arsobaitė has been receiving roles related to liars for the umpteenth time.
First the series "Women lie better," then the performance "Fools" and finally the comedy "liars."
In this film Brigita plays the great wife of Dainius Kazlauskas hero.
"I really enjoyed filming in" Melagiai, "because I am more a theatre actress and rarely appear in cinema.
A wonderful team of colleagues promised an excellent result from the outset.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
However, the most interesting thing that happened on the court was puppy Sunny!
Throughout my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would really be big and serious.
I never admired those small, decorative "fiffs" four-legged.
However, during the filming, Sunny was so attached to me that the fondness became mutual and eventually I even wanted to buy it from the host, but without success, "the actress smiles.
The comical and intriguing peripetias of family members are already surrounded by a new Lithuanian comedy "liars," produced by the Lithuanian film hits "inexperienced" and "Between Us, Boys." Producer Paulius Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionov.
Your beloved has just announced - she is expecting.
It would be great news, only... your beloved is your brother's wife!
But that is not all.
Failing to publish "good news" to everyone, parents suddenly declare - they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this is happening just before the most beautiful holidays of the year - Christmas!
But the end will surprise you even more, because no one expected such an atomic.
All heroes are not what they seemed at first sight...
In addition to B. Arsobaitė's comedy "liars," four generations of film stars will present a good mood to the audience: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė giedraitytė, Liubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
Comedy "liars" - in movies since November 9
Decide whether to write off €100 million in unpaid taxes for emigrants
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted an amendment to the Law on Residence Declaration drafted by Ramūnas Karbauskas, the leader of "peasants."
56 members of the Seimas voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstentions.
The Seimas will continue to consider amendments on or after 6 December following the Government's conclusion.
According to R. Karbauskas, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarian, within three years one person does not pay about EUR 1 000, and now there are about 100 thousand such persons.
Algirdas Sys, a Social Democrat, regretted that in this way the Seimas would "urge some people not to comply with their obligations" - to declare their departure and then no taxes would be calculated.
Conservative Antanas Matulas, a member of the Committee on Health Affairs, noted that Lithuanians living abroad take advantage of the fact that they come to Lithuania for treatment with a small health insurance tax - they are provided with the same services as residents paying this tax.
The amendments provide that those persons who will pay social security contributions in the countries of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation would be considered to have left Lithuania and Sodra will have exempted them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevičius, the president of Sodra, has previously said that such a step will make life easier for both the emigrated people and Sodra.
Video on the internet about a slip teddy bear reveals a serious problem
Filmed as the mother bear climbs a steep snowy slope and the little one keeps climbing, slides down and stubbornly climbing again.
The video received many views and comments.
People marveled at the little bear's perseverance - after repeatedly slipping down, he went up to his mother again.
He succeeds not at first, but the little one does not try to give up and finally achieves his goal.
The video does ask attention, but it also reveals the threat to animals posed by humans.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people's desire to know wildlife can sometimes be harmful.
'it's obvious to me that bears were very frightened by the drone.
Their movements show that they are panicking.
If the drone were not flying around, they would probably have chosen a safer road or overcome it more slowly or carefully.
This is a great example of how Drones should not be used, "ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago, Ditmer and his colleagues investigated how Drons affect bears.
The animals were fitted with heart work meters.
When the drone approached, some bears made their way to run, others did not run anywhere, but the hearts of all of them began to beat more often from fear.
Scientists advise using drones to film animals responsibly, not to fly too close, not to make noise and not to fly where it is forbidden.
Addressed the fled president through a newspaper
On Tuesday, a Kiev court invited deposed President Viktor Yanukovych, who had left for Russia, to come to a hearing of the case for the betrayal of his alleged state in an unusual way - the summons were published in the state's Official Journal.
In a subpoena published in the government news newspaper Uriadovoj kurjer, the former leader is invited to come to a criminal proceedings hearing on 19 November, during which his closing arguments could be heard.
The document states that V. Yanukovych has the right to attend the meeting by video.
On 30 October, the Kiev court announced that it had closed the debate in the Yanukovych case.
V. Yanukovych's lawyer Aleksandras Gorošinskis, who works in Russia, was given the opportunity to register with the register of foreign lawyers until 19 November so that he could attend a meeting where V. Yanukovych is expected to speak his last word by video.
V. Yanukovych, supported by the Kremlin, was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the President's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader had been taken to Russia during a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine, and a little later there was a war between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country.
Since then, the fighting has claimed the lives of around 10,000 people, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a lasting ceasefire.
Valdas Benkunskas will lead the list of conservatives to Vilnius City Council
Dainius Kreivys, former Minister of Economy and MP, was already approved as the Conservative candidate for the year.
At the weekend during the Conservative primary elections, party members rated the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Municipal Council.
According to the party, V. Benkunskas, Chairman of the Conference of Vilnius Divisions of the TS-LKD, became the leader of the Conservative list.
The first ten candidates included members of Vilnius City Municipality Council Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adomas Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius SKAISTYS, Rasa Baškienė, former member of the Seimas Liutauras Kazlavickas, Chairman of the Young Conservatives League Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karazijaitė.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on 3 March next year.
Constitutional Court complains about restrictions on combined heat and power plants
As promised by the Seimas opposition, the Constitutional Court (CT) appealed against the decision of the ruling authorities to adopt a law on the possibility of halting the construction of waste-to-energy power plants.
On Tuesday, the Seimas Opposition Group on Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that a group of members of the Seimas appealed to the CT to investigate the compatibility of the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by the ruling parties with the Constitution.
"Parliamentarians stress that the provisions of the law aim to question ongoing waste incineration plant projects by entrusting the Government with new restrictions (20 km distance from the residential territory) before the entry into force of the law for waste incineration plants started in Vilnius and Kaunas," the report reads.
"Parliamentarians note that, given the way in which the law formulates a ban on the construction of waste management objects of national importance (i.e. setting a distance and defining the concept of" residential territory "), it should be concluded that this ban disproportionately limits or even negates the essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for energy production, as the established criteria are formulated in such a way that, given the density and distribution of the Lithuanian population in the country, it would be practically impossible to build such facilities throughout the territory of the country," it adds.
The appeal states that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The CJ has stated on several occasions that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and consequences that occurred before the entry into force of the newly adopted legislation.
In this case, the government is given the power to apply the law back on the basis of an undefined criterion.
Such legal regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security and the protection of legitimate expectations, and therefore the constitutional principle of the rule of law, "the appeal states.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas combined heat and power plants.
The suspension of ongoing projects would not only lead to hundreds of millions of financial losses for the state and huge losses for the Lithuanian population, but would also increase heating prices and increase environmental pollution due to the increasing amount of waste landfilling.
The appeal to the CT was signed by members from the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Movement, the Social Democratic Groups and Algirdas Butkevičius, the deputy elder of the ruling Social Democratic Labour Group.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to obtain 71 votes by the ruling votes to reject the amendments to the Waste Management Act adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė, which provide for the right of the government to suspend the construction of cogeneration power plants that have already started, and established a 20 km "quarantine" zone from residential areas to build such power plants.
Amendments to the law repeatedly adopted by the Seimas will enter into force on 1 January 2019. It is true that the ruling authorities are already proposing to abandon the 20 km limit.
It is planned to discuss this proposal already at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, it is not planned to waive the government's right to suspend projects that have already started.
CT will deal with this case in the order of order - not before a year.
Publicized the question-raising statistics of LeBron James at the Lakers Club
Lebron James' career start at the Los Angeles Lakers is not what he himself, organization and basketball fans expected.
The Lakers started the season with four wins and six losses, and such a weak start helped to create rumors about the possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
However, such speeches were reassured by the President of Basketball Operations, Magic Johnson, who stated that he would not dismiss the coach, but that better play was needed.
L. James, the biggest star of the team, should look at himself as well.
Although the forward's stats are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 assists.
However, it does not tell the whole truth.
During the first ten games of the season, other figures also emerged showing that the Lakers play better when L. James is not on the field.
Striker is unfavorable + / - statistics showing how many points more are scored or missed by the team when there are certain players on the field.
That's when L. James is on the field, the Lakers missed 30 points more than their rivals this season.
While he was sitting on the bench, the lakes earned 19 points more than their rivals.
The Lakers are currently going just 13th in the Western Conference, but a few victories can turn things over with their high feet.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian airspace in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania highly appreciates Spain's cooperation in NATO and its significant contribution to the security of our country and region," said Minister Linkevičius.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out NATO air police and air police strengthening missions in the Baltic States five times, including three times in Lithuania.
The last time Spanish Eurofighter destroyers were deployed in Šiauliai between May and August this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian airspace in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations on security, political, economic and strategic communication issues in the fight against propaganda are taking place between Lithuania and Spain.
L.Linkevičius expressed his hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to cooperate closely on European, transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga is Spain's fifth representative in Lithuania.
On 29 October, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented the distinctive letters to President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
V. Ačienė on the arrest of R. Ačas: I believe in the man's innocence and law enforcement
'it was the most unexpected thing for me that I could never think of.
On the other hand, the services are probably doing the work they are obliged to do.
Everyone is doing their job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is right and fair, that no unfair actions should be done, "V. Ačienė told BNS.
R. Ačas was detained by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday - law enforcement suspects that he, while still director of the Raseiniai municipal administration, took a high-value bribe and in return could create exceptional conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the Raseiniai bus fleet operated by the municipality.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly bribing Mr Ačas or of being involved in disguising bribes in various financial operations.
In April of this year, the Raseiniai District Municipal Council dismissed R. Ačas from his position as Head of Administration on the third attempt after expressing mistrust.
The former "barn" became a member of the newly established Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminas Kirkilas in March this year and suspended his membership of this party on Monday.
R. ačas unsuccessfully stood as a representative of the election committee "Tavo Raseiniai" in the mayor's elections a few years ago.
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to stand as a candidate in the election of the mayor of Raseiniai next year, but had not yet decided whether he would participate in the elections of municipal councils.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas with the list of the Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union and is a member of the Anti-Corruption Commission of the Seimas.
The politician says she will wait for further law enforcement action - it will depend on her removal from her job in the commission.
'I really don't make sudden decisions today, I think I'll make a decision this week.
I will see, if there is a need, what charges have been brought, I will naturally take one decision or another.
I probably need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - everything will be put in place, "she said.
Representative of the opposition conservatives at the Seimas Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė urged the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Pranckevičius and the leader of the "peasants" Ramūnas Karbauskas to distance themselves from the statements of the group's colleague Vida Ačienė and to withdraw her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission by moving her to work in another Seimas Committee or Commission.
She states that further work of V. Ačienė in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission would "arouse justified mistrust among the public and discredit the work of the important parliamentary supervisory commission."
The sensual music of Coldplay has also attracted famous Lithuanian couples
On an autumn Monday evening, many music and film lovers gathered for the preliminary premiere of the film Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams.
A group of well-known people came to the event: Jonas and Simona Nainiai, Ignas Lelys, Martynas Tyla and many others.

Documentary director Matas Whitecross met the guys of the band even when they still played in bars and gathered only a few dozen spectators.
In the film you can see shots from the concert backstage, rehearsals or leisure that have not yet been shown anywhere.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met in 1996 in college and founded Pectoralz.
Soon they were joined by bassist Guy Berryman and a little later by drummer Will Champion.
The group changed its name to Coldplay and exactly twenty years ago released its first record Safety, which included three tracks.
Of the 500 copies of the record, most were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, while only 50 copies of Safety went on sale.
Coldplay is now a world-renowned, respected and loved group that has released seven albums with more than 100 million copies sold.
In two decades, the group has won 107 various awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.

Grybauskaitė urges China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for investments by European Union (EU) countries and to facilitate foreign imports.
At the Chinese import exhibition in Shanghai, opening the Trade and Investment Forum, Dalia Grybauskaitė stressed that, seeing signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to "join forces to stop the spread of protectionism in the world," targeting the root causes of the tensions caused by trade wars, "overproduction and unfair competition."
"China's commitment to create a more attractive, open environment for investment is essential for the European Union, which is important when negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business feels welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property, "said Dalia Grybauskaitė.
According to her, the opening up of China is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The Lithuanian leader stressed that transparency of investments must be "above the interests of any business group."
"Transparency, the rule of law and strict compliance with international treaties must be essential for the environment of new investment relations," stressed Dalia Grybauskaitė.
"Corrupt capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China import exhibition is trying to mitigate criticism that avoids opening up its market and protects only its companies.
The exhibition involves the leaders of several countries, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions around the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, China currently ranks 25th among its export partners.
Last year, Lithuanian exports to China grew by 50%, which amounted to EUR 180 million.
At the same time, imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials are concerned that Chinese investment in Lithuania could bring unwanted political influence and Beijing's exclusive focus on Eastern Europe divides EU unity.

Cause of Lion Air plane crash revealed: Relatives of those killed are angry
Data from the black box of the crash liner of Indonesian airline Lion Air show that there was a speed camera malfunction on at least its last four flights, investigators reported on Monday.
Soerjanto Tjahjono, chairman of the National Transportation Security Committee (NTSK), said a similar rift occurred during the last four flights of the plane, including the fatal one, when the liner fell in the Java Sea on October 29 immediately after taking off from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board died in this disaster.
Many media have reported disruptions on the previous Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, the really technical problem was the speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane," Mr Tjahjono said at a press conference.
"Black box data showed that on two pre-voyage flights, Denpasar-Jakarta was also the same problem," he added.
"There are many rumours circulating on social media.
We now want to explain that in the black box (data remained) about four flights during which there were problems with the airspeed camera, "the head of the NTSK pointed out.
During a meeting with members of the families of those who died, Mr Tjahjono said the information from the flight data recording device was in line with reports that its speed and height had changed in an irregular manner when the plane took off on its last flight.
Search teams have not yet found a second black box recording conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air indicated that if a technical fault was detected during a flight from Bali to Jakarta, it was repaired in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
Rusdi Kirana, a co-founder of the company, was not invited to speak to the Minister of Transport and Communications, watchdog Karyos Sumadi, who moderated a meeting of family members with officials overseeing the search for the remains of the plane and victims and the investigation of the disaster.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that R. Kirana, who co-founded Lion Air with his brother Kusnan in 1999, present himself.
"Lion Air behaved inappropriately," said one man who presented himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island the plane was flying to.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to take note," he stressed.
- Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air didn't show us any compassion. '
After this meeting, Mr Kirana hastily left, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of a long process of identifying the dead.
Almost 140 corpses, loaded parts of human remains, have been handed over to police medical experts.
To date, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives wondered why the liner, which was launched two months ago, was allowed to fly, although there was a failure during the flight from Bali to Jakarta on 28 October, including causing passengers to be frightened by the sudden downfall of the plane immediately after take-off.
Lion Air said this failure had been rectified.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? "Asked the son of one of the dead.
- If not, the relevant technicians must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, not they said that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must be held accountable by law so that plane crashes do not happen again in Indonesia.
Mr Tjahjono said the large amount of small debris and the fact that debris spread over a relatively small area indicate that the liner probably crashed into the water at very high speeds.
"The plane was seamless when it fell into the sea.
It did not explode in the air and the aircraft's engines were operating in large revolutions when it touched the water, as shown by all the broken turbine blades, "the official explained.
The Lion Air liner crash is the worst aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people were killed when Garuda crashed near Medan.
Rescuers drove from the wreckage after the accident: The minor was also affected
On Monday evening on the road Cancer - Plunge, cars BMW and Mercedes-Benz collided at Tilvikai.
The cars collided with a kactomusha and three people were reported affected.
The BMW driver, who was born in 1999, reportedly went to the opposite side of the traffic and kaktomusha screamed at the Mercedes-Benz car, which was attended by his dad, born in 1967, and his daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued from the wreckage by firefighters - rescuers.
A girl from Mercedes-Benz has her teeth knocked out in an accident.
All the victims were taken to hospital.
President: There is no need for any artificial facilitations for the referendum
Once the Seimas has approved the government's proposal to reduce the referendum bar for the first section of the Constitution, which currently has greater protection, the President will veto the amendments, says her adviser Mindaugas lingė.
"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that is the requirement.
It should certainly be at least a smaller majority, especially for the articles in its first section.
It is easy to predict that the President would really veto, "Dalia Grybauskaitė" s adviser to domestic politics told News Radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamental things of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, therefore reducing the number of votes necessary to amend these articles, according to M. Lingė, would create a "negative precedent" and "open up unmanageable risks."
"In the opinion of the President, we do not need any artificial facilitations, we need to prepare more for the referendum itself, we need more dialogue with the people," he assured.
On Tuesday, the Seimas plans to vote on the adoption of an amendment to the referendum law.
It provides that a decision on amendments to the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution with a higher level of protection shall be taken if at least two fifths of the citizens with suffrage agree in a referendum.
Currently, Articles 1 and 14 of the Constitution can be replaced by a referendum by more than half of all citizens with voting rights.
Approximately 2.5 million citizens have suffrage in Lithuania: Half would be 1.25 million voters and two fifths would be one million voters.
This proposal was born after the Seimas approved in September the President's veto on amendments previously adopted in parliament, which relaxed the requirements for the number of votes in the amendment of Article 12 of Section One of the Constitution defining citizenship.
It is proposed that the bar for a referendum be reduced in the run-up to the referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential elections are planned.
Those who migrated after the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990 cannot currently have dual citizenship, with some exceptions.
The Lithuanian world community seeks dual citizenship, but fears that under the current conditions the referendum would not take place - a sufficient number of people would not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports are "Braška," so they need to be renewed
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads is beginning to crawl, so it needs to be upgraded, says Minister of Transport and Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, renovation of Vilnius airport is the minimum task that the state must perform.
"The air transport infrastructure is already strawberry as it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius airport - this does not even fall under long-term planning, that is the minimum we must do, "Mr. Masiulis said at a transport conference organised by the Endowment for Democratic Development and the magazine" Valstybė. "
According to the Minister, the next decade will be extremely important because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the construction of Klaipeda external airport, the renovation of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, or possibly the construction of a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we need to complete the integration of roads, railways, construction of an external port in Klaipeda, clean up airports, perhaps decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, we must already start projects that will exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years' time, "the Minister of Transport and Communications said.
Mr Masiulis reiterated that too little money has been allocated to road maintenance in recent years.
"The state of the roads is not yet improving due to insufficient funding.
We are able to build new roads, but even for the most basic maintenance, such as expressways, there is a lack of funds.
We must determine the amount that should be allocated for road maintenance if their condition is to improve, "said Mr. Masiulis.
He stressed that exports of services in the Lithuanian transport sector grew by 18.6% this year and Germany became the largest export market, bypassing Russia.
Mr. Masiulis once again criticized the European Commission's proposal, which will require carriers from EU countries to return trucks to their country of registration periodically.
"We must make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposal for tractors to constantly return home is absurd, because empty lorries would drive in Europe, burn fuel and increase emissions.
The main winners from this will be the railways, as the costs will increase to such an extent that part of the transport will go to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions, "said Mr. Masiulis.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the transport sector accounts for 12.2%.
Lithuania's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
It employs more than 118.000 employees and has more than 7.500 companies.
Dispute with the heirs
Last week Mr. Masiulis announced in the Seimas Economic Committee that he had started negotiations on changing the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building, which would allow to demolish the old terminal and build a new one.
However, Algimantas Degutis, interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD), called Mr. Masiulis's deliberations political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the 1950s is a value recorded in the register in 1993, and it is not for politicians, but for specialists to decide on its removal.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving Lithuania's image.
"It would be a politically important step to remove that old terminal from heritage so that it can be demolished and build a new modern arrival terminal so that it can feel in a modern country when it arrives in Vilnius and not so interesting, certainly not representing our country as innovative," Mr. Masiulis said at the Seimas last week.
Mr. Masiulis then also announced that it was planned to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and to connect the airport to the Rail Baltica track by building an underground station.
This transport hub is expected to operate in 2026 after the completion of the Rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year 4.8 million passengers are expected, and next year - 5 million.
Kaunas Airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers last year.
What do Lithuanian troops do in Afghanistan?
BNS present the tasks they carry out.
In total, almost 50 Lithuanian troops serve in Afghanistan.

Will start direct flights from Vilnius to Madagascar next year
In the spring of next year, the largest regular passenger plane Boeing 767 will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly travellers from Lithuania directly to the island of be belonging to Madagascar, based on information from the tour operator Itaka Lietuva, the portal madeinvilnius.lt writes.
It is announced that Blue Panorama airline passengers will be able to choose between 259 economy class and 8 business class seats.
The new holiday destination will be available directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominikas Milowski, CEO of Itaka Lietuva, says that he is trying to offer new holiday destinations to tourists from Lithuania.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
Other tour operators have also prepared new holiday destinations for the summer 2019 season.
For example, Novaturas and Itaka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance on a possible crisis: It is important not to talk about the disease
"We always have to prepare for more difficult times.
What I want to welcome is that for the third year in a row we are accumulating reserves for the first time in Lithuanian history.
But also a very important thing is not to communicate the disease, "V. Šapoka said during his visit to Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday the Minister of Finance and Deputy Minister Miglė Tuskienė are attending meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed that agreement be reached on how revenues from the provision of certain digital services in EU Member States are to be taxed until there is consensus at global level.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the Italian draft budget as not meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC has made use of this opportunity.
Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain have been requested to provide more information.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union: Options for implementing the European Deposit Insurance Scheme and reforms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role for the ESM in financial assistance programmes, but it is considered that the functions of the ESM need to be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication between the ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Buračas.
Lithuanian working traditions and customs
Recently it was 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicler, ethnographer and ethnographer Balys Buračas (1897-1972) in Sidariai, Šiauliai parish, then Šiauliai governorship.
Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian State, we have a great opportunity to remember how the life-hungry national revival called many Lithuanian people, including the Buračai brothers - Bali, Jonas, Bronius - from the very depths of the village to engage in all creative ways in the promotion, meaning and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Buračas, who has traveled around his native land with a camera in his hands for more than 50 years, gave a wide and realistic picture of our country's customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing deposits of national culture and had a rare ability to comprehend the lasting value of the work he was doing.
In Balys Buračas "photographs, the Lithuanian landscape, mounds and our people in everyday and festive environments decorated pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication contains a significant part of Balys Buračas "legacy dedicated to the description of national working customs and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the specificity and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilisation over the last century, despite two world wars and difficult occupation.
The manuscript of the book is very rich in works written by residents of interwar Žemaitija, especially Kupiškėnai, Šiaulėnai, telšiškiai, as well as Aukštaitija and Dzūkija, their festivals and other traditions and customs Balys Buračas.
From the approximately 10,000 negatives stored in museums and archives, over 400 rare photos, mostly not yet published, have been selected for this publication, which are grouped according to selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture typical of Kupiškėnai, Dzūkai, other districts of Aukštaitija and Žemaitija.

Tragic fate of a couple: Died after just a few hours of marriage
In the southwest of the US state of Texas, a couple of newlyweds married just hours earlier died in a helicopter crash.
William Troy Byler, 24, and his fellow wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler died on Sunday shortly after midnight when the helicopter entered the hill 16 km northwest of Juvaldi and 129 km west of San Antonio, said local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
It is strange that the disaster occurred after a flight of around 24 kilometres, just as the newlyweds were years old.
The helicopter pilot, 76-year-old Gerald Douglas Lawrence, was also killed.
The newlyweds studied at Sam Houston State University, located in Hantsville, Texas.
They were married on Saturday evening at the Byler family ranch near Juvaldi and flew in a family-owned helicopter after the marriage celebration.
The disaster occurred when the helicopter flew about 24 kilometres.
The newlyweds flew to Sant Antony International Airport, where they were going to board a plane and fly honeymoon, said Mr Kennedy, without specifying the couple's final destination.
"It's a very rocky, uneven terrain area, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high," Ms. Kennedy said.
G. D. Lawrence has been piloting that family's aircraft for many years.
According to Mr Kennedy, he was piloting helicopters and serving in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should become clear what the physical condition of the pilot was and whether it could not have been the cause of the crash.
The helicopter crashed about 5 to 10 minutes after taking off.
His debris charred a wide radius on a rocky hillside and the hull remained "dangerously overhanging," air safety investigator Craig Hatch from the National Transportation Security Board (NTSB) said at a press conference on Monday.
Investigators are going to remove the debris and then inspect it thoroughly, but it will not be easy for the tractor and truck to reach that place, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been determined and a preliminary NTSB report should be published in two weeks' time.
Israeli Prime Minister calls entry into force of new sanctions against Iran a "historic day"
"Today is a historic day," said Netanyahu to MPs from his Likud party, his office reported.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of President (Donald) Trump, the US is imposing particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the harshest sanctions on Iran in all the time that efforts to curb its aggression have begun," the head of the Israeli government said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman stated that the new sanctions would deal a "decisive" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls the "strictest sanctions of all time," were introduced following Mr Trump's May and controversial decision to withdraw from the global powers agreement with Tehran over its nuclear programme.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which have already fallen by around a million barrels a day since May, and to cut Tehran off from international financing.
Israel has long opposed the agreement with Iran and says that its scope and deadlines are too limited.
The Jewish state also says the lifting of sanctions has enabled Iran to finance groups of fighters as well as its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria and has promised to prevent it from establishing itself there militarily.
The other participants in the agreement with Iran - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - do not support the US decision and say that the agreement, as intended, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
Court again narrates the circumstances of the death of a young rider
In the case of an accident that resulted in the death of a young rider in Vilnius, North Town, the court will hear the testimony of a witness.
Vilnius Regional Court decided on Tuesday that one of the witnesses to the case will be interviewed at the next hearing on November 26 in order to find out all the significant circumstances of the case.
A conviction has already been handed down in this case, but the Public Prosecutor's Office does not agree with it.
On 22 August, Vilnius City District Court acquitted a car driver, 79-year-old Eduard Osipova, of a fatal motorcycle accident, announcing that the rider drove at high speed in the city and committed a gross violation.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office asks the district court to annul the verdict of the district court and states that E. Osipov is the main fault of the accident and that the conclusions of the district court are unfounded.
The family lawyer of the dead rider also asks for the conviction to be lifted.
The accident occurred on 11 August 2015 at about 3 p.m. when the Skoda Fabia car driven by E. Osipovo entered Žirmūnai Street from pilot street and collided with a motorcycle on the main road.
The prosecutor's office accused the man of violating road traffic rules intended to give way and causing an accident - the death of a man on the main road on a motorcycle Piaggo.
Initial police reports indicated that the scooter driver died, but later, after investigations, the vehicle was found to be on a par with the motorcycle in terms of power.
Vilnius District Court Judge Rolandas Bužinskas told the BNS that the experts found that the motorcycle driver drove at 89.2 kilometers per hour, although the permissible speed at that place was 50 kilometers per hour.
"The car driver could not predict that the motorcycle would be driving at such a high speed," the judge said.
At that time, the driver of the honourable car claimed to have been driving at a speed of just 5-6 kilometres per hour.
When the motorcycle driver saw the obstacle, he tried to stop and fell from the vehicle before colliding with Skoda Fabia.
The prosecutor's office believes that E. Osipov, who drove from the side to the main road, had to give way to the rider.
Novaja Gazeta: Six Vagner mercenaries killed in Syria
The dead include five Syrian troops and six persons belonging to the military company Vagner.
The source of Novaja Gazeta in Syria announces this.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5th Syrian Military Corps was deployed in the area, to which a number of Syrian volunteers and "military mercenaries" also joined.
Novaja Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for information about the fate of the Russians.
Former King of Belgium to undergo paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for the artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking recognition as a child of the former monarch since 2013.
A 50-year-old woman claims her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II, had a considerable love novel decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies fatherhood.
According to the station RTBF, he can go to the Supreme Court by resisting DNA testing.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel - Delphine's mother's former husband - is not the artist's father either biologically or legally.
Delphine applied for a relevant investigation so that the daughter of "real" father Albert could be recognised.
HEC will distribute money to the parties, but will not give social workers anything
The Central Electoral Commission (HEC) intends to distribute a budget grant of almost EUR 3 million to the largest political parties this week.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), established this spring and led by Gediminas Kirkilas, the vice-president of the parliament, is not yet scheduled to receive funds from the budget.
But they can already be awarded in the near future by a separate EC decision if there is a change in the legal environment governing the distribution of grants between parties.
Laura Matjošaitytė, president of the CEC, informed the VŽ that "a meeting of the commission is scheduled this Thursday to decide on the distribution of the budget's half-yearly grant between the parties."
According to her, the CEC has until 15 November to decide on this issue.
It is planned to distribute EUR 2.751 million to seven parties, six of which are parliamentary.
The opposition Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than EUR 0.66 million, the ruling Union of Peasants and Greens - about EUR 0.55 million, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about EUR 0.5 million, the opposition Liberal Movement - almost EUR 0.4 million, the Labour Party, which does not have its own group in the Seimas - about EUR 0.23 million, the recently joined the Sustainable and Justice Party - almost EUR 0.22 million, but not represented by the opposition parliament - about EUR 18 million.
Under the current law, which will guide the HEC in allocating budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections to the Seimas, Municipal Councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow the LSDP, which was set up only this spring, to expect money from the budget.
Because this party has not yet participated in any of the elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that the social workers receive at least a couple hundred thousand euros in the run-up to the three elections next year - municipal, presidential and European Parliament.
The corresponding amendments adopted by the Seimas to the laws on political parties and this year's budget were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but representatives of the ruling parties P. Kirkilas and the leader of the peasant-Greens Ramūnas Karbauskis argue that parliamentarians will seek to reject the President's objections.
However, this will not be possible until this Thursday's HEC meeting, therefore, according to Ms. Matjošaitytė, "grants will be allocated according to the legal order that has existed so far."
However, the head of the HEC did not rule out that if the Seimas rejected the President's veto this week or next week and new amendments on the allocation of budgetary resources to the parties enter into force, the panel may consider the decision on the award of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"When making our decision, we will take into account all the existing legal environment because we are an executive that has to implement the laws that are being adopted," she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject the veto and the new laws enter into force, they would allocate additional money to the parties by the Government, having borrowed the corresponding amounts for this purpose.
Grants already distributed to seven parties would not suffer as a result of such a decision.

Poroshenko: Supporters of murder of activist Handziuk must be punished
"I want to state that no version - and more than 20 today - will be rejected.
Each will be checked very thoroughly in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As President, I do not have the opportunity and I do not have to obtain information that could undermine the progress of the investigation.
However, the authorities must ensure transparency and law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to find out the truth and punish evil, "said P. Poroshenko at a meeting with young people on Tuesday in Kiev.
He stressed that he was most interested in clarifying the murder of K. Handziuk and that the murderers, the organizers and sponsors of the crime "take the necessary responsibility."
"After this case has been retrained into a murder (case), they are quite rightly and reasonably threatened with a life sentence," the President of Ukraine said.
He rightly called the public's demand for an open and impartial investigation into the case.
Poroshenko stressed that speeches by representatives of law enforcement authorities in parliament should show that "the authorities are determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice, whoever they may be."
He also said that political speculation on this subject would not help to clarify the situation, but would further confuse everything.
"I urge all forces, both government and opposition, not to waste unfounded arguments and, defend God, not to use this murder for public relations," the president said.
- In contrast, we must now unite to ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, rapid - in such a way as to arouse public confidence.
There is simply no other way for us. "
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation to destabilise the country," he assured.
Ms Handziuk, who fought against corruption, was attacked and covered with acid in Cherson in July.
She was an adviser to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
After the attack, the woman was hospitalized but died in hospital on Sunday.
If the police and prosecutors did not explain the perpetrators of this attack, Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lucenko delivered a statement of resignation on Tuesday.
After her death, government officials received accusations from public activists that they were unable to carry out the investigation properly.
The activists also demanded the resignation of the Attorney General and the Interior Minister.
"I am making my resignation statement today," Lucenka told MPs as he read his investigation report.
Parliament has yet to approve the resignation of the prosecutor.
Mr Lutsenka accused the activists of putting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of Mrs Handziuk's murder.
Bill Gates presented the toilet without water
Presenting a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional such facilities to without water supply with the computer revolution of the 1970s.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates presented a high-tech toilet at an exhibition in Beijing that doesn't need water in water supply pipes, Reuters reported.
A water-free toilet works in accordance with the principle of separation between solid and liquid waste.
Both types of wastewater are processed into chemical fertilisers.
"The technologies you see here are the greatest achievements in sanitation in the last 200 years," Bill Gates was quoted by Bloomberg.
The technological toilet was created with the support of a charity foundation set up by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Over seven years, work has been carried out on a facility that could convert human waste into fertilisers or water, for which the fund has spent $200 million.
In total, about 20 toilet models were created, according to Bill Gates.
The facility is now complete and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be produced en masse, the Gates Fund is ready to spend a further 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500 thousand children under the age of five die every year as a result of poor sanitation conditions in the world.
Combating poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, increases the funds spent on health, which already amount to 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitation situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates in a toilet presentation jar with feces.
According to him, this is a good reminder that a small example "may contain 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 000 bacteria causing infectious diseases, and 100 thousand worm parasite eggs."

Concerns in France: Deaths are a cause for concern
French health officials announced a permanent ban on the widely used pesticide on Monday, following concerns about several dozen people who have recently been poisoned in the west of the country.
The health agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all products containing pesticide methane was taken following a new safety inspection launched earlier this year, even before at least three waves of poisoning in the Department of Art and Loire that started in September.
As a result of these cases, the government had already suspended the use of the pesticide.
This soil disinfectant should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, around 700 tonnes were used each year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, in the Angers region, where many salad juices are grown, complained about tingling of the eyes and throat and breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but they have not hastened it," Francoise Weber, deputy director of ANSES, told Ouest France on Monday.
The methane - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and Europe - is considered a "likely human carcinogen" by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA).
This pesticide, sold under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is permitted in Europe until 2022, when a new safety check is to be carried out.
"There was no choice but to remove him from the market, regardless of whether there are alternatives to him," Mr Weber told the newspaper in question.
"We understand the difficulties that salad paw growers, farmers in general, will face, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to halt the use of metam in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
More than half of the 35 000 tonnes of lettuce consumed annually in Europe are grown in this region near Nantes.
Next season there will be "much less salad lettuce, radishes and pores," Philippe Retiere, head of the Nantes Producers' Federation, told AFP last month after the government suspended the use of metam.
EUR 70 million invested in shopping center with sightseeing wheel in Tallinn
Next weekend, a new T1 shopping centre is opened in the capital of Estonia, in which the local capital real estate (real estate) development company Pro Kapital Grupp invested EUR 70 million.
The shopping centre with a total area of 130,000 sq. m, or 55,000 sq. m leased, will have 150 shop services or entertainment venues, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, according to the developer's report.
By comparison, the total area of Vilnius Akropolis (calculated together with the area for offices) is about 110.000 sq. m. And the rented area is 91.000 sq. m.
T1 is the first shopping centre with a viewing wheel on the roof, according to the developer.
It will be operational early next year.
In addition, international transport gates will also be integrated into the territory: A tram stops nearby and intercity buses will soon run.
Nearby there is also the main Rail Baltica terminal, which is forecast to serve 1 million passengers per year around 2026.
Paol Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says fundamental changes are taking place in the global supermarket business and T1 has succeeded in putting them at the forefront.
"We have created a new generation shopping centre that provides emotions and experience inaccessible online.
It is a place of attraction for people in the very centre of the city, travellers "gates, an impressive and noteworthy object to visit and at the same time a qualitatively spent time with friends or family," Mr. Michelozzi is quoted in the press release.
Strong focus on entertainment
According to the manager of the shopping centre, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery centre in the Baltic States.
A total of 12,000 sq. m, or a fifth of the total rented area, has been allocated for entertainment at the facility.
Exclusive accent - a viewing wheel on the roof.
It will raise guests to a height of 120 m above sea level - only a TV tower is higher in Tallinn.
Under the observation circle, on the fourth floor, there will be a trampoline park "Super Skypark," which will open the largest trampoline centre in Europe and the first basketball and volleyball court on trampolines in Estonia, according to the company.
In the interactive research and discovery centre of SkyLAB, children are promised to occupy at least 5-6 hours.
The entertainment complex will also host 360 degrees panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the usual cinema shown in six halls, visitors will also be able to feel into a virtual reality cinema with interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to visual effects and moving chairs according to the rhythm of the film, the sense of realism here will be strengthened by the perceptible effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as the selected scents, smoke or fog in the cinema hall.
According to the developer, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonia's revenues from tourism by EUR 13 million per year, attracting over 300.000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic exchange as well as on the Frankfurt exchange.
Last year the group earned sales income of EUR 1.8 million in Lithuania and suffered losses of EUR 350,000, according to the financial statement of Pro Kapital Grupp.
In 2016, the Lithuanian market generated sales revenues of almost EUR 9 million and a net profit of EUR 2.4 million.
The shopping centre T1 was built by the Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
President Paul Biya sworn in for a seventh term after controversial elections in Cameroon
At a ceremony supervised by the Speaker of Parliament, Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, 85-year-old Mr Biya promised to protect the "integrity and unity" of the West African state.
Africa's oldest president, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was declared the winner in the elections on 7 October, with 71% of the votes.
However, the elections were overshadowed by low turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Mr. Biya's inauguration, 79 students and three school employees, including the principal, were kidnapped at one Presbyterian school in the Northwest region, where English-speaking separatists are waging an armed campaign for independence.
The majority of Cameroon's 22 million inhabitants are French speakers and a fifth are English speakers.
In 2016, the North West and neighboring Southwest province started demanding autonomy in the event of dissatisfaction about alleged discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy.
In 2017, when Mr. Biya refused to appease, the radicals declared an independent state, the "Republic of Ambazonia," and raised their arms.
According to non-governmental organisations, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces were killed in separatist attacks and government retaliatory operations this year.
More than 300 000 people have fled violence: Some across the border to Nigeria, but many are forced to live in semi-famine in the forests.
In the elections in October, only 5% of voters voted in the North West region and 15% of the electorate in the Southwest province.
In both parts of the country, Mr. Biya got two-thirds of the votes.
Conservative primary election: Mistakes caused by inexperience
"Something was lacking in places - realize that the party organized everything with its resources.
Some municipalities allowed their premises to be used, but there were not voting cabins everywhere because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank you to those who lent, "the politician said.
According to him, complaints were received, but their content does not change the substance and the violations themselves are not of a malignant nature.
"There have been complaints.
Not all the people who took part in the elections had experience - it was also news to them.
So not all the actions of this inexperience were in line with our procedures.
It was therefore necessary to warn the CRC to comply with the principles we described.
Those complaints do not, however, give rise to doubts about the results, "said A. Anušauskas.
According to the President of the CRK, there were cases where the voting ballots were unstamped - when they learned about this, the ballot papers found in the ballot boxes were annulled without a stamp.
Some towns lacked space, but according to A. Anušauskas, complaints and violations related to several dozen ballots.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, it really does not make a fundamental difference to the election results," explained A. Anušauskas.
The turnout of party members in the elections is said to have been 55%, while the turnout of Nonpartisan voters was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked in commissions.
The results announced on Sunday also remain unchanged, with 79% of voters (16418 votes) voting for the winning Ingrid Šimonytė, while 21% (4441 votes) voted for Vygaudas Ušackas.
On 17 November, the Council of the TS-LKD will officially support I. Šimonytė "s candidacy in the country's presidential elections in May next year.
Short says probably won't meet Putin in Paris
White House national security adviser John Bolton said earlier that Mr Trump would meet Putin in Paris, where events to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War will take place this week.
However, leaving for the last rallies ahead of the US Congress mid-term elections, Mr Trump told journalists he was not sure whether this would be the right opportunity to meet the Russian president.
'I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not, "the US President noted.
However, the head of the White House added, they will see them at the G-20 summit and "probably meet many times" afterwards.
Mr Trump is still trying to "reboot" relations with Moscow, despite allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 US presidential election.
Kęstutis Strupas requests annulment of VTEK decision
Kęstutis Strupas, former Director General of Santaros Klinikos of Vilnius University, asks for the decision of the Chief Official Ethics Commission (VTEK) to be annulled, recognising that timely undeclared transactions are already in breach of the law.
The complaint of K. Strupas was examined by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be announced on 26 November.
The applicant requests the annulment of the decision of the VTEK on 23 May, BNS was notified by the representative of the court Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduone.
K. Strupas believes that gifts given to relatives should not be declared, he says he understood the exception to the law.
VTEK announced in May that the then removed Director General of Santaros Klinikos K. Strupas and Silvija Strupienė, Head of the Outpatient Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
The investigation found that four transactions were declared not in accordance with the deadlines: A loan taken from the bank with the spouse in 2010, the acquisition of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift given to the daughter in 2017 - an apartment and a loan granted and not recovered together with the spouse in 1996.
S. Strupienė also declared these transactions by missing deadlines.
Persons who violate the law on the coordination of public and private interests in the public service may not be encouraged for a year.
The law obliges to declare not only your own data, but also the data of the spouse.
The study was conducted by VTEK on the basis of Info TV television information.
It was examined whether K. Strupas and his spouse S. Strupienė, head of the outpatient rehabilitation department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, properly and timely declared their transactions.
As announced by "Info TV," last year K. Strupas gave his daughter real estate worth 125 thousand euros.
However, the former head of Santaros Clinics and his wife had not indicated the above data in their declarations of interest.
Law enforcement has suspected K. Strupas, together with at least ten other persons, in the corruption investigation - according to law enforcement, for winning public procurement of computers and software in clinics, illegal financial remuneration was demanded from companies and disguised as support.
In this way, K. Strupas is suspected of having consulted at least five times during public procurement in the field of information technology in Santaros Clinics.
K. Strupas himself denies his guilt.
Professor K. Strupas, suspected of corruption, was dismissed from his position as head of Santaros Clinics in September.
By decision of the Ministry of Health of the stakeholders of Santaros Klinikos and Vilnius University, labour relations with K. Strupas were terminated at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since 10 November 2013.
Santaros Clinics continue to be temporarily led by Professor Juozas Raistenskis until a competition to elect a new CEO takes place and is promised to be announced later this year.

Already wants to teach differently in schools: Promises fewer tests, more practice
Such changes in educational content are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them on Monday at the forum "Development Content Change: Foreign Experience to Solutions in Lithuania" in Vilnius.
Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė, who spoke in the discussion, said that over EUR 30 million has been invested in updating educational content over the last ten years, but no results can be seen.
"According to the results of the international student achievement study PISA, students" achievements are below the average of OECD countries, "said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė.
The OECD expert Phil Lambert, quoted in the report of the Ministry of Education and Science, said that Lithuania is too focused on providing knowledge rather than on the practical application of knowledge.
According to him, general education programmes in Lithuania focus on developing students "literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but it is also needed to develop children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy and empathy.
Presenting changes in the content of general education, Vice-Minister of Education and Science Gražvydas Kazakevičius said that the scope of programmes starting this school year will decrease, they will be more specific and disciplines will be more closely linked to each other.
According to the Vice-Minister, students "education will be more individualized, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare for 10-30% of their unique educational content, the current student assessment system will change to a cumulative score and the student's informally acquired competences will also gain greater weight.
The number of standardised tests will decrease.
It is promised that general education programmes will be digital, user-friendly, linked to e-resources and a task bank.
The aim of updating the content of education is to improve pupils' achievements in the international PISA study by at least 10%, to bridge the gap between pupils' achievements by a third, to equip pupils with modern competences at school and to be literate in various areas.
Lithuania plans to allocate EUR 7.8 million from the European Union and state budget to update the content of education from May 2018.
The draft updated general education programmes are expected to be tested in part of the schools in the school year 2019-2020 and will be launched in all schools from September 2021.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry received criticism for a nearly EUR 8 million project run by the Education Development Centre to update the general programmes of primary, primary and secondary education.
EUR 7.8 million is earmarked for this purpose for four years, and the first purchase worth EUR 1.3 million was announced in early October to look for educators.
After the experts criticized this purchase, it was suspended, the Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskienė dismissed Giedrius Vaidelis, the director of the Education Development Centre.
Lithuania - Exercise on how to respond to extreme flooding
A ten-day exercise to improve the institutions' response to extreme flooding begins in Lithuania on Monday.
As informed by the Fire and Rescue Department (PAGD), the exercise will verify the readiness of public authorities to work in the country in the event of a state-level emergency, such as flooding: To deal with its consequences, to coordinate the search, rescue and rapid eviction of people from flooded areas, to organise their supply of drinking water, food, to ensure the necessary energy supply and to take care of other measures to protect the population.
The exercise will be attended by more than 100 representatives from all ministries, other institutions of the country, as well as members of 12 municipal emergency operations centers.
The preparatory phase of the exercise will take place on 5-13 November, during which municipalities, having received information from the Hydrometeorological Service from the PAD about the continuing rainfall and the beginning of the flood, will take decisions on emergency management.
The active phase of the exercise is planned for 14-15 November.
During it, the State Emergency Operations Centre will operate in the department and institutional emergency operations centres will operate in state and municipal institutions.
Following the government's declaration of a state-level flood emergency, the head of operations appointed by the Prime Minister will lead the response to the emergency, its consequences, and actions to protect and rescue the population and property.
Mindaugas Kanapickas, Deputy Director of PAD, says that the most important thing in the exercise is to check the readiness of the institutions to perform the functions provided for in the legislation, to assess the possibilities to exchange information, to check how they are prepared to warn and inform citizens, state and municipal institutions, bodies and companies about the impending disaster and to "improve the emergency management skills of state institutions."
The exercise will also demonstrate the joint capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian fire-rescuers to pump huge amounts of water from flooded areas.
The BaltFloodCombat module was established in 2009 for this purpose.
Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lucenko resigns
Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lutsenka announced his resignation on Tuesday while speaking in the country's parliament because of the resonance caused by the death of acid-filled anti-corruption activist Katerina Gandziuk, according to Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
According to Ukrainian law, the Prosecutor General must submit a resignation request to the President of the country and he must submit it to the Verkhovna Rada for approval by a majority.
On Tuesday, Attorney General J. Lutsenko presented the course and results of the order of the law enforcement investigation into K. Handziuk's murder at the Supreme Rada.
In a speech to MPs, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed outrage that Mr Gandziuk's death was being exploited for public relations between politicians.
Ms Gandziuk was a Ukrainian activist, a fighter against corruption, who spoke publicly about police corruption in her home city of southern Ukraine, Kherson.
On July 31, an unknown attacker at her home, K. Handziuk, whispered acid in her face.
She died in hospital on 4 November as a result of her injuries.
Protesters under the Ukrainian Ministry of the Interior demand an answer as to who killed K. Handziuk, AFP / Scanpix photo.
According to J. Lutsenkas, the law enforcement investigation figures 12 persons possibly involved in ordering the murder of K. Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the investigation has been leaked to the media, which threatens the success of the investigation.
According to the Attorney General, due to the leaks of information, suspects received essential knowledge for them.
Mr Lutsenko added that he personally knew K. Handziuk and was outraged that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
'so that no one has reason to say that someone is clinging to power, I want to state that I am making a statement to resign.
I will present it to the President of Ukraine today and you will have to discuss this issue in parliament, "Mr Lutsenko's speech in Rada is quoted by the publication Obozrevatel.
It is said that J. Lutsenko added that "he cannot allow double rule in the country when the law enforcement system is disrupted without any evidence, even for the crimes revealed."
Lutsenko is considered a close associate of the country's President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed Attorney General on 12 May 2016 following protracted attempts to remove his predecessor, Victor Shokin, suspected of covering corruption of top officials and politicians, from this post.
Minister of Energy Ž. Vaičiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As advised by Aurelija Vernickaitė, Adviser to the Minister of Energy, the meeting will discuss the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector currently below the trajectories set out in the aggregated National Renewable Energy Action Plans at EU level, with a 6% share of renewable energy in 2015.
The EC estimates that progress towards the binding 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to a number of difficulties, including relatively high costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector comes mainly from biofuels (88%), while electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.
The Seimas took up the proposal to supplement corruption investigation issues with Conservative appeal to the CT
On Tuesday after its presentation, the Seimas approved such a proposal, which was registered by "peasant" Agnė Širinskienė, who is leading the investigation into illegal influence on political processes.
There were 58 members of the Seimas, against - 27, nine members of the Seimas abstained.
The project will continue to be discussed by the committees of the Seimas, the main appointed Committee on Law and Order chaired by A. Širinskienė.
Following its conclusion, the adoption of the amendment to the resolution will be put to the vote.
The Seimas Interim Commission, which is currently conducting a new investigation into political corruption, has been instructed to investigate possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
A. Širinskienė proposed to extend this term by stating that "significant information has appeared in the public domain about possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and state institutions."
A. Širinskienė identifies in the project "possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or by applying to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of significant independent institutions such as the Chief Official Ethics Commission."
The appeal to the Constitutional Court for pensions was initiated by opposition conservatives.
The ruling "peasants" found out that the conservatives relied largely on arguments from private pension fund lawyers in their appeal.
With the impact on the Chief Official Ethics Commission (CSTEE), the leaders of "peasants" accuse former comrade Povilas Urbšis.
According to them, the former chairman of the Seimas Committee on State Administration and Local Authorities could order VTEK members to dismiss Mindaugas Siauris, former head of the commission's prevention department.
At the end of September the Seimas formed a commission to explain the possible illegal influence of interested persons or groups, the impact on the course of the elections, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary groups, individual politicians, the activities and funding of parties and social movements, legislative processes, the election of members of state-owned enterprises, heads of public bodies, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to look into what information law enforcement and intelligence authorities have provided to the competent authorities and how they have responded to it.
The researchers are expected to present their findings by 1 May of the following year.
At that time, there will be an election campaign for the President, the European Parliament.
Of the 12 members of the commission, seven are representatives of "peasants."
Two social workers were also appointed as its members, one "creature," a liberal and a representative of the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania - Christian Families Union.
The Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to participate in the commission's work.
The new investigation was initiated by Ramūnas Karbauskis, chairman of the ruling Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union.
According to him, the investigation by the National Security and Defence Committee (NPCC) last session, mainly on the same subjects, showed that the investigation needs to continue.
Head of German Internal Intelligence lost his post
The 55-year-old H. G. Maassen further fuelled the control by stating that "radical left forces" in Merkel's coalition were to blame for his troubles.
As a result, he was not moved to another post, as promised earlier, but forced to go to reserve.
Among other things, it became clear last weekend that, at a meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence organisations in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Mr Maassen criticised Mrs Merkel's'naive'immigration policy.
Horst Seehofer, the German interior minister who has long defended the intelligence chief, stated at a press conference on Monday that Mr Maassen's recent comments were unacceptable and "disappointed him personally."
Mr Seehofer, himself under pressure from both this dispute and the poor performance of his party in the Bavarian local government elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to put H. G. Maassen in reserve.

Plump girls destroy stereotypes about wedding dresses
A plump girl with a white fluffy bride's dress - a mission (not) possible?
Can a white swan flying towards the altar be larger than the size of S or M and still look attractive?
Participants of the plus-size reality show "Size (r) evolution" will prove already today that the beauty and elegance of the bride really does not depend on a woman's kilograms.
But that's not all - one of the project girls will be filled with tears of happiness this evening - her boyfriend will appear on the filming court.
"There are still those who think that bigger girls do not get the attention or glimpses of guys.
This is just a myth - my boyfriend himself is an athlete, but I like him as I am, he does not require some standard figure from me, "- show participant Aurika will speak before the performance with the wedding dress.
The wedding dress is not easy, in every sense, the garment - it is a complex construction, it is rich in material, the dress is heavy and uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women think that a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less self-confident.
I can assure you that a properly chosen dress model really solves this "problem," "explained one of the show's commissioners, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
The fate of the girls in the project is decided by R. Kalinkinas together with the entire commission - Erika Vitulskienė who opened a plus-size fashion house, photographer and social networking star Naglis Bierancas and TV producer Laura Paukštas.
"When deciding which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there are many quarrels between the members of the commission - after all, we all represent different spheres and imagine the winner of the show differently.
The task of demonstrating wedding dresses has been made even more difficult by the fact - and I can now reveal - that two newcomers have appeared who were certainly not worse than the old ones.
It was a special evening in every sense, "- says R. Kalinkinas.
Newcomers - Eve, who became famous for her scandalous behaviour in one summer reality show in 23, and Dovilė, a 31-year-old mother of two children of exceptional beauty - like other girls participated in the selection of "Size (r) evolution" and were in the top 20.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo session of the girls in the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
LNK viewers returned the girls to the show, who voted for their favorites on the television portal.
Having received international recognition, the plump beauty reality show has been taking place in Lithuania for the second week - here plus-size girls are competing for the name of the first plus-size star in the country.
So far, there are only eight of them left - and they are all well aware that the winner will only be able to be one.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show "Size (r) evolution" starts this Monday evening at 20.30 via LNK.
Actor I. Elba elected the sexiest man in the world
Us magazine People has published this year's sexiest man in the world.
It was made by 46-year-old British actor Idriss Elba.
Although the man claims this message was unexpected, he was not short of witty when telling us about the new title.
I thought "Can't be!
Seriously? '.
Then I looked myself in the mirror and thought - yes, I look sexy today - the actor shared his laugh.
Speaking openly, Idriss pointed out that this title, it's a particularly pleasing feeling that has caught his ego.
The British star claims to have often received abusive words and bullying, which made his childhood uneasy because, as he himself points out, he was "very tall and clumsy."
The young actor did not convince his peers and became an object of bullying also because of his rare and unusual name and his African background.
"As soon as I grew my mustache and muscle I became the toughest guy in my city district," smiles Idriss.
When a man does not have to be on the big screens, I. Elba works as a discoverer at parties held in Spain and especially in bustling Ibiza.
During his spare time, a man enjoys Thai boxing and has a vein for fashion that he realises by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor argues that the family is most important to him in the world, so he is planning a wedding with his fiancé Sabrina Dhowre.
I. Elba became the 33rd most sexy man in the world elected by People magazine.
Blake Shelton had the title in 2017.

According to the Vilnius County Police, a report was received at 21.16 that a man had beaten a neighbor during a binge.
When the doctors arrived, they stated the death of a man born in 1943.
The suspect, who was born in 1994 and had 2.53 prom. drunkenness, was arrested.

Those in power no longer require a distance of 20 km for the construction of waste-to-energy power plants
Vilnius combined heat and power plant is being built near the Gariūnai market.
The ruling parties no longer want the construction of waste-to-energy power plants to maintain a distance of 20 kilometres from the settlements.
On Monday, Kęstutis Mažeika, the head of the Environment Committee, registered an amendment to the Waste Management Act with the Seimas, which refuses such a requirement.
According to Mr. Mažeika, the "peasant" group, which previously supported the provision of a distance of 20 km, promises to support the amendment on its refusal.
Mr Mažeika's amendment provides that waste incineration plants could be built with statutory environmental and public health requirements from January 2019.
He admits that the amendments were prompted by the President's doubts about such a ban.
"Given the definition of the territory of residence, it is clear that it would be almost impossible to find a place where the above objects could be built," the chairman of the committee says.
The ruling majority opposed amendments to the President's veto in October that tighten up the construction of waste-to-energy power plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste-to-energy power plants less than 20 km from settlements, the amendments allowed the government to take decisions on the future of the two power plants already under construction, taking into account public health interests.
Mr. Mažeika does not propose to adjust the latter provision.
The power plant fired with waste and biofuels is being built in Vilnius by the energy group Lietuvos energija and in Kaunas together with Fortum Heat Lietuva, a company of the Finnish energy concern Fortum.

The British and Irish leaders discussed a possible compromise on Monday on the difficult issue of Northern Ireland, which is stalling Brexit negotiations, Dublin reported.
Speaking by phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered the opportunity to review the so-called safeguard arrangement mechanism, which would make it possible to leave an open border between the province of Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland in the European Union.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar promised to consider this proposal but rejected any possibility of Britain unilaterally withdrawing from the agreement, according to a report published by the Irish government.
In the conversation, Th. May "raised the possibility of reviewing the backstop mechanism," it points out.
"Varadkar made it clear that he is open to reviewing the new proposals, provided that the result of such a review is not linked to a unilateral decision to terminate the hedging measures," the government report said.
Brexit negotiators do not find an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland land border when Britain leaves the single market and customs union in March next year.
Both sides agree on "hedging measures" to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger-scale trade agreement is signed to ensure that no additional customs checks are carried out at the border.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be temporarily applied to the whole of the United Kingdom.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is pushing for Britain to be able to withdraw from the backstop agreement unilaterally in three months' time.
However, Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support this."
"Hedging measures of three months or a limited time are not worth the paper on which they will be written," he stated.
Earlier, London and Brussels did not confirm information about the breakthrough in the Brexit talks following a report in Britain at the weekend that an agreement was within reach.
"I would say that we continue to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to do," said Th. May's representative in London.
Margaritis Schinas, a representative of the European Commission, also told journalists: 'We are not there yet'.
Nobel laureates call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, issued a declaration on Monday calling for the right to reliable information in the online era.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Sen (Amartja Old) and Joseph Stiglitz (Joseph Stiglitz), Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Shirin Ebadi), as well as Nobel Prize winner writer Mario Vargas Vargosa (Masa).
"We call on goodwill leaders on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debate in which citizens can make decisions on the basis of facts," the group's report said.
They argue that a "global information and communication space" is a common good that "must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion."
"People have a fundamental right to information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated, based on the principles of commitment to truth, plurality of approaches and rational methods of fact-finding," the authors of the declaration added.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who often criticizes "fake news" but is regularly accused of distorting facts.
World leaders should express their position on this issue when they gather for the Peace Forum in Paris on 11-13 November, the signatories urged.
This declaration was drawn up within two months under the leadership of Mr Ebadi and Christophe Deloire (Kristof Deluar), head of Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a media freedom and protection organisation based in Paris.
Other signatories include former Senegal President Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama (Frensis Fukuyama).
Seimas approves higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Product Safety Act providing that penalties for product safety breaches should be increased.
The amendments were adopted unanimously in the Chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health Affairs, said, with regard to the new project, it is to be welcomed that the stated objectives relate to better consumer protection of products.
It also aligns its provisions with the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"In my opinion, the proposed draft law distributes more perfectly and specifically between all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: Manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further infringements as entities continue to commit repeated infringements after paying fines, "said A. Vinkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy and after approval by the Government, the Economic Committee of the Seimas supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim to increase penalties for infringements, strengthen the protection of consumer rights, empower market surveillance authorities and establish a clear framework for product safety requirements and enforcement.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for manufacturers to properly label a product to ensure its traceability.
Moreover, according to the ministry, market surveillance authorities do not have the right to enter the territory of manufacturers and suppliers, buildings, premises and to carry out inspections, which complicates the work of the authorities.
The ministry considers that the six-month deadline for imposing fines and warnings is too short to detect an infringement, carry out an investigation and impose a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the fines imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the law - 14 companies did so in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Economy proposed to introduce an obligation for manufacturers to properly label a product in order to ensure its traceability in order to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to clarify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the right, in the context of public product safety controls, to enter the territory, buildings and premises of operators who manufacture, place products on the market and to carry out inspections.
The intention is to increase the level of fines for violations of the law.
A manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who placed dangerous products on the market and a distributor who supplied them to the market, a service provider providing dangerous services or providing them would be fined between €150 and €2,500 (currently between €144 and €1,448).
If the Public Consumer Rights Protection Authority (CPB) or other market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing on the market and placing on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, a fine of between €1,000 and €5,000 (currently between €868 and €4,344) would be imposed.
Failure to comply with the requirement to withdraw dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of between €2,500 and €6,500 (now between €1,448 and €5,792).
If dangerous products caused harm to the health of the consumer, a fine of between €2,500 and €15,000 (now between €1,448 and €11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of the consumer, a fine of between €6,500 and €25,000 (now between €5,792 and €23,169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria a violation of product safety legislation is subject to a fine of up to EUR 25 000 (no minimum amount of the fine), in Belgium a fine of between EUR 26 and EUR 600 000, in Romania a fine of between EUR 155 and EUR 6 666 and in Bulgaria a fine of between EUR 125 and EUR 7 500.

Norwegian armed battalion took part in NATO exercises in the most remote and northernmost areas
Soldiers from the Norwegian armed forces took part in a series of difficult exercises in the mountains north of Oslo, the country's capital.
This is part of NATO's exercise "three-pronged Link 2018," the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most soldiers from the second Norwegian military battalion spent a lot of time away from home after the September 11 terrorist attacks, in places such as Afghanistan - that is, in warm countries.
But most of all, they are skilled at war in the Arctic, and these skills are particularly useful now that NATO is changing the direction of its attention.
In recent days, troops have been involved in staged battles against real British soldiers in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the most remote and northernmost areas.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold in the wild, but in a harsh climate they have to pull much greater weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Troops staying in the command post say they share their skills on how to survive and fight in such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the soldiers, this exercise, which is very reminiscent of real warfare like no other, will teach them to be ready if there is a serious threat.

He said he also did not plan to participate in the next municipal elections.
P. Mačiulis has not yet had the opportunity to talk to V. Ušackas after he lost the primary elections of the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union to ingrida Šimonytė on Sunday.
"To be honest, we have not yet been able to discuss the results with him and the team in detail and talk about future plans.
It is obvious that when Vygaudas withdraws from further election fight, this stage of my life is completed, "said P. Mačiulis.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas policy because of support for V. Ušackas, but regretted that "Lithuania has lost a unique opportunity to have a real leader in the context of international relations."

Workers are crushing in Kaunas castle: What are they doing here?
When the residents of Kaunas noticed the workers crushing in Kaunas Castle, they hoped that the reconstruction of the remaining tower was finally under way.
Gabrielius Sužiedėlis, the director of Kaunas City Museum, assured the portal kauno.diena.lt that works are taking place here to replace the coating of protective roofs of the southwest tower with a fragment of the defensive wall.
According to the interviewer, the roofs will be cans.
"The worn-out tin coating in an emergency condition was a threat to those around them - people could fall in and injure themselves - so it was necessary to replace it.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so heritage was also damaged, "explained the director of the museum.
Will these roofs be similar to those a few centuries ago?
"All works are coordinated with heritage and other institutions," G. Sužeidėlis added those who want the result to be as authentic as possible, but at the same time the practical side is important - the roofs must protect the values from moisture.
When working with heritage, a universal solution was chosen.
Before that, the elements of Kaunas castle were covered with the tin during the Soviet era, so they no longer had historical value, "- detailed the director of Kaunas City Museum.
The works contract was signed on 2 October.
It is planned that the works will not take more than three months after the signing of the contract.
"It is expected that it will be completed by the end of November," the director of the museum taught his expectations.
According to him, the value of the works performed amounts to almost 24 thousand Eur.
This amount, according to the interviewer, was provided for in this year's budget.
The works in Kaunas Castle are carried out by the company "Statija."
Kauno. diena.lt has written how, according to the studies carried out, Kaunas castle could have seemed earlier.

Eastern Europe Studies Centre to collaborate with two famous US "brain centres"
According to Linas Kojala, the head of the EESC, who is based in Vilnius and has been counting for the thirteenth year of operation, networking in the USA will allow the implementation of projects and make Lithuania's voice more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that two large institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that there will be niches for activities, because the topics of NATO, security, misinformation and development of Eastern Partnership countries we analyse are also a priority for them, "Kojala said.
The agreements note that EESC and US institutions will work together in preparing applications for international projects, exchange expert experience and knowledge, and organise expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have an excellent international reputation.
The FPRI has been operating since 1955 and brings together almost a hundred top-level analysts.
In the latest global ranking of analytical centres by the University of Pennsylvania, FPRI was ranked seventh in its category.
At that time, CEPA, whose analysts have repeatedly been invited to advise and work in the top US political institutions, is going tenth in its category in the same ranking.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to enter the US information space and encourage us to raise the quality bar up," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be to help partners in the distribution of the upcoming EESC analytical publication Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review among US decision-makers and in the public sphere.
The Eastern Europe Studies Centre operates on the basis of implemented projects and is not maintained by targeted grants.
EESC partners with whom joint initiatives are implemented include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.

He was a military intelligence officer at the Joint Force Headquarters but was due to return to work as mayor in January.
Another member of the US army, whose name is not yet being made public, was injured in the attack on Saturday, which claimed Mr Taylor's life.
According to officials, Mr Taylor died as a result of the infantry weapons fire.
Commander of the Utah National Guard Major General Jefferson S. Burton told journalists that B. Taylor helped train and strengthen the capabilities of the Afghan National Army.
Utah media quoted a NATO report that Mr Taylor had been shot by one of the trained special forces and that the attacker had been shot by Afghan forces.
