MG Baltic case: Gustainis's new lawyer says he has not yet got acquainted with the material of the case
The eleventh hearing of the MG Baltic case on Monday was attended by all the defendants: Šarūnas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The trial began with the testimony of the defendants.
At the last court hearing, the state-appointed new lawyer of Mr. Gustaini, Aleksandr Dorošev, told the panel of judges that he had not yet been able to access the material of the case.
At the time, Linas Belevičius, the lawyer of MG Baltic, stated that in order to ensure a full personal defence, the panel of judges must allow the new lawyer to familiarize himself with the material of the case and asked for the hearing to be adjourned.
"In order to ensure a person's defence, he must familiarize himself with the material of the criminal case.
This is not just a formal sitting, "said L. Belevičius.
The new lawyer, A. Doroshev, noted that he had not been able to familiarize himself with either the indictment or all the material in the case.
At the previous court hearing, the suspect, Šarūnas Gustainis, announced that he had refused his lawyer because he could no longer pay him.
The hearing was also attended by audio recordings.
Advocates of the accused were outraged that the audio recordings submitted to the court were of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that politicians, taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated decisions favorable to the concern in the Seimas and other state institutions, as well as had an impact on determining the winners of public procurement, recalls ELTA.
During the pre-trial investigation, more than 150 people were interviewed, of which more than 50 were members of the previous and current parliamentary term, several former ministers and members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 surveys and more than 30 searches have been carried out.
It is suspected that Šarūnas Gustainis received a bribe of more than 8 thousand euros, G. Steponavičius - 15 thousand euros, V. Gapšys - more than 27 thousand. E. Masiulis is suspected of taking a bribe of more than 106 thousand euros.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trafficking, the Liberal Movement is suspected of bribery, trafficking and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of bribing and trading these parties.
It is suspected that politicians consulted with R. Kurlianskis, the vice president of MG Baltic, on bribes, and later offered or supported initiatives favorable to the concern in the Seimas or other institutions.
Ethics watchdogs: The Board of the Liberal Movement is right about the actions of the Vilnius chapter
"The decisions taken by the Board are in accordance with the statutes," its head Vytautas Tamošiūnas told BNS after the meeting of the commission.
"Our decision was not something new.
We had already made an explanation as a commission in July, when the question of Pagėgiai and Utena was raised.
We said at the time that, according to the statutes, this is a matter of competence for the Board.
And if the Board decides that some department can act as it wishes - to go with the committee and the Board approves it, then the department can go, but if the Board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the Board has adopted, then there is a decision for all departments to form party lists.
And if you don't agree with the board, then there is a possibility to suspend membership and go with the committee, "he added.
According to V. Tamošiūnas, the party board will now decide on further actions.
On October 17, the Board of the Liberal Movement of the Party annulled the decision of the Vilnius City Division to participate in municipal elections not with the list of the party, but with the list of the newly elected election committee.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the Liberals of the capital to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's statutes and the decisions of the board.
By October 31, the Vilnius chapter had to cancel its aspirations to participate in municipal elections with a committee list.
But the department did not do so.
The former head of the department, parliamentarian Aušrinė Armonaitė, has already withdrawn from the Liberal Movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, former chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus Šimašius, promising to seek another term as leader of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the Public Election Committee "For Vilnius, which we are proud of!"
He has also left the party.
Elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place in March next year.
Residents of a village in northern India drove a tiger with a tractor that had previously torn down one man, officials said on Monday.
Forest maintenance officer Mahaviras Kaujlagi said that after the tiger was torn down late on Sunday by a man who worked in the fields, the villagers surrounded the beast and drove it with a tractor when the female tried to escape.
Residents say the tiger also attacked and tore one young man about 10 days ago.
The village in question is located in the Dudhva Tiger Reserve in Lakhympur Kher district, about 250 km southeast of Laknau, the capital of Uttar Pradesh state.
It is forbidden to kill tigers in protected areas.
Ramesh Pandey, the director of the ban, said that under the Wildlife Protection Act, the case would be reported to the police.
In April, villagers in the Nghasan district of Uttar Pradesh state killed another tiger, who suffered serious injuries.
Tiger is an Indian national animal; under the Wildlife Protection Act, tigers are considered an endangered species.
Government figures from last year show that in the past three years, at least one person has died every day in collisions with wild tigers or elephants.
Human conflicts with tigers have been gradually increasing since the 1970s, when India launched a tiger protection programme, which established reserves in national parks and criminalised the galloping of big cats.
Although the methods of counting tigers have changed, the censuses would show that the population of about 1,800 tigers at the time increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
It is proposed that cats and dogs should be labelled with microchips
Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, together with other members of the Seimas, has registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, which propose mandatory labelling of cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be labelled with subcutaneous microchips, and their registration and labelling should be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be labelled free of charge with state funds, and in 2020 - cats as well, so the residents will not be concerned and the costs will be covered by specially provided state funding, "said Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.
The amendments to the law aim to address the systemic need for labelling of domestic animals.
It is hoped that this will help to avoid the problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal propagators or sellers.
It is estimated that, according to the expected average cost of the microchip and service provision, which will amount to about 5 euros, all animal owners will be reimbursed during the transitional period.
The total cost of labelling for all pets can be up to €6 million.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be distributed over three years and will amount to €2 million each year.
It is expected that funds for labelling programmes will be allocated through the Special Programme for the Protection of the Environment of the Municipalities, whose income will increase significantly this year due to increased taxes on natural resources and the redistribution of funds.
The municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for cat and dog labelling, but also for castration and other programmes.
According to K. Mažeika, the practice of mandatory labelling is common in almost all countries of the European Union, which allows the protection of the animals themselves (because the lost ones can easily be returned to the owners), and saves the time of the pet owners themselves, when the search for a escaped and lost pet has to be spent a lot of time and money.
In addition, EU legislation stipulates that only marked pets can travel.
At the same time, labelling obliges you to take care of an animal in a responsible manner throughout its life.
Previous proposals for mandatory labelling have met with resistance, as the relevant programmes have been proposed to be funded by the population.
"The current model should avoid this criticism, because animal protection is proposed to be financed by increased income in the environmental support programme and by giving the right to labelling not only to veterinarians, but also to the public, i.e. to people in animal care institutions who have listened to special courses at the Veterinary Academy," says the authors of the project.
The draft law was registered by a group of members of the Seimas representing different parliamentary groups - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 members of government forces killed in Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
A spokesman for the provincial governor, Arif Noori, said seven soldiers and six police officers had been killed.
He added that four more soldiers were injured during the attack at a joint army and police checkpoint in the Chogjani district.
According to Noori, during the three-hour battle with Afghan forces, six fighters were killed and another ten Taliban were wounded.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement to the media in which the movement assumed responsibility for Monday's attack in Gazni province.
Mr Noori said the post was installed two days ago in a strategically important area to cut off the Taliban's supply route.
The post was completely destroyed during the attack.
"Rytas" extended a helping hand to the Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the FIBA European Cup fourth round match will take place in Vilnius Rytas Arena, where clubs from Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
The duel will be held in the capital for political reasons.
Vilnius "Rytas," which maintains a warm relationship with Ukrainian basketball, will accept Cherkaski Mavpy and Pristina "KB Prishtina" teams under its roof at "Ryto" Arena on November 7th.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine we were not able to hold this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to accept us," - Maksim Michelson, the head coach of the Ukrainian team, thanked "Rytas."
- We have many friends in Vilnius, and our countries always agree well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the best basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honour for us to play here.
We hope that we will receive support from the citizens of Vilnius.
The Kosovo team was unable to come to Ukraine because these countries do not have any diplomatic relations.
Currently, the Ukrainian team takes third place after the first round with one victory in three meetings, while the Kosovo team is in second position and has more wins.
This will be a very important challenge for Group E, as only two teams will enter the next round.
In the past, the matches of the Ukrainian and Kosovo national teams in the selection for the 2017 European Basketball Championship took place in Vilnius.
Then the Ukrainian team celebrated the victory 100: 61.
Basketball fans will be able to enter the match free of charge on Wednesday, and the start of the duel is 19: 00.
"Women lie better" star actress B. Arsobaite is persecuted by liars
It is probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown actress Brigita Arsobaitė has been receiving roles related to liars for several times.
First the series "Women lie better," then the performance "Melagės" and finally the comedy "Melagiai."
In this film Brigita plays the square wife of the hero of Dainius Kazlauskas.
"I really liked to film in" Melagiai, "because I am more a theatre actress and I rarely appeared in cinema.
A wonderful team of colleagues from the very beginning promised an excellent result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
However, the most interesting thing that happened on the pitch was puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would certainly be big and serious.
I have never admired those small, decorative "fiff" quadcopters.
However, during the filming, Sunny was so attached to me that the fondness became mutual and eventually I even wanted to buy it from the host, but unsuccessfully, "- smiles the actress.
From the first minutes, a new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai," produced by Paulius Virbickas, producer of Lithuanian film hits "Inexperienced" and "Between Us, Boys," and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionovas, turns into comical and intriguing perimeters of family members.
Your beloved has just announced that she is waiting.
It would be great news, just... your beloved is your brother's wife!
But that is not all.
After failing to publish'good news' to everyone, the parents suddenly declare - they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this takes place just before the most beautiful holidays of the year - Christmas!
But the end will surprise even more, because no one expected such an atomic bomb.
All the heroes are not what they looked like at first sight...
In addition to B. Arsobaite's comedy "Melagiai," four generations of film stars will present a good mood to the audience: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Lubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
Comedian "Melagiai" - in cinema from November 9.
Judging whether to write off €100 million in unpaid taxes for emigrants
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted an amendment to the Law on the Declaration of Residence drafted by Ramūnas Karbauskis, the leader of the "peasants."
56 members of the Seimas voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstentions.
The Seimas will then take the reading of the amendments on 6 December or later, after receiving the Government's conclusion.
According to R. Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarian, within three years one person does not pay about 1 thousand euros, and now there are about 100 thousand such persons.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas regretted that in this way the Seimas would "urge some people not to comply with their obligations" - to declare their departure and then no taxes would be calculated.
Conservative Antanas Matulas, a member of the Committee on Health Affairs, noted that Lithuanians living abroad use the fact that when they pay a small health insurance fee, they come to Lithuania for treatment - they are provided with the same services as those who pay this tax.
The amendments provide that those who have left Lithuania would be considered to be those who will pay social security contributions in the countries of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, while Sodra will have exempted them from the payment of health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevičius, the head of "Sodra," has previously said that such a step will facilitate the lives of both emigrating people and the activities of "Sodra."
A video posted online about a sliding teddy bear reveals a serious problem
It is filmed as the mother bear climbs on a steep snowy slope, and the little one climbs, slips down and climbs again.
The video received a lot of views and comments.
People admired the tenacity of the little bear - after repeatedly slipping down, he would climb back to his mother.
He succeeds not at the first time, but the little one does not try to give up and finally reaches his goal.
The video does indeed attract attention, but it also reveals the threat posed by humans to animals.
Scientists say that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people's desire to know the wild can sometimes be harmful.
"It is obvious to me that the bears were very frightened by the drone.
Their movements show that they are panicking.
If the drone were not flying around, they would probably have chosen a safer path or overcome it more slowly or cautiously.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used, "ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago, Mr Ditmer and his colleagues studied how drones affect bears.
The animals were fitted with heart work gauges.
When the drone approached, some of the bears would run away, others would not run anywhere, but all their hearts would start beating more often from the fright.
Scientists advise the use of drones to film animals responsibly, not to fly too close, not to make noise and not to fly where it is prohibited.
The escaped president was approached by a newspaper
A Kiev court on Tuesday invited deposed President Viktor Yanukovych, who has left for Russia, to attend a hearing on his alleged state betrayal in an unusual way, the state's official publication reported.
In a court summons published in the government news newspaper Uriadovoj kurjer, the former leader is invited to attend a criminal proceedings hearing on 19 November, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that Yanukovych has the right to attend the meeting via video link.
On 30 October, the Kiev court announced that it had completed the debate in the case of Yanukovych.
Yanukovych's lawyer, Aleksandr Goroshinski, who works in Russia, was given the opportunity to register in the register of foreign lawyers by 19 November so that he could attend a hearing where Yanukovych is expected to speak his last word via video link.
Yanukovych, supported by the Kremlin, was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the president's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader had been taken to Russia during a special operation organised by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula, which belongs to Ukraine, and a little later a war broke out in the east of the country between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists.
Since then, the fighting has claimed the lives of about 10,000 people, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a lasting ceasefire.
The list of Conservatives will be led by Valdas Benkunskas to Vilnius City Council
Dainius Kreivys, a former Minister of Economy and parliamentarian, has already been confirmed as a Conservative candidate for the year.
Over the weekend, during the Conservative primary elections, party members ranked the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Municipality Council.
According to the party, V. Benkunskas, the chairman of the Vilnius chapter of the TS-LKD, became the leader of the Conservative list.
In the first ten of the candidates were members of Vilnius City Municipality Council Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adomas Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Baškienė, former member of the Seimas Liutauras Kazlavickas, Chairman of the Young Conservative League Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karazijaitė.
Direct elections for mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on 3 March next year.
Restrictions on cogeneration power plants are appealed to the Constitutional Court
The opposition of the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (CT) the decision of the ruling parties to adopt a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition group of the Seimas Homeland Union and Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) reported that a group of members of the Seimas appealed to the CT to investigate the compliance of the amendments to the Waste Management Act adopted by the ruling parties with the Constitution.
"The MPs stress that the provisions of the law aim to question the current projects of waste incineration plants by instructing the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km distance from the residential area) before the entry into force of the law on waste incineration plants started in Vilnius and Kaunas," the report reads.
"The Members note that, taking into account how the law formulates a ban on the construction of objects of national importance for waste management (i.e. the distance is determined and the concept of" residential area "is defined), it should be concluded that this ban disproportionately restricts or even denies the essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for energy production, since the established criteria are formulated in such a way that, after assessing the density and distribution of the Lithuanian population in the country, it would be practically impossible to build such objects in the entire territory of the country," it adds.
The appeal states that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The CT has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and consequences that have occurred before the entry into force of the newly adopted legislation.
In this case, the government is given the power to apply the law back on the basis of an undefined criterion.
Such legal regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security and the protection of legitimate expectations, and therefore the constitutional principle of the rule of law, "the appeal states.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in the projects of cogeneration power plants in Vilnius and Kaunas.
The suspension of the current projects would not only cause hundreds of millions of financial losses to the state, but would also cause huge losses to the Lithuanian population - heating prices would increase and environmental pollution would increase as a result of the growing amount of waste disposal in landfills.
The appeal to the CT was signed by Algirdas Butkevičius, Deputy Elder of the Seimas TS-LKD, Liberal Movement, Social Democratic Groups and the ruling Social Democratic Labour Group.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to collect 71 votes by the ruling parties to reject the veto of President Dalia Grybauskaitė on amendments to the Waste Management Act, which stipulate the right of the Government to suspend the construction of cogeneration power plants already started, and also established a "quarantine" zone of 20 km from residential areas for the construction of such power plants.
The amendments to the law readopted by the Seimas will enter into force from 1 January 2019. However, the ruling parties are already proposing to waive the 20 km limit.
This proposal is scheduled to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the government's right to suspend projects that have already been started is not planned.
The CT will examine this case in a row, no earlier than a year later.
He made public the alarming statistics of LeBron James at the Lakers club
The start of LeBron James' career at the Los Angeles Lakers is not what he himself, the organization and basketball fans expected.
The Lakers started the season with four victories and six defeats, and such a weak start helped spark rumours of a possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
However, such talk was reassured by the president of basketball operations, Magic Johnson, who said he would not forgive the coach, but that he needed to play better.
L. James, the team's biggest star, should also look at himself.
Although the striker's stats are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 assists.
However, it does not tell the whole truth.
In the first ten games of the season, other figures have also emerged, showing that the Lakers are playing better when James is not on the pitch.
+ / - statistics showing how many more points are scored or missed by a team when certain players are on the pitch.
That's when James is on the pitch, the Lakers have spent 30 points more this season than their rivals.
As he sat on the bench, the "lakes" earned 19 points more than their rivals.
At the moment, the Lakers are only in 13th place in the Western Conference, but a few victories can turn everything around.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian airspace in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania very much appreciates Spain's cooperation in NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and region," Minister Linkevičius said.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out NATO air police and air police strengthening missions in the Baltic States five times, including three times in Lithuania.
The last time Spanish Eurofighter fighter jets were deployed in Šiauliai in May-August of this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian airspace in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations on security, political, economic and strategic communication in the fight against propaganda are taking place between Lithuania and Spain.
L.Linkevičius expressed his hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to work closely together on the European, transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga is the fifth representative of Spain in Lithuania.
On October 29, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented the letters to President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
V. Ačienė on the detention of R. Ačas: I believe in her husband's innocence and law enforcement
"For me, this was the most unexpected thing I could never think about.
On the other hand, the services are probably doing the work they are obliged to do.
Everyone is doing their job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband, that everything is right and fair, that no unfair actions should be done by him, "V. Ačienė told BNS.
R. Ačas was detained by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday - law enforcement suspects that he, while still being the director of the administration of Raseiniai Municipality, took a high-value bribe and in exchange could create exclusive conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the municipal Raseiniai Bus Park.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly bribing Mr Acha or of being involved in concealing bribes in various financial transactions.
In April of this year, the Raseiniai District Municipal Council dismissed R. Ačas from the position of head of administration in a third attempt after expressed mistrust.
The former "bandleader" became a member of the newly established Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminas Kirchner in March this year, and he suspended his membership of the party on Monday.
A few years ago, R. Ačas unsuccessfully candidate in the mayor's elections as a representative of the election committee "Thy Raseiniai."
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to raise his candidacy in the elections of the mayor of Raseiniai next year, but had not yet decided whether he would not participate in the elections of municipal councils.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas with the list of the Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union and is a member of the Anti-Corruption Commission of the Seimas.
The politician says she is waiting for further law enforcement action, which will depend on her removal from her job at the commission.
"I really do not make any sudden decisions today, I think I will make a decision this week.
I will see, if there is a need, what charges have been brought, that I will, of course, take one or another decision.
I probably need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again, it will put everything in my place, "she said.
Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, the representative of the opposition conservatives in the Seimas, called on the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Pranckienė and the Head of the "peasants" Ramūnas Karbauskis to dissociate themselves from the statements of the group's colleague Vida Ačienė and to withdraw her from the Anti-Corruption Commission of the Seimas by transferring her to another Seimas committee or commission.
She states that the further work of V. Ačienė in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission "would cause public mistrust and discredit the work of an important parliamentary oversight commission."
Sensitive music of "Coldplay" also attracted famous Lithuanian couples
On a autumn Monday evening, many music and film lovers gathered for the premiere of the film "Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams."
A whole group of famous people came to the event: Jonas and Simona Nainiai, Ignas Lelys, Martynas Tyla and many others.
The film tells the story of Coldplay, one of the most popular pop groups in Britain, which intertwines with moments from the concerts.
Documentary director Matas Whitecross got acquainted with the guys of the group even when they still played in bars and collected only a few dozen spectators.
In the film you can see shots from the backstage of concerts, rehearsals or leisure.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met at college in 1996 and founded Pectoralz.
Soon they were joined by bassist Guy Berryman, and a little later by drummer Will Champion.
The band changed its name to Coldplay and exactly twenty years ago released their first record "Safety," which included three tracks.
Of the 500 copies of the record, most were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, and only 50 copies of "Safety" were sold.
Now Coldplay is a world-famous, respected and beloved group that has released seven albums with more than 100 million copies sold.
Over two decades, the band has won 107 various awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.

Grybauskaitė calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for European Union (EU) countries and to facilitate foreign imports.
At the opening of the Trade and Investment Forum at the Chinese import exhibition in Shanghai, Dalia Grybauskaitė stressed that in view of the signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to "join efforts to stop the spread of protectionism in the world," addressing the root causes of the tensions caused by trade wars, "overproduction and unfair competition."
"The European Union attaches great importance to China's commitment to creating a more attractive, open environment for investment, which is important when negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business feels welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property, "said Dalia Grybauskaitė.
According to her, China's opening is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The Lithuanian leader stressed that transparency of investments must be "above the interests of any business group."
"Transparency, the rule of law, strict compliance with international agreements - this must be essential for the environment of new investment relations," stressed Dalia Grybauskaitė.
"Corrupt capital flows should not be welcome in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China is trying to soften criticism that it is avoiding opening up its market and only protecting its own companies.
The exhibition is attended by leaders of several countries, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the data of the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, China currently ranks 25th among its export partners.
Last year, Lithuanian exports to China grew by 50 percent, which amounted to EUR 180 million.
At the same time, imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials are concerned that Chinese investment in Lithuania could bring undesirable political influence, and Beijing's exclusive focus on Eastern Europe is splitting the unity of the EU.

The cause of the Lion Air plane crash revealed: relatives of those who died are angry
The black box of the crashed Indonesian airline Lion Air liner shows that at least four of its last flights have been affected by a speed gauge failure, investigators reported on Monday.
Soerjanto Tjahjon, chairman of the National Transport Safety Committee (NTSK), said a similar incident occurred during the last four flights of the plane, including the fatal one, when the liner fell in the Java Sea on October 29 shortly after take-off from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board were killed in this disaster.
Many media reported problems during the previous Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box, yes, the real technical problem was the speed in the air, in other words the speed of the plane," Mr Tjahjon said at a press conference.
"The black box data showed that there was also the same problem during the two flights before the trip to Denpasara-Jakarta," he added.
"There are many rumours circulating on social media.
We now want to explain that in the black box (the data remained) about four flights during which there were problems with the air speed gauge, "the head of the NTSK said.
During a meeting with members of the families of the dead, Mr Tjahjon said the information from the flight data recording device was in line with reports that the speed and height of the last flight had changed in a disorderly manner.
Search teams have not yet found a second black box recording conversations in the pilot's cab.
Lion Air said it had been repaired after a technical fault was detected on a flight from Bali to Jakarta, according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the company's founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to Transport Minister Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated a meeting of family members with officials overseeing the search for the remains of the plane and the victims and the investigation into the crash.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Mr Kirana, who founded Lion Air together with his brother Kusnan in 1999, present himself.
"Lion Air did not behave properly," said one man, who identified himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island where the plane was flying.
"I want Mr Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he said.
"Lion Air has never contacted me since the beginning of the crisis.
We did not have our child, but Lion Air did not show us any compassion. "
After this meeting, Mr Kirana hastily left, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of a long process of identifying those who have died.
Nearly 140 corpses, loaded with human remains, have been handed over to police medical experts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
The relatives questioned why the liner, which was launched two months ago, was allowed to fly, although a fault occurred during the flight from Bali to Jakarta on October 28, which, among other things, caused passengers to be frightened by the sudden fall of the plane down immediately after take-off.
Lion Air said that this fault had been removed.
"Is it true that the problem has been solved?" asked the son of one of the dead.
- If not, the relevant technicians must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, it was not they who said that the aircraft was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must respond according to the law so that plane crashes in Indonesia do not happen again.
Mr Tjahjon said the large amount of small debris and the fact that the debris was scattered in a relatively small area indicate that the liner was likely to fly into the water at very high speeds.
"The aircraft was solid when it fell into the sea.
It did not explode in the air, and the aircraft's engines were operating in large turns when it touched the water, as evidenced by all the broken turbine blades, "the official explained.
The Lion Air liner crash is the biggest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when a Garuda plane crashed near Medan killing 234 people.
Rescuers were evacuated from the debris after the accident: a minor was also injured
On Monday evening, BMW and Mercedes-Benz cars collided on the road Vėžaičiai - Plungė, near Tilvikai.
The car collided with a cactus and three people were reported to have been injured.
It is reported that the BMW driver, who was born in 1999, drove to the opposite side of the road and crashed into the Mercedes-Benz car, which was attended by his dad, born in 1967, and his daughter, born in 2005.
The driver of the BMW was rescued from the debris by firefighters and rescuers.
The girl was knocked out of the Mercedes-Benz during the accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
President: No artificial relief is needed for the referendum
After the Seimas approved the proposal of the ruling parties to reduce the referendum bar for the first section of the Constitution, which currently has greater protection, the president will veto the amendments, says her adviser Mindaugas Lingė.
"More than half of the population voted in favour of the Constitution, which is a requirement.
This and its amendment, especially the articles in its first section, should certainly be no less than a majority.
It is easy to predict that the president would definitely veto it, "Dalia Grybauskaitė, an adviser to internal politics, told News Radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamental subjects of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty. Therefore, reducing the number of votes necessary to change these articles would create a "negative precedent" and "open up an uncontrollable risk."
"In the President's opinion, there is no need for artificial facilitations, there is more need to prepare for the referendum itself, and more dialogue with the people is needed," he said.
The Seimas plans to vote on the adoption of an amendment to the Referendum Act on Tuesday.
It stipulates that the decision on amendments to the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution with higher protection shall be taken if at least two fifths of the citizens with electoral rights agree to this in a referendum.
Currently, more than half of all citizens with voting rights can change the articles of the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution by referendum.
Approximately 2.5 million citizens have electoral rights in Lithuania: half would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths would be a million voters.
This proposal was born after the Seimas in September approved the president's veto on amendments previously adopted in parliament, which relaxed the requirements for the number of votes by changing Article 12 of the First Section of the Constitution, which defines citizenship.
The threshold for a referendum is proposed to be reduced in the run-up to the referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on 12 May next year and on 26 May next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential elections are planned.
Those who migrated after the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990 are currently unable to have dual citizenship, with the exception of some exceptions.
The Lithuanian community of the world seeks dual citizenship, but fears that under the current conditions the referendum would not take place - a sufficient number of people would not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports are "strawberry," so they need to be updated
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads is starting to deteriorate, so it needs to be upgraded, says Minister of Transport Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius Airport is the minimum task that the state must carry out.
"The air transport infrastructure is already running out because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must upgrade Vilnius Airport - it does not even fall into further planning, it is a minimum of what we must do, "Mr. Masiulis said at a communication conference organised by the Democratic Development Fund and the magazine" Valstybė "on Tuesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, because important projects will have to be implemented - Via Baltica, Rail Baltica has been completed, Klaipeda's external port has been built, Vilnius and Kaunas airports have been renovated, and perhaps a new airport has been built.
"The next decade will be very important - we have to complete the integration of roads, railways, construction of an external port in Klaipėda, arrange airports, maybe decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, we must start projects now that will exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years' time, "said Minister of Transport.
Mr Masiulis has reiterated that there has been too little funding for road maintenance in recent years.
"The state of the roads is not improving so far because there is not enough funding available.
We are predicting the construction of new roads, but even for the most basic maintenance, such as on expressways, there is a lack of funds.
We must set the amount to be allocated for road maintenance if we want their condition to improve, "said Mr. Masiulis.
He stressed that Lithuanian transport sector services exports grew by 18.6% this year, while Germany, which overtook Russia, became the largest export market.
Mr Masiulis has once again criticised the European Commission's proposal, which will require carriers from EU countries to return trucks to the country of registration periodically.
"We must make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposal for trucks to return home on a regular basis is absurd, as empty trucks would drive in Europe, fuel would burn and emissions would increase.
Most of this will be won by the railways, as the costs will increase so much that part of the transport will go to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions, "said Mr. Masiulis.
According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the transport sector accounts for 12.2%.
Lithuania's gross domestic product (GDP).
It employs more than 118.000 employees and operates more than 7,500 companies.
Dispute with hereditary guardians
Last week, Mr. Masiulis announced to the Economic Committee of the Seimas that he had started negotiations on the replacement of the cultural purpose of the Vilnius Airport building, which would allow the demolition of the old terminal and the construction of a new one.
However, Algimantas Degutis, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD), called Mr. Masiulis's deliberations a political pressure.
According to him, the building, built in the 1950s, is a value that was listed on the register in 1993, and it is not up to politicians, but specialists, to decide on its removal.
Mr. Masiulis commented at the time that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to the improvement of Lithuania's image.
"To pull that old terminal out of its heritage would be a politically important step, so that it could be demolished and a new modern arrival terminal could be built, so that when you come to Vilnius you feel in a modern country, rather than in such an interesting, really unrepresentative of our country as innovative," Mr. Masiulis said at the Seimas last week.
Mr. Masiulis also announced at the time that it is planned to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and to connect the airport with the Rail Baltica track by building an underground station.
This transport hub is expected to operate in 2026 after the completion of Rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year it is expected to have 4.8 million passengers, and next year - 5 million.
Last year, Kaunas Airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers.
What does Lithuanian troops do in Afghanistan?
The BNS presents the tasks they carry out.
A total of almost 50 Lithuanian troops serve in Afghanistan.
Kabul.
The headquarters of Kabul International Airport, located in the capital of Afghanistan, serves soldiers of the logistic element, serving all Lithuanians deployed in the country, organizing visits and rotation of troops.
Two soldiers of the Lithuanian Special Operations Forces also serve at this Headquarters, ensuring interaction between the NATO mission command and combat support with the "spec" in Kandahar.
Military policemen supervising public order are serving in the NATO mission "Robust Support."
Officers of the Lithuanian Headquarters serve in the same command.
They are responsible for intelligence, operations, planning and logistics.
Kandahar.
About 30 Lithuanian Special Operations Forces serve in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.
They train a special operations unit of the local police, where about 150 Afghans serve.
SOP soldiers train officers at their own training sites or outside them.
"Aitvarai" is also assisted by a soldier of the Air Force who manages unmanned aircraft.
Herat.
Staff officers serve at the headquarters in this city in the north-west of Afghanistan.
They work on boards responsible for military training, logistics, reconnaissance, operations and planning.
Next year Vilnius will start direct flights to Madagascar
In the spring of next year, the largest regular passenger plane Boeing 767 will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly travellers from Lithuania directly to the island of Bė belonging to Madagascar, according to the information of the tour operator Itaka Lietuva, writes the portal "madeinvilnius.lt."
It is announced that Blue Panorama airlines passengers will be able to choose from 259 economy class and 8 business class seats.
The new holiday direction will be available directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominikas Millowskis, CEO of Itaka Lietuva, says that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer new holiday destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, close to the east coast of Africa.
Other tour operators have also prepared new holiday destinations for the summer 2019 season.
For example, Novaturas and Itaka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tiran (Albania).
Minister of Finance on a possible crisis: it is important not to talk about the disease
"We always have to get ready for more difficult times.
What I would like to say is that for the third year in a row we are accumulating reserves for the first time in the history of Lithuania.
But it is also a very important thing not to talk about the disease, "Šapoka said during his visit to Brussels on Monday.
The ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday the Minister of Finance and Deputy Minister Miglė Tuskienė is taking part in the meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The issues relating to the taxation of digital services are discussed at the Ecofin meeting.
The aim of this new tax is to avoid fragmentation of the EU's single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed that an agreement be reached on how revenue generated for the provision of certain digital services in EU Member States should be taxed until there is a global consensus.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected Italy's draft budget as not in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC has taken advantage of this opportunity.
For more information, please refer to Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union: options for implementing the European Deposit Insurance Scheme and reforms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports the stronger role of the ESM in financial assistance programmes, but it is considered that the functions of the ESM must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the functions of the ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Buračas.
Lithuanian labour traditions and customs
Recently it has been 120 years since the birth of Balys Buračas (1897-1972), a famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicler, ethnographer and ethnographer, in Sidariai, Šiauliai parish, in the then Šiauliai Governorate.
In commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian State, we have a great opportunity to remember how the national revival, which is filled with life, has called many Lithuanian people, including brothers Buračus - Bali, Jonas, Bronys - from the very depths of the village to get involved in the fostering, meaning and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Buračas, who has travelled around his home country for more than 50 years with a camera in his hands, presented a wide and realistic picture of our country's customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing layers of national culture and had a rare ability to understand the lasting value of his work.
In the photographs of Balys Buračas, the Lithuanian landscape, hillforts, our people, immortalised in the environment of everyday life and holidays, decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication contains a significant part of the legacy of Balys Buračas, dedicated to the description of national labour customs and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilisation over the last century, despite two world wars and a difficult occupation.
The manuscript of the book is very rich in the works of the interwar inhabitants of Samogitia, especially Kupiškėnai, Šiauliai, Telšiškiai, as well as the residents of Aukštaitija and Dzūkija, their holidays and other traditions and customs written by Balys Buračas.
More than 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photos were selected from about 10,000 negatives stored in museums and archives, which were grouped according to the selected texts.
They reflect unique aspects of ethnic culture, typical of Kupiškėnai, dzukai, and other districts of Aukštaitija and Samogitia.

Tragic fate of the couple: killed after just a few hours of marriage
In the southwest of the US state of Texas, a couple of newlyweds were killed in a helicopter crash just a few hours earlier.
William Troy Byler, 24, and his co-wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler were killed on Sunday shortly after midnight by a helicopter crashed into a hill 16 km northwest of Juvaldi and 129 km west of San Antonio, local peace judge Steven Kennedy said.
It is strange that the accident occurred when it was about 24 kilometres away, just as the newlyweds were years old.
The helicopter pilot, 76 years old Gerald Douglas Lawrence, was also killed.
The newlyweds studied at Sam Houston State University, located in the Texas state of Hantsville.
They married on Saturday evening at the Byleriai family ranch near Juvaldis and flew out by a family helicopter after the wedding celebration.
The accident occurred when a helicopter flew about 24 kilometres away.
The newlyweds flew to Sant Antonius International Airport, where they were planning to board a plane and fly for a honeymoon, Mr Kennedy said, without specifying the couple's final destination.
"It is a very rocky, uneven terrain, and that hill is about 120-150 metres high," Mr Kennedy said.
G. D. Lawrence has been piloting the aircraft of that family for many years.
According to Mr Kennedy, he was piloting helicopters and serving in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should be revealed what the pilot's physical condition was and whether it could not become the cause of the crash.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after take-off.
Its debris was spotted in a wide radius on the rocky slope of the hill, and the hull was left "dangerously hanging," flight safety investigator Craig Hatch of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said at a press conference on Monday.
Investigators intend to remove the debris and then thoroughly inspect it, but it will not be easy for the tractor and truck to reach the site, he said.
The cause of the accident has not yet been determined, and a preliminary NTSB report is expected to be published in two weeks' time.
Israeli Prime Minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions on Iran a "historic day"
"Today is a historic day," Netanyahu told members of his Likud party, his office reported.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of President (Donald) Trump, the US is imposing extremely harsh sanctions on Iran, the harshest sanctions on Iran in all the time that efforts to curb its aggression have begun," the head of the Israeli government said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would strike a "decisive" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls "the strictest sanctions of all time," came after Mr Trump's controversial decision in May to withdraw from a global powers agreement with Tehran over his nuclear programme.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which have already fallen by about a million barrels a day since May, and to cut Tehran off from international funding.
Israel has long opposed the agreement with Iran and says that its scope and deadlines are too limited.
The Jewish state also says the lifting of sanctions has allowed Iran to fund militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria and has promised not to allow it to establish itself there militarily.
Other participants in the agreement with Iran - Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - do not agree with the US decision and say that the agreement, as envisaged, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court revisits the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
In the case of the accident that ended in the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, in the northern town, the court will hear the testimony of a witness.
The Vilnius Regional Court decided on Tuesday that in order to find out all the significant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses of the case will be questioned at the next hearing on November 26.
An acquittal has already been handed down in this case, but the Prosecutor's Office does not agree with it.
On August 22, Vilnius City District Court acquitted the driver of the car, 79 years old Eduard Osipov, of the accident that resulted in the death of a motorist, after declaring that the motorist was driving at high speed in the city and committing a gross violation.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office is asking the District Court to annul the sentence of the District Court and states that the main fault for the accident lies with E. Osipov, and the findings of the District Court are unfounded.
The family lawyer of the deceased motorist is also asking for the acquittal to be overturned.
The accident took place on August 11, 2015 at about 15: 00, when Skoda Fabia, a car driven by E. Osipov, drove from Lakūnai Street to Žirmūnai Street and collided with a motorcycle on the main road.
The prosecutor accused the man of violating the Road Traffic Rules, which provide for the road, and caused a traffic accident by killing a man who was driving a Piaggo motorcycle on the main road.
Initial police reports indicated that the driver of the scooter was killed, but later, after investigations, it was found that the vehicle was equivalent to a motorcycle by power.
Judge Rolandas Bužinskas of Vilnius City District Court told BNS that experts found that the driver of the motorcycle was driving at a speed of 89.2 kilometres per hour, even though the permissible speed in that place was 50 kilometres per hour.
"The driver of the car could not predict that the motorcycle would be driving at such a high speed," the judge said.
At the time, the driver of the venerable car claimed to have been driving at speeds of just 5-6 kilometres per hour.
The motorcycle driver, who saw the crash, tried to stop and fell from the vehicle before colliding with Skoda Fabia.
The prosecutor believes that Mr Osipov, who was driving from the side to the main road, had to give way to the rider.
Novaya Gazeta: Six Wagner mercenaries killed in Syria
Among the dead were five Syrian military personnel and six people belonging to Wagner, a military company.
This is reported by the Novaya Gazeta source in Syria.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5th Syrian Armed Forces Corps was deployed in the area, which was joined by a number of Syrian volunteers and "military mercenaries."
Novaya Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide information on the fate of the Russians.
Former King of Belgium to undergo a paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for the artist Delphine Boel.
Since 2013, she has been seeking recognition as the child of the former monarch.
The 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II, had a short love novel decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies fatherhood.
According to the station RTBF, he can appeal to the Supreme Court in opposition to the DNA test.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel, the former husband of Delphine's mother, is neither biological nor legal father of the artist.
Delphine appealed for the relevant investigation to be recognised as the daughter of a "real" father, Albert.
The CoR will distribute money to the parties, but will not give anything to the social workers
This week, the High Electoral Commission (HEC) intends to allocate a budget grant of almost EUR 3 million to the largest political parties.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), which was established in the spring of this year, under the leadership of the Vice President of the Parliament Gediminas Kirkškis, has not yet been allocated funds from the budget.
But they may be allocated in the near future by a separate decision of the CoR if the legal environment governing the distribution of grants to parties changes.
Laura Matjošaityte, President of the CoR, told the VŽ that "this Thursday a meeting of the commission is scheduled to take a decision on the allocation of the budget's half-yearly grant to the parties."
According to her, the CoR has until 15 November to take a decision on this issue.
It is estimated that EUR 2.751 million will be allocated to seven parties, six of which are parliamentary.
The opposition Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than EUR 0.66 million, the ruling Union of Peasants and Greens - about EUR 0.55 million, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about EUR 0.5 million, the opposition Liberal Movement - almost EUR 0.4 million, the Labour Party, which does not have its own group in the Seimas - about EUR 0.23 million, the recently joined the ruling Party of Order and Justice - almost EUR 0.22 million, represented in parliament, but neither the ruling nor the opposition Polish Electoral Action - the Union of Christian Families - about EUR 0.18 million.
According to the current law, which will be followed by the CoR when distributing budget money, grants are allocated to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections of the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow the LSDDP, which was established in the spring of this year, to expect to receive money from the budget.
As yet, this party has not participated in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers receive at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the run-up to next year's three elections - the self-government, the president and the European Parliament.
The corresponding amendments to the laws of political parties and this year's budget adopted by the Seimas were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the representatives of the ruling parties, Mr. Kirkilas, and the leader of the peasant Greens, Ramūnas Karbauskis, believe that the parliamentarians will seek to reject the president's objections.
However, this will not be possible until this Thursday's meeting of the CoR, so, according to Mr. Matjošaitytė, "grants will be distributed in accordance with the legal order that has existed so far."
It is true that the Head of the CoR did not rule out that if the Seimas rejects the veto of the President this or next week and the new amendments on the allocation of budget funds to the parties enter into force, the Commission may consider the decision on the appointment of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"When making a decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in force, because we are an executive body that has to implement the laws that are adopted," she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject the veto and the new laws came into force, additional money would be allocated to the parties by the Government, which has borrowed the corresponding amounts for this purpose.
The grants already allocated to the seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

Poroshenko: Victims of the murder of activist Handziuk must be punished
"I would like to state that no version - and more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each will be scrutinised very carefully, in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As President, I do not have the opportunity or the obligation to obtain information that could undermine the course of the investigation.
However, the authorities must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to know the truth and punish evil, "Poroshenko said at a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he was most interested in clarifying Handziuk's murder and that the murderers, the organisers of the crime and the customers "take the necessary responsibility."
"After this case has been converted into a murder (case), they are quite rightly and reasonably threatened with a life sentence," the Ukrainian president said.
He rightly called the public's demand for an open and impartial investigation of the case.
Poroshenko stressed that the statements of law enforcement representatives in parliament should show that "the government is determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice, whoever they may be."
He also said that political speculation on this subject will not help to clarify the situation, but will confuse things even more.
"I urge all forces, both the government and the opposition, not to waste unsubstantiated arguments and, God forbid, not to use this murder for public relations," the president said.
On the contrary, we now need to unite to ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, and fast, in order to build public confidence.
There is simply no other way for us. "
"No one will be allowed to use this situation to destabilise the situation in the country," he said.
Ms Handziuk, who has been fighting corruption, was attacked and covered with acid in the city of Cherson in July.
She was an adviser to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
The woman was hospitalised after the attack, but died in hospital on Sunday.
After the police and prosecutors did not explain the perpetrators of the attack, Ukraine's Attorney General, Yuri Lucenka, issued a statement of resignation on Tuesday.
In the wake of her death, government officials have faced accusations from public activists that they are failing to carry out an investigation properly.
Activists have also called for the resignation of the Attorney General and the Minister of the Interior.
"I am making a statement of my resignation today," Mr Lucenka told MPs, reading his investigation report.
Parliament has yet to approve the resignation of the Attorney General.
Mr Lucenka accused the activists of pressuring the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of Ms Handziuk's murder.
Bill Gates introduced a toilet without water
Presenting a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional such facilities to plumbing to the computer revolution of the 1970s.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates presented a high-tech toilet at an exhibition in Beijing that does not require water in tap pipes, Reuters reported.
Toilet without water works in accordance with the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of wastewater are recycled into chemical fertilisers.
"The technologies you see here are the greatest achievements in sanitation in the last 200 years," Mr Gates was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.
The technological toilet was created by a charity fund set up by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Over seven years, work has been carried out on a facility that could turn human waste into fertiliser or water, for which the fund has spent USD 200 million.
In total, according to Bill Gates, about 20 toilet models have been developed.
Now the device is finished and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be produced en masse, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500 thousand children under the age of five die every year due to poor sanitation conditions around the world.
The fight against problems caused by poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, is increasing the funds spent on health care, which already amount to 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates put a jar of faeces into a toilet presentation.
According to him, this is a good reminder that in a small example "there may be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria that cause infectious diseases, 100 thousand worm parasite eggs."

Slyva will complete the term of office started by A.Stecenko, which will last until January 2021.
Anxiety in France: human deaths are a concern
French health officials announced on Monday a permanent ban on the widely used pesticide, amid concerns about several dozen people who have recently been poisoning in the west of the country.
The health agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all products with the pesticide methamphetamine was taken following a new safety check launched earlier this year, just before at least three waves of poisoning began in September in the Department of Art and Loire.
As a result of these cases, the government has already suspended the use of pesticides.
This soil disinfectant chemical should not contact plants or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, around 700 tonnes were used every year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, have complained of eye and throat swelling and breathing problems in the Angers region, where many salad succulents are grown.
"These episodes confirm the fairness of our decision, but they did not hasten it," ANSES deputy director Francoise Weber told the Ouest France newspaper on Monday.
Metam, one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and Europe, is considered by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to be a "likely human carcinogen."
This pesticide, which is sold under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is permitted in Europe until 2022, when a new safety check is to be carried out.
"There was no other option but to remove it from the market, regardless of whether there are alternatives to it," Weber told the newspaper.
"We understand the difficulties that salad juice growers, farmers in general, will face, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed their dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to suspend the use of meth in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
In this region, near Nantes, more than half of the 35 thousand tons of salad juice consumed in Europe every year are grown.
Next season there will be "a lot less salad juice, radishes and pores," Philippe Retiere, the head of the Nantes Federation of Growers, told AFP news agency last month after the government suspended the use of meatballs.
EUR 70 million invested in a shopping centre with a viewing wheel in Tallinn
Next weekend a new T1 shopping centre will be opened in the capital of Estonia, where the local real estate (real estate) development company Pro Kapital Grupp has invested EUR 70 million.
The 130,000 sq. m total, or 55,000 sq. m leased, shopping centre will have 150 shops or entertainment venues, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, according to the developer's report.
In comparison, the total area of Vilnius "Akropolis" (counting together with the area for offices) is about 110,000 sq. m. And for rent - 91.000 sq. m.
"T1" is the first shopping centre with a viewing wheel on the roof, according to the developer.
It will be operational at the beginning of next year.
In addition, international transport gates will also be integrated into the territory: trams will be installed next to them and intercity buses will soon be created.
Nearby, the main Rail Baltica terminal is also located, and it is estimated that in about 2026 it will serve 1 million passengers per year.
Paul Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says that major changes are taking place in the global supermarket business, and T1 has been at the forefront of them.
"We have created a new generation of shopping centres that provide emotions and experiences that are not accessible online.
It is a place of attraction for people in the very centre of the city, a gateway for travellers, an impressive and noteworthy object and, at the same time, a qualitatively spent time with friends or family, "Mr. Michelozzi is quoted in the press release.
Attention to entertainment
According to the manager of the shopping centre, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery centre in the Baltic States.
In total, 12,000 sq. m is allocated for entertainment in the object, or a fifth of the total rented area.
Exceptional highlight - a viewing wheel is installed on the roof.
It will lift guests to a height of 120 m above sea level - only a TV tower is higher in Tallinn.
Under the observation wheel, on the fourth floor, there will be a trampoline park "Super Skypark," which will open the largest trampoline centre in Europe and the first basketball and volleyball court in Estonia, according to the company.
The interactive "SkyLAB" research and discovery centre promises to take children at least 5-6 hours.
The entertainment complex will also have a 360-degree panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the usual cinema shown in six halls, visitors will also be able to experience virtual reality cinema with interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to visual effects and moving chairs according to the rhythm of the film, the feeling of reality will be strengthened here by the felt effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as selected smells, smoke or fog in the cinema hall.
According to the developer, it is expected that the opening of T1 will increase Estonia's tourism revenues by EUR 13 million per year, attracting over 300.000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Exchange, as well as on the Frankfurt Exchange.
Last year, the group received EUR 1.8 million in sales revenue in Lithuania and suffered a loss of EUR 350,000, according to the financial report of Pro Kapital Grupp.
In 2016, the Lithuanian market received almost EUR 9 million in sales revenue and earned a net profit of EUR 2.4 million.
The T1 shopping centre was built by the Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
In Cameroon, President Paul Biya is sworn in for a seventh term after controversial elections
During a ceremony supervised by the president of the parliament, Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, 85, Mr Biya promised to protect the "integrity and unity" of the West African state.
Africa's oldest president, who has been in power for 35 years, was declared the winner in the elections on 7 October, with 71% of the vote.
However, the elections have been overshadowed by low voter turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Mr. Biya's inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including a principal, were kidnapped at one Presbyterian school in the North West region, where English-speaking separatists are conducting an armed campaign for independence.
The majority of Cameroon's 22 million inhabitants are French-speaking and a fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, the North-West and the neighbouring South-West province began to demand autonomy in the wake of dissatisfaction with alleged discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy.
In 2017, when Mr. Biya refused to appease, the radicals declared an independent state, the "Republic of Ambazonia," and raised their weapons.
According to non-governmental organisations, separatist attacks and government retaliatory operations have killed at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces officers this year.
More than 300,000 people have fled the violence, some across the border to Nigeria, but many are forced to live in semi-starved forests.
In the elections in October, only 5% of the electorate voted in the North West region and 15% in the South-West province.
In both parts of the country, Mr Biya won two thirds of the vote.
Conservative primary election: mistakes were caused by inexperience
"There was something missing in places - understand that the party organized everything with its resources.
Some municipalities have allowed their premises to be used, but there have not been voting cabins everywhere, because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank you to those who have lent, "- said the politician.
According to him, complaints have been received, but their content does not change substantially, and the violations themselves are not malignant.
"There were complaints.
Not all the people who took part in the elections had experienced it - it was also news for them.
As a result, not all actions have been in line with our procedures.
It was therefore necessary to warn the CRC that the principles we have described should be respected.
These complaints do not give rise to doubts about the results, "- said A. Anušauskas.
According to the President of the CoR, there have been cases where the ballot papers have been unsealed - after learning of this, the ballots found in the ballot boxes without a stamp have been annulled.
There was a lack of space in some towns, but according to A. Anušauskas, complaints and violations were related to several dozen bulletins.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, it does not make a fundamental difference to the results of the elections," - explained A. Anušauskas.
It is claimed that the turnout of party members in the elections was 55%, while the turnout of non-party voters was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked on commissions.
The results announced on Sunday are also unchanged - 79% of the voters (16418 votes) voted for Ingrida Šimonytė, while 21% (4441 votes) voted for Vygaudas Ušackas.
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will officially support the candidacy of I. Šimonytė in the presidential elections of the country in May next year.
Trump says he will probably not meet Putin in Paris
White House national security adviser John Bolton said earlier that Mr Trump would meet Mr Putin in Paris, where events will take place this week to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War.
However, leaving for the last rallies before the mid-term elections of the US Congress, Mr Trump told reporters he was not sure whether it would be a suitable opportunity to meet the Russian president.
"I am not sure if we will meet in Paris.
Probably not, "noted the President of the United States.
However, the White House chief added, he would see the G-20 summit and "probably meet many times" afterwards.
Mr Trump is still trying to "reboot" relations with Moscow, despite allegations that Russia was meddling in the 2016 US presidential election.
Kęstutis Strupas asks for the decision of VTEK to be annulled
Kęstutis Strupas, the former CEO of Santara Clinics of Vilnius University, is asking for the decision of the High Official Ethics Commission (VTEK) to be annulled, acknowledging that transactions that have not been declared in time are in violation of the law.
The complaint of K. Strupas was examined by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be published on 26 November.
The applicant is asking for the decision of the VTEK on May 23 to be annulled, court spokeswoman Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduone told BNS.
Mr Strupas believes that gifts given to relatives should not be declared, and he says he has understood the exception of the law.
In May, the VTEK announced that the then deposed Director General of Santara Clinics K. Strupas and the Head of the Outpatient Rehabilitation Division of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital Silvija Strupienė violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
During the investigation, it was found that four transactions were declared without complying with the deadlines: in 2010 a loan was taken from the bank with the spouse, acquisition of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift - an apartment was given to the daughter in 2017, and in 1996 a loan was granted to a natural person together with the spouse.
Strupienė also declared these transactions by skipping the deadlines.
Individuals who have violated the law on the coordination of public and private interests in the civil service cannot be encouraged for a year.
The law obliges you to declare not only your own data, but also your spouse's data.
The investigation was carried out by the VTEK on the basis of "Info TV" television information.
It was explained whether K. Strupas and his spouse, S. Strupas, Head of the Outpatient Rehabilitation Division of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, properly and in time declared the transactions they had concluded.
According to "Info TV," last year K. Strupas gave his daughter real estate worth 125 thousand euros.
However, the former head of Santara's clinics and his wife did not indicate their interests in the declarations.
Law enforcement has made allegations against Mr Strup, along with at least ten others, in a corruption investigation - according to law enforcement, illegal financial rewards were demanded from companies for winning public procurement of computers and software in clinics, and he was disguised as support.
In this way, Strupas is suspected of having consulted at least five times during public procurement in the field of information technology at Santara clinics.
Mr Strupas himself denies his guilt.
Professor Strupas, who is suspected of corruption, was sacked from the position of head of Santara Clinics in September.
The decision of the Ministry of Health of Santara Clinics and Vilnius University to terminate the working relationship with K. Strupai at his own request.
He has been the head of the hospital since 10 November 2013.
The Santara Clinics continue to be temporarily led by Professor Juozas Raistenskis, and until the contest for the election of a new CEO is held, it is promised to be announced later this year.

Schools already want to teach differently: promises fewer tests, more practice
Such changes in the content of education are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them at the forum "Change of the content of education: Foreign Experience for Solutions in Lithuania" held in Vilnius on Monday.
Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė, who spoke at the discussion, said that over 30 million euros have been invested in the renewal of the content of education in the last ten years, but the results are not visible.
"According to the results of the PISA International Student Achievement Survey, students" achievements are below the average of OECD countries, "said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė.
Phil Lambert, an OECD expert quoted in the report by the Ministry of Education and Science, said that Lithuania was too focused on providing knowledge rather than on practical application of knowledge.
According to him, in Lithuania, general education programmes focus on students "literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but it is also necessary to develop children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy and empathy.
Vice-Minister of Education and Science Gražvydas Kazakevičius, presenting the changes in the content of general education, said that the scope of the programmes launched this school year will decrease, they will be more specific and the disciplines will be more closely linked to each other.
According to the Vice-Minister, students "education will be more individualized, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30% of the content of their unique education, the current system of assessment of students will change to a cumulative score, and the competences of the student acquired in an informal way will also gain more weight.
There will be fewer standardized tests.
It promises that general education programmes will be digital, user-friendly, connected to e-resources, and a task bank.
The aim of updating the content of education is to improve students "achievements in the international PISA study by at least 10%, to reduce the gap between students" achievements by a third, to give students modern competences at school, and to be literate in various fields.
From May 2018, Lithuania plans to allocate EUR 7.8 million to the European Union and the state budget to update the content of education.
It is expected that the project of the updated general education programmes will be tested in some schools during the 2019-2020 school year and will be launched in all schools from September 2021.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry received criticism for a project worth almost EUR 8 million by the Centre for Development of Education, aimed at updating the general programmes of primary, primary and secondary education.
EUR 7.8 million has been earmarked for this for four years, and the first purchase of EUR 1.3 million was announced at the beginning of October to look for the developers of educational programmes.
After the experts criticised this purchase, it was suspended, and the Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskienė dismissed Giedrius Vaidelis, the Director of the Centre for Development of Education.
Exercise on how to respond to extreme flooding in Lithuania
In Lithuania, a ten-day exercise to improve the response of institutions to extreme flooding begins on Monday.
As reported by the Department of Fire and Rescue (PAGD), the exercise will test the readiness of state authorities to work in the country in the event of a state level emergency, such as flooding: to deal with its consequences, to coordinate the search, rescue and immediate eviction of people from covered areas, to organise their supply of drinking water, food, to ensure the necessary energy supply and to provide other measures to protect the population.
More than 100 representatives from all ministries of the country, other institutions, as well as members of 12 municipal emergency operations centres will participate in the exercise.
On 5-13 November, the preparatory phase of the exercise will take place, during which the municipalities, having received information from the Hydrometeorological Service about persistent precipitation and flooding, will make decisions on emergency management.
The active phase of the exercise is planned on November 14-15.
During this period, the Department will operate the State Emergency Operations Centre and the State and Municipal Institutions - the Institutions Emergency Operations Centres.
Following the announcement by the government of a state level emergency due to the effects of the flooding, the Head of Operations appointed by the Prime Minister will lead the emergency management, the elimination of its consequences, the protection and rescue of residents and property.
Deputy Director of PAGD Mindaugas Kanapickas says that the most important thing in the exercise is to check the readiness of the institutions to perform the functions provided for in the legislation, to evaluate the possibilities to exchange information, to check how they are prepared to warn and inform residents, state and municipal institutions, institutions and companies about the impending disaster, and to "improve the emergency management skills of state institutions."
The exercise will also demonstrate the joint capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian fire-fighters to pump a large amount of water from the covered areas.
The module "BaltFoodCombat" was established for this purpose in 2009.
The Attorney General of Ukraine Yuri Lucenka resigns
Ukraine's Attorney General, Yuri Lucenka, announced his resignation in the country's parliament on Tuesday due to the death of Katerina Gandziuk, a corruption fighter, according to Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
According to Ukrainian law, the request for resignation must be submitted by the Attorney General to the President of the country, and the latter must be submitted to the Supreme Rada for approval by a majority.
On Tuesday, Attorney General J. Lucenko presented the progress and results of a law enforcement investigation into the murder of Mr. Gandziuk in the Supreme Court.
In a speech to MPs, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed outrage that Mr Gandziuk's death was being exploited by politicians for public relations.
Ms Gandziuk was a Ukrainian activist and anti-corruption activist who spoke publicly about police corruption in her home town of Chersone in southern Ukraine.
On July 31, an unknown attacker, Mrs Gandziuk, threw acid in her face near her home.
She died in hospital on 4 November due to injuries.
Protesters outside the Ukrainian Ministry of the Interior are demanding an answer on who killed Mr Gandziuk, AFP / Scanpix Photo
According to Lucenko, there are 12 people in the law enforcement investigation who may have been involved in the murder of Mr Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the investigation has been leaked to the media, which threatens the success of the investigation.
According to the Attorney General, because of the leak of information, the suspects received essential knowledge.
Mr Lucenko added that he had personally known Mr Gandziuk and was outraged that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
'That no one has reason to say that someone is in power, I want to state that I am making a statement to resign.
I will present it to the President of Ukraine today, and you will have to discuss this issue in parliament, "Mr Lucenko's speech in Rada is quoted by the Obozrevatel publication.
Lucenko added that he "cannot allow a two-state solution in a country where the law enforcement system is destroyed without any evidence, even for the crimes uncovered."
Mr Lucenko is seen as a close friend of the country's President, Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed Attorney General on 12 May 2016 after protracted attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, suspected of corruption by top officials and politicians, from the post.
Minister of Energy Ž. Vaičiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As reported by Aurelija Vernickaitė, Counsellor of the Minister of Energy, the meeting will focus on achieving the renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector that currently does not reach the aggregated trajectory of the national renewable energy action plans at EU level, with a 6% share of renewable energy in 2015.
According to the EC, progress towards the mandatory 10% target in the transport sector is relatively slow due to various difficulties, including relatively high greenhouse gas reduction costs and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector mainly comes from biofuels (88%), while electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.
The parliament has launched a proposal to supplement corruption investigation issues with a Conservative appeal to the CT
On Tuesday, after the presentation, the Seimas approved such a proposal, which was registered by Agnė Širinskienė, the "peasant" who leads the investigation into illegal influence on political processes.
There were 58 members of the Seimas, 27 against, nine abstentions.
The draft will be discussed further by the Seimas Committees, the main appointed Committee on Law and Law Enforcement, led by A. Širinskienė.
Once it has been concluded, a vote will be held on the adoption of the amendment to the resolution.
Currently, the Temporary Commission of Inquiry of the Seimas, which is conducting a new investigation into political corruption, has been instructed to investigate possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
A. Širinskienė proposed to extend this term by pointing out that "significant information about possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and public institutions has appeared in the public space."
A. Širinskienė identifies in the draft "possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or by appealing to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions as the High Official Ethics Commission."
The appeal to the Constitutional Court on pensions was initiated by the opposition Conservatives.
The ruling "peasants" found that the Conservatives relied largely on the arguments of private pension fund lawyers in their appeal.
The leaders of the "peasants" accuse former comrade Povilas Urbšis of influencing the High Commission of Official Ethics (VTEK).
According to them, the former chairman of the Committee on State Governance and Municipalities of the Seimas may have ordered the members of the VTEK to dismiss Mindaugas Siauris, the former head of the Preventive Division of the Commission.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission to explain the possibly illegal influence of interested persons or their groups, the impact on the course of elections, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary groups, individual politicians, the activities and funding of parties and public movements, legislative processes, the election and appointment of members of state-owned enterprises, heads of public institutions, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to look at the information provided by law enforcement and intelligence authorities to the competent authorities and how it was responded to.
The researchers are expected to present their findings by 1 May next year.
At that time, there will be an election campaign for the President, for the European Parliament.
Of the 12 members of the commission, seven are "peasants."
Its members were also appointed by two social workers, one "bandleader," a liberal and a representative of the Lithuanian Polish-Christian Families Union.
The Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to participate in the work of the commission.
The new investigation was initiated by Ramūnas Karbauskis, the chairman of the ruling Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union.
According to him, the investigation carried out by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSGK) last session, mainly on the same subjects, showed that the investigation needed to be continued.
German head of internal intelligence lost his post
The 55-year-old Maassen was further incensed by his claims that the "radical left forces" in Merkel's coalition were to blame for his troubles.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised in the past, but forced to leave.
Among other things, it emerged last weekend that, at a meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence organisations in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Mr Maassen criticised Mrs Merkel's'naïve 'immigration policy.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has long defended the head of intelligence, said at a press conference on Monday that Mr Maassen's recent comments were unacceptable and he was "disappointed personally."
Mr Seehofer, who himself has been under pressure both because of this dispute and because of his party's poor performance in the Bavarian local elections, has asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release Mr Maassen to the bench.
Virtual shark attacks have intimidated the entire island - a third person has been bitten
A Queensland Ambulance Service report said the victim suffered "serious leg and wrist wounds" during the attack near Pentecost Island in Sid Harboro, off the coast of Queensland state.
The man was taken by helicopter to the hospital.
Pentecost Island is the largest of the archipelago of the same name, attracting many diving and sailing enthusiasts from all over the world.
Shark attacks in this region have so far been relatively rare.
On 19 September, one woman was attacked in Sid Harbor, and the next day a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay.
The last time a shark attack took place in the archipelago in 2010 was before the latest string of attacks.

Tape girls break down stereotypes about wedding dresses
A plump girl with a white fluffy bridal dress - mission (no) possible?
Can a white swan floating towards the altar be larger than the size of S or M and still look attractive?
Plus the participants of the size reality show "The Evolution of Size (r)" will already prove today that the beauty and elegance of the bride does not depend on the kilos of a woman.
But it's not all - one of the girls of the project will be left with tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will appear in the filming area.
"There are still those who think that the bigger girls do not get the attention or gaze of the guys.
This is just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but I like him as I am, he does not require a figure that meets some standards from me, "- Aurika, the show's participant, will speak before the show with a wedding dress.
Wedding dress is not easy, in all senses, the garment is a complex construction, it has a lot of material, the dress is heavy, it is uncomfortable for movement.
Some women also think that a larger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident.
I can reassure you that a properly chosen dress model really solves this "problem," - explained one of the members of the show's commission, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
The fate of the girls in the project is decided by R. Kalinkin together with the entire commission - Erika Vitulskiene, who opened the fashion house, photographer and social media star Naglis Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukštas.
"When deciding which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there is a lot of controversy between the members of the commission - after all, we all represent different spheres and imagine the winner of the show differently.
The task of demonstrating wedding dresses was made even more difficult by the fact - I can now reveal - that two newcomers appeared, which were certainly not inferior to the old ones.
It was a special evening in every sense, "- says R. Kalinkin.
The newlyweds - Ieva, 23, who became famous for her scandalous behaviour on one summer reality show, and Dovilė, 31, the mother of two children of exceptional beauty - were among the other girls who took part in the "Size (r) evolution" selection and were in the top 20.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo session of the girls on the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls of the show were returned to the audience of LNK, who voted for their favourites on the television portal.
The reality show, which has received international recognition, is taking place in Lithuania for the second week - here plus size girls compete for the name of the first plus-size star in the country.
So far, only eight of them have been left - and they are all well aware that there will be only one winner.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show "The Evolution of Size (r)" begins this Monday evening at 20.30 pm via LNK.
Actor I. Elba was elected the sexiest man in the world
The US magazine People has announced this year's sexiest man in the world.
It was the 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that the news was unexpected when he spoke about the new title, he did not lack the wit.
I thought, 'Can't be!
Seriously? '.
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought - yes, today I looked sexy, "the actor shared with a laugh.
Speaking openly, Idris said that this title is a very pleasant feeling that has caught his ego.
The British star says he often received abusive words and bullying, which made his childhood difficult because, as he himself puts it, he was "very tall and nervous."
The young actor did not convince his peers and became the object of bullying because of his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
"As soon as I grew up with mustache and muscles, I became the hardest guy in my city district," Idris smiles.
When her husband doesn't have to be proud of the screens, Elba works as a DJ at parties held in Spain and especially in Ibiza.
In his spare time, the man enjoys Thai boxing and has a passion for fashion, which he implements by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor says his family is the most important thing in the world, so he is planning a wedding with his fiancee Sabrina Dhowre.
I. Elba became the 33rd sexiest man in the world elected by People magazine.
In 2017, the title was given to Blake Shelton.
A man beaten to death during a drinking session in Širvintai district
On Monday evening, a man was beaten to death during a drinking session in the village of Šalkiškiai in Širvintai district.
According to Vilnius County Police, at 21.16, a report was received that a man had beaten a neighbour during a drinking session.
When the medics arrived, they found the death of a man born in 1943.
The suspect, who was born in 1994, was arrested with 2.53 proms of drunkenness.
The police are investigating the circumstances of the incident.
Controllers no longer require a distance of 20 km when building waste incineration plants
Vilnius Cogeneration Power Plant is being built, near Gariūnai Market.
The authorities are no longer seeking to maintain a distance of 20 kilometres from the settlements when building waste incineration plants.
Kęstutis Mažeika, the head of the Environmental Protection Committee, registered an amendment to the Waste Management Act in the Seimas on Monday, which refuses such a requirement.
According to Mr. Mažeika, the "peasants" group, which has previously supported the provision on a distance of 20 km, promises to support the amendment on its refusal.
Mr Mažeika's amendment stipulates that from January 2019, waste incineration plants could be built with statutory environmental and public health requirements.
He admits that the amendments were prompted by the president's doubts about such a ban.
"Taking into account the definition of a residential area, it is obvious that a place where the above objects could be built would be almost impossible to discover," - says the chairman of the committee.
In October, the ruling majority opposed the president's veto amendments to tighten the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste incineration plants closer to 20 km from settlements, the amendments provided for permission for the Government to make decisions on the future of the two power plants already under construction, taking into account the interests of public health.
The latter provisions do not offer to be adjusted by Mrs Mažeika.
The waste and biofuel power plant in Vilnius is being built by the energy group Lietuvos Energija, and in Kaunas - together with Fortum Heat Lietuva, a company of the Finnish energy concern Fortum.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipėda.
Talk of a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
British and Irish leaders discussed on Monday a possible compromise on the complex issue of Northern Ireland, which is stalled in Brexit negotiations, Dublin reported.
Speaking by phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed a review of the so-called "insurance agreement" mechanism, which would allow the open border between the UK province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the European Union.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar promised to consider the proposal, but rejected any possibility for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from the agreement, according to a report published by the Irish government.
In the interview, Mrs May "raised the possibility of a review of the insurance mechanism," it said.
"Varadkar has made it clear that he is open to a review of the new proposals, provided that the result of such a review is not related to a unilateral decision to terminate the application of the insured measures," the government statement said.
Brexit negotiators are not finding an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland land border when Britain leaves the single market and customs union in March next year.
Both sides agree on'protective measures' to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a broader trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied provisionally to the whole of the UK.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit secretary Dominic Raab is seeking Britain to withdraw from the insurance deal unilaterally in three months.
However, Mr Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support this."
"Three-month or limited term insured measures are not worth the paper on which they will be written," he said.
In the past, London and Brussels have not confirmed details of the breakthrough in the Brexit negotiations following a report in Britain over the weekend that the deal is in hand.
"I would say that we are continuing to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to be done," said a spokesman for Mrs May in London.
The representative of the European Commission, Margaritis Schinas, also told journalists: 'We are not there yet'.
Nobel laureates call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel laureates, issued a declaration on Monday calling for the right to reliable information in the online era.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Senas and Joseph Stiglitz, Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize, and writer Mario Vargas Llosa, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature.
"We call on leaders of good will on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debate, where citizens can make decisions based on facts," the group said in a statement.
They argue that the'global space of information and communication 'is a common good that'must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion'.
"People have a fundamental right to receive information that is freely collected, processed and distributed on the basis of a commitment to the truth, principles of pluralism of views and rational methods of fact-finding," the authors of the declaration added.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who often criticises "fake news" but is regularly accused of distorting facts.
World leaders should take a position on this issue when they meet at the "Peace Forum" in Paris on 11-13 November, the signatories have called for.
This declaration was drafted within two months under the leadership of Mr Ebadi and Mr Christophe Deloire, the head of Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a media freedom and journalists' rights organisation based in Paris.
Other signatories include Abdu Diouf, the former President of Senegal, Teng Biao, a Chinese lawyer and human rights activist, and Francis Fukuyama, a political scientist.
Seimas approves higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Law on Product Safety, which stipulate that fines for product safety violations should be increased.
The amendments were adopted unanimously in the Chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health Affairs, said, when talking about the new project, it is to be welcomed that the objectives raised are related to better protection of consumers of products.
In addition, its provisions are adapted to the requirements of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"In my opinion, the proposed draft law is better and more specifically distributed to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: producers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As the practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further violations, as the entities that have paid the fines continue to commit repeated violations, "said A. Vinkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, after the approval of the Government, the Economic Committee of the Seimas supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim to increase fines for infringements, to strengthen the protection of consumer rights, to empower market surveillance authorities and to create a clear framework for monitoring and compliance with product safety requirements.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for manufacturers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the Ministry, market surveillance authorities did not have the right to enter the territory of manufacturers and suppliers, buildings, premises and carry out inspections, which makes the work of the institutions more difficult.
According to the Ministry, the six-month deadline for imposing fines and warnings is too short to detect an offence, to carry out an investigation and to impose a fine.
Also, according to the Ministry, the fines imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law, with 14 companies doing so in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Economy proposed to impose an obligation on manufacturers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability, so as to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to clarify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the right to enter the territory, buildings and premises of economic entities that produce, supply products to the market, through state product safety controls.
It is intended to increase the level of fines for violations of the law.
The manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who placed dangerous products on the market and the distributor who supplied them to the market would be fined between €150 and €2 500 (now from €144 to €1 448).
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (VCAT) or other market surveillance authority decides to ban the placing and supply of dangerous products on the market or the provision of dangerous services, a fine of between €1 000 and €5 000 (now from €868 to €4 344) would be imposed.
Failure to comply with the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of between €2500 and €6 500 (now between €1 448 and €5 792).
If dangerous products have caused harm to the health of the consumer, a fine of between €2 500 and €15 000 (now between €1 448 and €11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of the consumer, a fine of between €6 500 and €25 000 (now from €5 792 to €23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, violations of product safety legislation are punishable by a fine of up to EUR 25 thousand (no minimum amount is set), in Belgium a fine of EUR 26 to EUR 600 thousand, in Romania a fine of EUR 155 to EUR 6 666, in Bulgaria a fine of EUR 125 to EUR 7 500.

Norwegian Armed Battalion took part in NATO exercises in the most remote and harsh areas
Soldiers from the Norwegian Armed Forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the country's capital, Oslo.
It is part of the NATO exercise "Tri-Fork Connection 2018," the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the troops from the second battalion of the Norwegian Armed Forces spent a lot of time away from their homes after the September 11 terrorist attacks, in places such as Afghanistan - that is, in warm lands.
But most of all, they are skilled at fighting in the Arctic, and these skills are of great service now that NATO is changing its focus.
In recent days, in the mountains east of Tinseth, often in the most remote and harsh areas, soldiers have been involved in staged battles against real British troops.
The soldiers have the skills to survive this cold in the wild, but in the harsh climate they have to carry a much higher weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers staying at the command say that they share their skills on how to survive and fight in such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, which, like any other, are very reminiscent of real warfare, will teach them to be ready if there is a serious threat.

After leaving Kaunas Vice-Mayor does not plan to return to politics
Former Vice-Mayor of Kaunas Povilas Mačiulis, who left his job in the municipality and the organization of "United Kaunas" due to his support for Vygaudas Ušackas in the presidential elections, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
"I am going to concentrate on business.
I am a shareholder of several companies, and I also have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to spend more time on the family, "Mačiulis told BNS.
He said he also did not plan to take part in the upcoming municipal elections.
Mačiulis has not yet had an opportunity to talk to V. Ušackas after he lost the primary elections of the Homeland Union and the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union to Ingrida Šimonytė on Sunday.
"To be honest, we have not yet been able to discuss the results with him and the team in detail and talk about the future plans.
It is clear that after Vygaudas left the next election fight, this stage of my life is over, "- said P. Mačiulis.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas policy for support to V. Ušackas, but regretted that "Lithuania has lost a unique opportunity to have a real leader in the context of international relations."

He is a shareholder of the private school Erudito Lyceum and several other companies.
The workers in Kaunas Castle: what do they do here?
After noticing the workers in Kaunas Castle, the residents of Kaunas were disappointed that the reconstruction works of the surviving tower were finally underway.
Gabriel Sužiedėlis, the director of Kaunas City Museum, told the portal kauno.diena.lt that the works of changing the cover of the protective roofs of the south-western tower with a fragment of the defensive wall are taking place here.
According to the interlocutor, the roofs will be cans.
"The worn tin coating in the emergency condition posed a threat to the surrounding area - people could fall and get injured - so it was necessary to change it.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so this was also detrimental to heritage, "- explained the director of the museum.
Will these roofs be similar to those that existed a few centuries ago?
"All the works are in harmony with heritage and other institutions," he added, seeking to make the result as authentic as possible, but at the same time the practical side is important - the roofs must protect the values from moisture.
When working with heritage, a universal solution was chosen.
Before that, the elements of Kaunas Castle were covered with tin during the Soviet era, so they no longer had historical value, "- detailed the director of Kaunas City Museum.
The contract of work was signed on 2 October.
It is planned that the work will not last longer than three months after the signing of the contract.
"It is expected to be completed by the end of November," the museum's director said.
According to him, the value of the works carried out is almost 24 thousand Euros.
This amount, according to the interlocutor, was provided for in this year's budget.
The works in Kaunas Castle are carried out by the company "Statija."
Kauno. diena.lt has written how, according to the studies carried out, Kaunas Castle may have looked earlier.

The US has 28 500 troops in South Korea.
The two countries have been preparing joint military maneuvers for years, which Pyongyang calls "provocation" and "preparation for invasion."
On Friday, North Korea threatened to renew its nuclear program if Washington does not lift economic sanctions on Pyongyang.
Such a change of course could be "seriously considered," the North Korean foreign ministry said.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with television that criminal measures will remain until Pyongyang renounces nuclear weapons.
At the same time, he announced that he would meet North Korea's envoy, Kim Yong Chol, in New York this week.

Eastern Europe Studies Centre to collaborate with two famous "brain centres" in the US
According to Linas Kojala, the head of EESC, which is based in Vilnius and has been counting for the thirteenth year of its activities, netting in the USA will allow projects to be implemented and will make Lithuania's voice more audible on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We have been working purposefully in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that the two large institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that there will be niches for activities, because the topics we analyse in NATO, security, disinformation and development of Eastern Partnership countries are also a priority for them, "Kojala said.
The agreements note that EESC and US institutions will work together to prepare applications for international projects, exchange expert experience and knowledge, and prepare expert visits.
This should be especially useful for Lithuanian analysts, since both partners have an excellent international reputation.
The FPRI has been operating since 1955 and brings together almost a hundred top analysts.
In the latest global ranking of analytical centres compiled by the University of Pennsylvania, FPRI ranked seventh in its category.
At the time, CEPA, whose analysts have been repeatedly invited to advise and work for the highest political institutions in the United States, is ranked tenth in the same category.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to break into the US information space and encourage us to raise the quality bar up," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be the support of partners in the distribution of the EESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" among US decision makers and in the public space.
The Eastern European Studies Centre operates on the basis of projects implemented and does not retain targeted grants.
EESC partners with which joint initiatives are implemented include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.

Brent Taylor, a 39-year-old mayor of Nort Ogden, north of Salt Lake City, has been on a year-long holiday to carry out a mission in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer at the United Force headquarters, but was due to return to work as mayor in January.
