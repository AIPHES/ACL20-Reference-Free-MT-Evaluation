Mg Baltic case: Gustainis' new lawyer says he has not yet had access to the file
The eleventh hearing of the mg Baltic case on Monday brought together all the defendants: Šarūnas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The hearing began with testimony from the defendants.
At the previous hearing, Mr Gustainis's new lawyer, Alexander Doroshev, appointed by the state, told the panel of judges he had not yet had access to the case file.
At the time, mg Baltic's lawyer Linas Belevičius stated that in order to ensure full personal defense, the panel of judges must allow the new lawyer access to the case file and requested that the hearing be postponed.
“In order to ensure a person's defence, he must have access to the criminal file.
It's not just a formal sitting,” Belevičius said.
The new lawyer, Doroshev, noted that he had not been able to access the indictment or all the material in the case.
At a previous hearing, the suspect, Gustainis, announced that he was abandoning his lawyer because he could no longer pay him.
Audio recordings were also heard at the hearing.
Lawyers for the defendants were outraged that the audio recordings provided to the court were of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that politicians, by taking bribes from mg Baltic, supported or initiated decisions favourable to the group in the Seimas and other state institutions as well as influenced the determination of the winners of public procurement, recalls ELTA.
More than 150 people were interviewed during the pre-trial investigation, more than 50 of whom were members of the previous and current parliamentary term, several former ministers and members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 interviews and more than 30 searches have been carried out.
It is suspected that Mr Gustainis received a bribe of more than 8 thousand euros, Mr Steponavičius received 15 thousand euros and Mr Gapšys received more than 27 thousand. Mr Masiulis is suspected of taking a bribe of more than 106 thousand euros.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trade in influence, the Liberal Movement is suspected of bribery, trade in influence and abuse, and mg Baltic is suspected of bribing these parties and trading in influence.
It is alleged that politicians discussed bribes with R. Kurlianskis, Vice President of mg Baltic Group, and later proposed or supported initiatives favourable to the group in the Seimas or other institutions.
Ethics watchdogs: The Liberal Movement Board is right about the conduct of the Vilnius Division
“The decisions taken by the board comply with the statutes,” its head Vytautas Tamošiūnas said after the commission meeting.
“Our decision was not something new.
We had already made an explanation as a jury in July, when there was a question about Pagegiai and Utena.
Then we said that, according to the statutes, this is a matter of competence for the board.
And if the board decides that some department can do what it wants - go with the committee and the board agrees, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, which the board has adopted, then there is a decision that all departments form party lists.
And if you don't agree with the board, then there's an opportunity to suspend membership and go with the committee,” he added.
According to Tamošiūnas, the party's board will now decide on further actions.
On October 17 th, the Board of the Liberal Movement of the Party annulled the decision of Vilnius City Division to participate in municipal elections not with the list of the party but with the newly assembled electoral committee.
According to the party board, the decision of the capital's liberals to participate in elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's bylaws and board decisions.
By October 31, Vilnius department had to cancel its aspirations to participate in municipal elections with the committee's list.
But the department didn't.
Aussie Armonaitė, a former head of the department, has already withdrawn from the Liberal Movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, former Chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus Šimašius, promising to seek another term as head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee “For Vilnius, which we are proud of!”.
He also left the party.
Elections to municipal councils and mayors will take place in March next year.
Residents of a village in northern India drove a tiger on a tractor that had previously ripped apart one man, officials said Monday.
Forest surveillance officer Mahavier Kaujlagi said that when the tiger tore down a man who worked in the fields late Sunday, villagers surrounded the beast and drove it around in a tractor as the female tried to escape.
Residents say this tiger also attacked and tore down one young man about 10 days ago.
The village in question is located in the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Lakhympur Kher district, about 250 km southeast of Laknau, the capital of Uttar Pradesh state.
The use of tigers in protected areas is prohibited.
Ramesh Pandey, director of the reserve, said the case in question would be reported to police under the Wildlife Conservation Act.
In April, villagers beat another tiger in the Nighasan district of Uttar Pradesh state; he suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is India's national animal; under the Wildlife Conservation Act, tigers are considered an endangered species.
Last year's government figures show at least one person died every day in collisions with wild tigers or elephants over the previous three years.
The number of human conflicts with tigers has been increasing steadily since the 1970 s, when India launched a tiger protection program that established reserves in national parks and started criminalising big cats.
Although the methods of calculating tigers have changed, censuses would indicate that the then population of about 1,800 tigers grew to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
It is proposed that cats and dogs must be labelled with microchips
Chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee Kęstutis Mažeika, together with other Seimas members, has registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, which propose mandatory labelling of cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips.
“We propose that cats and dogs must be labelled with subcutaneous microchips and that their registration and labelling be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
All dogs will be labelled free of charge in 2019 and cats in 2020, so residents will not be concerned and the costs will be covered by specially planned state funding,” said Kęstutis Mažeika, chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee.
Amendments to the law aim to address the systemic need for pet labelling.
It is hoped this will help to avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal propagators or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that, based on the expected average cost of providing a chip and service of around EUR 5, all animal owners will be compensated during the transitional period.
The total cost of labelling all pets can be up to €6 million.
The need for these funds is planned to spread over three years, reaching EUR 2 million annually.
The funding for labelling programmes is expected to be channelled through the Municipal Environment Support Special Programme, whose revenues will increase significantly this year due to increased taxes on natural resources and redistribution of funds.
These funds will be available to municipalities not only for the labelling of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programmes.
According to K. Mažeika, the practice of compulsory labelling is common in almost all countries of the European Union, which allows to protect both the animals themselves (because lost ones can easily be returned to owners) and saves the time of the animal breeders themselves, when it takes a lot of time and money to find an escaped and lost pet.
In addition, EU legislation provides that only marked pets are allowed to travel.
At the same time, labelling obliges responsible care for the animal throughout its life.
Previous proposals for compulsory labelling have been met with resistance as the programmes concerned have been proposed for funding from the population.
“The current model should avoid this criticism, as animal protection is proposed to be funded through increased revenues in the Environmental Support Programme and the right to label not only veterinarians but also the public, i.e. individuals in animal care institutions who have taken special courses at the Veterinary Academy,” the authors of the project say.
The bill was registered by a group of Seimas members representing different Seimas Groups - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmund Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 members of government forces killed in Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
Arif Noori, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that four other soldiers were wounded in the attack on a joint army and police checkpoint in Khogjani district.
According to Noori, six militants were killed and ten other Taliban wounded in a three-hour battle with Afghan forces.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement to the media in which the movement claimed responsibility for Monday's attack in Gazni province.
Mr Noori said the post was installed two days ago in a strategically important area to cut off the Taliban supply route.
The post was completely destroyed in the attack.
Morning reached out to the Ukrainian club for help
The FIBA European Cup fourth round matches will take place on Wednesday at Vilnius' East Arena, where clubs from Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
The battle will be held in the capital for political reasons.
Vilnius Rytas, which has a warm relationship with Ukrainian basketball, will host Cherkaski Mavpy and Pristina KB Prishtina teams under its roof at the East Arena on November 7.
“For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we were unable to host this match at home, so we are very pleased that our Vilnius friends have agreed to accept us,” Ukrainian head coach Maksim Michelson said.
- We have many friends in Vilnius, and our countries always get along well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the best basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honour for us to play here.
We hope that we will get support from the villagers.
Kosovo's team was unable to enter Ukraine because these countries do not have any diplomatic relations.
The Ukrainian squad currently ranks third after the first round with one victory in three meetings, while the Kosovo team is in second position and has more victory.
This will be a crucial confrontation for Group E as only two teams will enter the next stage.
In the past, Vilnius has also hosted matches between Ukrainian and Kosovo teams in selection for the 2017 European Basketball Championship.
Then, at 100:61, the Ukrainian team celebrated the victory.
Basketball fans will be able to enter the game for free on Wednesday and the start of the battle will be 19 p.m.
“Women lie better” star actress Arsobaite is haunted by liars
It's probably just a coincidence, but gorgeous brown-eyed actress Brigita Arsobaite has been getting roles related to liars for several generations.
First the series “Women Lies Better,” then the performance “Liars” and finally the comedy “Liars.”
In this film, Brigitte plays the square wife of the hero of Dainius Kazlauskas.
“I loved filming “Liars” because I'm more of a theater actress and I rarely appear in cinema.
The wonderful team of colleagues gathered promised a great result from the start.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the pitch was puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought if I had a dog it would be really big and serious.
I've never admired those little, ornamental Fifa four-legged ones.
But during filming, Sunny became so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and eventually I even wanted to buy it from my mistress, but unsuccessfully,” the actress smiles.
New Lithuanian comedy “Liars”, produced by Lithuanian film hits “Inexperienced” and “Between Us, Boys...” producer Paulius Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionov, is entering the comic and intriguing periphery of family members from the first minutes.
Your lover just announced she's pregnant.
It would be great news, but... your lover is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Before everyone can announce the “good news,” parents suddenly declare that they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this is happening just before the most beautiful celebrations of the year - Christmas!
But the end will be even more surprising because no one expected such an atom.
All the heroes are not what they looked like at first sight...
Besides B. Arsobaitė in the comedy “Liars”, four-time film stars will give the audience a good mood: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Lubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
The comedy “Liars” has been in cinemas since November 9.
Decide whether to write off €100 million in unpaid taxes for emigrants
The Seimas adopted on Tuesday an amendment to the Law on Declaration of Residence prepared by the leader of “peasants” Ramūnas Karbauskis.
56 members of the Seimas voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstentions.
The Seimas will proceed with the consideration of amendments on or after December 6, following the conclusion of the Government.
According to R. Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarian, one person does not pay about 1 thousand euros in three years, and now there are about 100 thousand.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sessions regretted that in this way the parliament would “urge some people not to abide by their obligations” - declare their departure and then no taxes would be calculated.
Conservative member of the Health Affairs Committee Antanas Matulas noted that Lithuanians living abroad take advantage of the fact that they come to Lithuania for treatment by paying a small health insurance fee - they are provided the same services as residents who pay this tax.
The amendments provide that persons who will pay social security contributions in the countries of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation will be considered to have left Lithuania, while Sodra will have exempted them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
The head of Sodra Mindaugas Sinkevičius has previously said that such a move will facilitate both the lives of the emigrated people and the activities of Sodra.
Video of a sliding teddy bear circulating online reveals a serious problem
A mother bear is filmed climbing a steep snowy slope while the baby keeps climbing, slipping down and stubbornly climbing again.
The video has received numerous views and comments.
People admired the perseverance of the little bear - repeatedly slipping down, he climbed back to his mother.
He doesn't succeed for the first time, but the baby doesn't even try to give up and finally reaches his goal.
The video does belong to attention, but it also reveals the threat that humans pose to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people's desire to know wildlife can sometimes be harmful.
'It's obvious to me that the bears were very frightened by the drone.
Their movements show that they are panicking.
If a drone didn't fly around, they would probably have chosen a safer path or overcome it more slowly or cautiously.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used,” ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago, Ditmer and his colleagues studied how drones affect bears.
The animals were fitted with cardiac gauges.
When the drone approached, some bears ran, others didn't run anywhere, but their hearts started beating more often with fear.
Scientists advise that drones should be used responsibly to film animals, not fly too close, not make noise or fly where it is prohibited.
Contacted by the escaped president via a newspaper
A Kiev court on Tuesday summoned ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, who had retired to Russia, to appear at a hearing of the case over his alleged state treason in an unusual way - a summons published in the state's Official Journal.
In a court summons published in the government news newspaper Uriadovoj Courier, the former leader is invited to appear at a criminal trial hearing on November 19 to hear his closing arguments.
The document states that Yanukovych has the right to attend the meeting via video link.
On October 30, a Kiev court announced that it had closed the debate in Yanukovych's case.
Yanukovych's lawyer Alexander Goroshinsky, who works in Russia, was given the opportunity to register with a register of foreign lawyers by November 19 so he could attend a hearing where Yanukovych is expected to say his last word via video link.
Kremlin-backed Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the president's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader had been taken to Russia in a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, and later a war broke out in the east of the country between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists.
Since then, the fighting has killed about 10 thousand people, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a lasting ceasefire.
Valdas Benkunskas will lead the list of conservatives to Vilnius City Council
A former economy minister, MP Dainius Kreivys, has already been confirmed as the Conservative candidate for the year.
During the Conservative primary elections over the weekend, party members ranked the list of candidates for Vilnius City Municipality Council.
According to the party, the leader of the conservative list was V. Benkunskas, chairman of the US-LKD Vilnius Division Assembly.
The first ten candidates included Vilnius City Municipality Council members Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adomas Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Baškienė, former Seimas member Lutauras Kazlavickas, Chairman of the Young Conservatives League Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karazijaitė.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on 3 March next year.
Restrictions on cogeneration plants appealed to the Constitutional Court
The Seimas opposition, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (CT) against the decision of the governors to pass a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition faction of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that a group of Seimas members had appealed to the CT to investigate the compliance of the amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by the governors with the Constitution.
“MEPs emphasize that the provisions of the law aim to question the current projects of waste incineration plants, instructing the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km from the residential area) until the entry into force of the law on waste incineration plants started in Vilnius and Kaunas,” the report reads.
“MEPs note that, in view of the way in which the law formulates a prohibition on the construction of objects of national importance for waste management (i.e. the determination of distance and definition of the concept of “residential area”), it must be concluded that this prohibition disproportionately restricts or even denies the very essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for energy production, since the established criteria are formulated in such a way that, taking into account the density and distribution of the population of Lithuania, it would be practically impossible to construct such facilities throughout the territory of the country,” it adds.
The petition states that the adopted law is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
“The CT has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to the legal facts and consequences that occurred prior to the entry into force of the newly adopted legal act.
In this case, the government is given the power to apply the law back on the basis of an unspecified criterion.
Such legal regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations and therefore the constitutional principle of the rule of law,” the petition states.
It also notes that major financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration plants.
The suspension of current projects would not only result in hundreds of millions of financial losses for the state, huge losses for the Lithuanian population as well - increase heating prices and increase environmental pollution due to the increasing amount of waste disposal in landfills.
The appeal to the CT was signed by members from the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Movement, the Social Democratic groups and the deputy head of the ruling Social Democratic Labour Group Algirdas Butkevičius.
A couple of weeks ago, the parliament managed to gather 71 votes by the votes of the governors to reject amendments to the Waste Management Law passed by President Dalia Grybauskaite's veto, which provides for the government's right to halt the construction of cogeneration plants that have already begun, as well as establishing a “quarantine” zone of 20 km from residential areas for the construction of such power plants.
Amendments to the law re-adopted by the Seimas will come into force from 1 January 2019. It is true that the rulers are already proposing to abandon the 20 km limit.
This proposal is scheduled to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, there are no plans to waive the government's right to suspend projects that have already begun.
The CT will hear the case in a row - no sooner than a year later.
Publicized LeBron James' questionable statistics at Lakers
LeBron James' career start at the Los Angeles Lakers is not what he, the organization and basketball fans expected.
The Lakers started the season with four wins and six defeats, and such a weak start helped lead to rumors of a possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
Still, such talk was reassured by the president of basketball operations, Magiz Johnson, who said he would not fire the coach but that he needed to play better.
James, the team's biggest star, should also turn to himself.
Although the attacker's statistics are typically impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 rebounds.
But she doesn't tell the whole truth.
Other figures have emerged in the first ten games of the season showing the Lakers are playing better when James is not on the field.
The attacker is not favored by +/- statistics showing how many points more are thrown or missed by the squad when there are certain players on the field.
Here, when James is on the field, the Lakers have missed 30 points more than their rivals this season.
As he sat on the bench, the Lakers scored 19 points more than their rivals.
The Lakers are currently in just 13 th place in the Western Conference, but a few victories can turn things upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
“Lithuania greatly appreciates Spain's cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and region,” Minister Linkevičius said.
The Spanish Air Force has already conducted NATO air policing and air policing reinforcement missions in the Baltic States five times, including three times in Lithuania.
Spain's Eurofighter fighter jets were last deployed in the North between May and August this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations are taking place between Lithuania and Spain on security, political, economic and strategic communication issues in the fight against propaganda.
Linkevičius expressed hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to work closely together on the European, transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.
Since Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius in 2004, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga has been Spain's fifth representative in Lithuania.
On October 29, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented letters of credence to President Dalia Grybauskaite.
V. Ačienė on the detention of R. Ačas: I believe in the innocence and law enforcement of the man
'For me, it was the most unexpected thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, I guess the services are doing the job they have to do.
We're all doing our job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is right and fair, that no unfair actions by him should be done,” Ačienė said.
Mr Ačas was arrested by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday - law enforcement suspects he took a high-value bribe while still director of the Raseiniai Municipal Administration, and in return could create exceptional conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the municipality-owned Raseiniai Bus Park.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly bribing Mr Ach or of being involved in masquerading bribes in various financial operations.
In April this year, the Raseiniai District Municipal Council dismissed R. Ačas as head of the administration in a third attempt after expressing distrust.
The former “bandmate” became a member of the newly founded Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminas Kirkilo in March this year, and he suspended membership of the party on Monday.
Mr Ačas unsuccessfully in the mayoral election a few years ago as a spokesman for the election committee Your Raseiniai.
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to nominate himself in the election of Raseiniai mayor next year, but had not yet decided whether he would participate in municipal council elections.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas with the List of Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union and is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says she will wait for further law enforcement action - which will determine whether she steps down from her job on the commission.
'I'm definitely not making sudden decisions today, I think I'll make a decision this week.
I will see if there is a need, what the charges are, of course I will make some sort of decision.
I guess I need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again, it's going to put everything in place,” she said.
The representative of opposition conservatives in the Seimas Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė called on the Speaker of the Seimas Viktor Pranckietis and the head of “peasants” Ramūnas Karbauskis to distance themselves from the statements of the group's colleague Vida Ačienė and withdraw her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission by transferring her to another Seimas committee or commission.
She argues that the continued work of V. Ačienė in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission would “create a public-based distrust and discredit the work of an important parliamentary oversight commission.”
Coldplay's sensual music has also attracted famous Lithuanian couples
On an autumn Monday night, many music and film lovers gathered for the pre-premiere of the film Coldplay: a Head Full of Dreams.
A whole bunch of famous people came to the event: John and Simona Nainiai, Ignas Lelys, Martin Silence and many others.
The film tells the story of Coldplay, one of Britain's most popular pop-up groups, which intertwines with moments from concerts.
Documentary director Matt Whitecross met the band's guys back when they were still playing in bars and gathering just a few dozen viewers.
The film shows shots from behind the scenes of concerts, rehearsals or leisure.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met in 1996 at college and founded the Pectoralz group.
They were soon joined by bossist Guy Berryman and, a little later, drummer Will Champion.
The band changed its name to Coldplay and exactly twenty years ago released its first record, Safety, which contained three works.
Of the 500 copies of the recording, most were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, and only 50 copies of Safety went on sale.
Coldplay is now a world-renowned, respected and beloved band that has released seven albums with more than 100 million copies sold.
Over two decades, the group has won 107 different awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.
Čepukaitis, who led Juventus to victory, is MVP of LKL Week
Utena Juventus tall Vaidas Čepukaitis, who played a solid match at Betsafe-LKL, earned the title of the most useful player of the week.
The centre scored a double bowl, which helped the Juventus team beat the Alytus Dzukija players in an extension of 86:77.
In almost 31 minutes played, Čepukaitis scored 13 points (5/6 points) and rebounded 11 balls.
In addition, the tall man provoked 7 fouls from his opponents, intercepted 3 balls and made 4 effective transfers.
Such indicators guaranteed 30 points of utility.
Čepukaitis scores 17.2 points each this season, which is the best indicator of his career in playing his 11 th season in the LKL.
Tall is the fourth most valuable player this season.
Along with Vytautas Čepukaitis, Martynas Gecevičius and Kšištofas Lavrinovičius (both of whom are Prienai Skycop), Yannick Franke (Pasvalys Milk Stars) and Jerai Grant (Klaipeda Neptune) were among the top five of the week.
It was only recently that Franke, a Legionnaire who joined Pasvale's team, dropped 24 points, rebounded 10 balls and provoked 8 opponents' fouls in an 88:93 losing match with the Prienai Skycop, scoring as many as 31 utility points.
However, he was prevented from becoming the most useful player of the week by the team's defeat.
The defensive circuit in the top five with the Legionnaire of the Pasvalys team consists of his opponent of the day - Gecevich, who represents the Prienai Crews.
He scored 19 points and rebounded 9 balls.
Such indicators guaranteed the sniper 26 points of utility.
Another Skycop player can also be seen at the high level - Lavrinovic had 15 points in Sunday's game (3/4, 9/11), provoked 7 fouls from his rivals and scored 23 utility points.
Klaipeda Neptune attacker J.Grant, who played a powerful game in Vilnius, was also in the top five.
The American dropped 25 points (10/11) in 25 minutes, rebounded 4, intercepted 3 balls, and thus accumulated 29 points of utility.
Such a performance by the legionnaire allowed the skippers in the capital to triumph over the local “Morning” at 78:66.
The highest incidence of flu is in one of the big cities
Flu and acute upper respiratory tract infections (oozing) fell across the country last week.
According to data of the Centre for Communicable Diseases and AIDS (ULAC), between October 29 and November 4, Lithuania's total flu and obesity incidence rate was 49.9 cases per 10 thousand inhabitants.
In the previous week, the figure was 68.1 cases per 10 thousand inhabitants.

Palestinian who attacked Israelis with knife shot in West Bank
The soldier “prevented this attack because he identified a terrorist who tried to strike civilians and an IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) officer with a knife,” according to a report released by the Israeli Army about the incident at the Kirjat Arba settlements near Hebron.
“The soldier opened fire on the terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to hospital.
Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers were not hurt,” the report adds.
An army spokeswoman told AFP news agency that the attack was attempted by a Palestinian.
Video footage taken after the incident shows he was lightly injured.
A wave of similar Palestinian attacks began in 2015.
Such attacks have declined in recent years, but there are fears there could be a new wave of them.
A Palestinian man was shot dead on October 22 after attacking a group of Jewish soldiers near Hebron with a knife.
Grybauskaite calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for investments by European Union (EU) countries and to facilitate foreign import conditions.
Opening a trade and investment forum at the China Import Expo in Shanghai, Grybauskaite stressed that, seeing signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to “unite efforts to stop the spread of protectionism in the world,” targeting the root causes of tensions, “overproduction and unfair competition” caused by trade wars.
“The European Union attaches great importance to China's commitment to creating a more attractive, open environment for investment, which is important when negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to complete this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business feels welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening protection of intellectual property,” Grybauskaite said.
According to her, China's opening up is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The President underlined that transparency of investments must be “above the interests of any business group”.
“Transparency, the rule of law, strict compliance with international treaties - this must be essential for the environment of new investment relations,” Grybauskaite emphasized.
“Corrupt capital flows should not be welcome in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries,” she added.
China's import exhibition is trying to soften criticism that it is avoiding opening up its market and protesting only its companies.
The exhibition is attended by several heads of state, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions around the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, China currently ranks 25 th among export partners.
Last year, Lithuania's exports to China grew by 50%, reaching 180 million euros.
At the same time, imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials worry that China's investment in Lithuania could bring unwanted political influence, while Beijing's exclusive focus on Eastern Europe is dividing EU unity.
Inconvenience solved: Mobile signature service is already running
Estonian it company SK ID Solutions, a provider of mobile signatures, reports that the failure of the mobile signature system has been removed and the service is operating as normal.
The mobile signature restarted at 14.28 a.m.

The cause of the Lion Air plane crash has been revealed: relatives of those killed are angry
Data from the black box of the crashed Indonesian airline Lion Air's liner show that at least four of its last flights showed a malfunction in the performance of the speed gauge, investigators said Monday.
Soerjanto Tjahjono, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee (ntsk), said a similar riot occurred during the plane's last four flights, including the fatal one when the liner fell in the Java Sea on October 29 shortly after taking off from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board were killed in this crash.
Many media reported problems during the previous Boeing 737 max 8 flight from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
“When we opened the black box - yes, actually the technical problem was the speed in the air, in other words the speed of the plane,” Tjahjono said at a press conference.
“Black box data showed that Denpasar-Jakarta was also the same problem during the two pre-flight flights,” he added.
“There are a lot of rumors on social networks.
Now we want to explain that there were four flights in the black box (data remained) where there were problems with the speed meter in the air,” the head of the ntsk said.
During a meeting with members of the families of those killed, Mr Tjahjono said the information from the device recording flight data was consistent with reports that its speed and altitude had changed erratically as the plane took off on its last flight.
Search teams have not yet found a second black box recording conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air pointed out that when a technical fault was detected on a flight from Bali to Jakarta, it was repaired in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
Rusdi Kirana, one of the company's founders, was not invited to speak by Transport Minister Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated a meeting of family members with officials overseeing the search for the plane and the remains of the victims and the investigation into the crash.
But he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Mr Kirana, who co-founded Lion Air with his brother Kusnan in 1999, introduce himself.
“Lion Air acted improperly,” said one man who identified himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island where the plane was headed.
“I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention,” he said.
'Since the start of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air showed us no compassion. ”
After that meeting, Mr Kirana left hastily, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of a lengthy process of identifying the dead.
Nearly 140 body bags loaded with parts of human remains have been handed over to police medical experts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives questioned why the liner, which was launched two months ago, was allowed to fly, although a malfunction occurred on the October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, including causing passengers to be frightened by a sudden drop in the plane shortly after take-off.
Lion Air said the crash had been rectified.
“Is it true that the problem has been solved?” asked the son of one of the dead.
- If not, the technicians concerned must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, not they said the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must be held accountable by law so that plane crashes in Indonesia do not happen again.
Mr Tjahjono said the large amount of small debris and the fact that the wreckage spread over a relatively small area indicate that the liner likely crashed into the water at very high speeds.
“The plane was seamless when it fell into the sea.
It did not explode in the air and the plane's engines were operating in large turns when it touched the water - as shown by all the broken turbine blades,” the official explained.
The Lion Air liner crash is the worst aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people were killed when a Garuda plane crashed near Medan.
Rescuers commanded from the wreckage after the crash: a minor was also hurt
BMW and Mercedes-Benz collided at Tilwick on Monday night.
The cars collided with a cactus and three people were reported injured.
The BMW driver, who was born in 1999, reportedly drove to the opposite side of traffic and crashed into a Mercedes-Benz car with his dad, who was born in 1967, and his daughter, who was born in 2005.
The driver of the BMW was rescued from the wreckage by firefighters - rescuers.
The girl from Mercedes-Benz had her teeth knocked out in the crash.
All the victims have been taken to hospital.
Presidential Palace: There is no need for artificial facilitation on the referendum
After the parliament approved a proposal by the governors to reduce the referendum cartels for the first chapter of the Constitution, which currently has greater protection, the president will veto the amendments, says her adviser Mindaugas Lingė.
“More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that is the requirement.
This and its amendment, especially the articles in its first section, should certainly be at least as much.
It's easy to predict that the president would definitely veto,” Dalia Grybauskaite's domestic policy adviser told News Radio on Tuesday.
He emphasized that the first section of the Constitution defines the basic things of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty - so reducing the number of votes necessary to amend these articles would create a “negative precedent” and “open up uncontrollable risks,” according to Linge.
“In the President's view, no artificial facilitation is needed, more preparation is needed for the referendum itself, more dialogue with people is needed,” he said.
The Seimas plans to vote on Tuesday on the adoption of an amendment to the Law on Referendum.
It provides that a decision on amendments to the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution having higher protection shall be taken if at least two-fifths of the citizens entitled to vote approve it during the referendum.
Currently, more than half of all citizens who have the right to vote can change articles of the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution by referendum.
About 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote in Lithuania: half would be 1.25 million voters, two-fifths would be one million voters.
This proposal was born after the parliament approved the president's veto in September on amendments previously passed in parliament that relaxed the requirements for the number of votes by changing Article 12 of Section One of the Constitution, which defines citizenship.
The cartel is proposed to be reduced in the run-up to the referendum on dual citizenship and is due to take place on May 12 and May 26 next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential election are planned.
Those who emigrated after the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990 cannot currently have dual citizenship, with some exceptions.
Dual citizenship is sought by the world's Lithuanian community, but fears that under the current conditions a referendum would not take place - a sufficient number of people would not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports are “strawberry” and need to be updated
Lithuania's airport and road infrastructure is starting to strain, so it needs to be upgraded, says Transport Minister Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renovation of Vilnius airport is the minimum task that the state must carry out.
“The air transport infrastructure is already strawberry because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renovate Vilnius airport - it is not even part of long-term planning, it is the minimum we must do,” Mr. Masiulis said at a transport conference organized by the Foundation for Democratic Development and the journal State on Tuesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be crucial because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the construction of Klaipėda external port, the renovation of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, or perhaps the construction of a new airport.
“The next decade will be very important - we must complete road, rail integration, construction of an external port in Klaipėda, clean up airports, perhaps decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, we must already start projects that will reach our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years,” the Transport Minister said.
Mr. Masiulis reiterated that there has been too little funding for road maintenance in recent years.
'The state of the roads is not improving yet because there is not enough funding available.
We are able to build new roads, but even for essential maintenance, such as on highways, there is a lack of funds.
We must determine the amount to be spent on road maintenance if we want their condition to improve,” Mr. Masiulis said.
He stressed that exports of services in the Lithuanian transport sector grew by 18.6% this year, while Germany became the largest export market, ahead of Russia.
Mr Masiulis again criticised the European Commission's proposal, which would require EU carriers to return tractors periodically to the country of registration.
“We must make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the suggestion that tractors should return home permanently is absurd, because empty trucks would drive in Europe, burn fuel, and increase emissions.
Railways will win the most from this, as costs will increase to such an extent that some transport will shift to railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions,” Mr. Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the transport sector accounts for 12.2%.
Lithuania's gross domestic product (GDP).
It has more than 118,000 employees and more than 7,500 companies.
Dispute with heirs
Last week, Mr. Masiulis announced in the Seimas Economic Committee that he had started negotiations on changing the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building, which would allow the demolition of the old terminal and the construction of a new one.
However, Algimantas Degutis, interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (CPD), called Mr. Masiulis's deliberations political pressure.
According to him, the building, built in the 1950 s, is a value entered in the register in 1993, and it is not for politicians but for professionals to decide on its removal.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving Lithuania's image.
“Taking that old terminal out of the heritage would be a politically important step to be able to demolish it and build a new modern arrival terminal so that when you arrive in Vilnius you feel in a modern country, not so interesting, really unrepresentative of our country as innovative,” Mr. Masiulis said in parliament last week.
Mr. Masiulis also announced at the time that it was planned to build a brand new passenger terminal in Kaunas and connect the airport to the Rail Baltica track by building an underground station.
This transport hub is expected to operate in 2026 after the completion of the construction of Rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, 4.8 million passengers are expected this year and 5 million next year.
Kaunas airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers last year.
What are Lithuanian troops doing in Afghanistan?
The BNS shall provide the tasks they carry out.
A total of nearly 50 Lithuanian soldiers are serving in Afghanistan.
Kabul.
The headquarters of Kabul International Airport in the Afghan capital is served by soldiers of the logistical pram element, serving all Lithuanians stationed in the country, organizing visits and rotations of soldiers.
This headquarters is also served by two Lithuanian Special Operations Forces soldiers, who ensure the interaction of NATO mission command and combat support with “specs” in Kandahar.
Military policemen, who oversee public order, serve at the headquarters of NATO's “Strong Support” mission.
Officers of the Lithuanian Headquarters shall serve at the same headquarters.
They are responsible for intelligence, operations, planning and logistics.
Kandahar.
About 30 Lithuanian Special Operations Forces soldiers are serving in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.
They train a local police special operations unit, where about 150 Afghans serve.
Officers are trained by SOP soldiers at or outside their own training sites.
The “kites” are also assisted by an Air Force soldier who operates unmanned aircraft.
Herat.
The headquarters in this city in the northwest of Afghanistan are served by staff officers.
They work on boards responsible for military training, logistics, intelligence, operations and planning.
Start direct flights to Madagascar from Vilnius next year
Next spring, the largest scheduled passenger plane Boeing 767 will land at Vilnius airport, which will fly travellers from Lithuania directly to the island of Bee belonging to Madagascar, according to information from tour operator Itaka Lietuva, according to the portal madeinvilnius.lt.
It is announced that Blue Panorama airline passengers will be able to choose from 259 economic class and 8 business class seats.
The new holiday destination will be available directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominic Milowski, CEO of Itaka Lietuva, says he is trying to offer tourists from Lithuania new holiday destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
Other tour operators have also developed new holiday destinations for the 2019 summer season.
For example, Novaturas and Itaka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Finance Minister on possible crisis: it is important not to persuade illness
'We always have to prepare for tougher times.
What I want to enjoy is that for the third year in a row, for the first time in Lithuania's history, we are building up reserves.
But also a very important thing is not to persuade the disease,” Shapoka said during a visit to Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, Finance Minister and Deputy Minister Miglė Tuskienė participates in meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting addresses issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed that an agreement be reached on how revenues from the provision of certain digital services in EU Member States should be taxed until there is a global consensus.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On October 23, the EC rejected Italy's draft budget as not meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time the EC has taken advantage of this opportunity.
Further information was requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss deepening the Economic and Monetary Union: the feasibility of implementing the European Deposit Insurance Scheme and reforms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports the stronger role of the ESM in financial assistance programmes, but it is considered that the functions of the ESM need to be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of functions between the ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Burach.
Lithuanian labour traditions and customs
Recently, it was 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural yearbook, ethnographer and landscape researcher Bali Buračas (1897-1972) in Sidariai, Šiaulėnai valley, then the governorate of Šiauliai.
As we celebrate the 100 th anniversary of the Lithuanian state, we have a great opportunity to remember how the life-breathing national revival has called many Lithuanian people, including the Buračus brothers - Bali, John, Bronius - from the very depths of the village to engage in the promotion, embrace and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Burach, who has traveled around his home country with a camera in his hands in more than 50 years, provided a wide and realistic picture of our country's customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing folds of national culture and had a rare ability to grasp the survival value of his work.
In Bali Buračas photographs, Lithuania's landscape, hills, and our people, perpetuated in the environment of everyday life and holidays, decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines in national costumes.
This publication contains a significant part of Bali Burach's legacy for describing national working customs and related traditions and, above all, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and a heavy occupation.
The manuscript of the book is particularly rich in the works of the inhabitants of the inter-war Zemaitia, especially the fringes, the northerners, the tellers, as well as the people of Aukštaitija and Dzūkija, their celebrations and other traditions and customs written by Bali Burach.
Of the approximately 10,000 negatives retained in museums and archives, over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photographs were selected for this publication, grouped according to the selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture that are characteristic of fringes, dzukes, other districts of Aukštaitija and Žemaitijos.
A handcuffed suspect who escaped from a police car in Panevėžys stayed in jail for 4 hours
How the young man (born in 1994) managed to escape from the service car has not yet been revealed by officials.
He was brought into custody on suspicion of theft.
Around 16 a.m., police circulated a picture of the fugitive and appealed to the public for help: “Dalius Malakauskas (born 1994), a Burmese suspected of theft, fled the service car.
The person fled in handcuffs.
If you notice this person, please contact 112 or 8700 60000.
Replenished.

Thank you all for your help.
The couple's tragic fate: They died after just hours of marriage
A couple of newlyweds married just hours earlier have died in a helicopter crash in the southwest of the US state of Texas.
William Troy Byler, 24, and his fellow wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler were killed Sunday shortly after midnight when a helicopter crashed into a hill 16 km northwest of Juvaldi and 129 km west of San Antonio, local peace judge Steven Kennedy said.
Surprisingly, the accident happened after flying about 24 kilometres, just as the newlyweds were years old.
Helicopter pilot Gerald Douglas Lawrence, 76, also died.
The newlyweds studied at Sam Houston State University, based in Huntsville, Texas.
They married on Saturday evening at the Byler family ranch near Juvaldi and flew out in a family-owned helicopter after the wedding celebration.
The accident occurred when the helicopter flew about 24 kilometres.
The newlyweds flew to Sant Antonio International Airport, where they intended to board a plane and fly for a honeymoon, Kennedy said, without specifying the couple's final destination.
“It's a very rocky, uneven terrain area, and that hill is about 120 to 150 metres high,” Mr Kennedy said.
Mr Lawrence has piloted the aircraft of that family for many years.
According to Mr Kennedy, he piloted helicopters and served in Vietnam.
The autopsy should reveal what the pilot's physical condition was and whether it could have been the cause of the crash.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after take-off.
Its debris glowed wide on a rocky hillside and the hull remained “dangerously hanging,” flight safety investigator Craig Hatch from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said at a press conference on Monday.
Investigators intend to remove the wreckage and then thoroughly inspect it, but it won't be easy for the tractor and truck to reach that location, he said.
The cause of the crash has not yet been determined and a preliminary NTSB report is expected to be released in two weeks.
Israeli prime minister calls entry into force of new sanctions against Iran a 'historic day'
“Today is a historic day,” Netanyahu told MPs of his Likud party, his office said.
“Today is the day when under President (Donald) Trump, the US imposes particularly tough sanctions on Iran, the toughest sanctions on Iran in all the time that efforts to curb its aggression have begun,” the Israeli government chief said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would strike a “decisive” blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls the “toughest sanctions ever,” came after Trump's May and controversial decision to withdraw from the world powers agreement with Tehran over its nuclear program.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which have already fallen by about a million barrels per day since May, and cut Tehran off from international funding.
Israel has long opposed the agreement with Iran and says its scope and deadlines are too limited.
The Jewish state also says the lifting of sanctions has enabled Iran to fund militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighboring Syria and has promised to prevent it from establishing itself there militarily.
Other participants in the treaty with Iran - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - oppose the US decision and say the agreement, as intended, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
Court again dives into the circumstances surrounding the death of a young motorcyclist
In the case of an accident that ended in the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, Northtown, the court will hear testimony from a witness.
Vilnius District Court ruled on Tuesday that one of the witnesses in the case will be questioned at the next hearing on November 26 in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case.
An acquittal has already been handed down in this case but is not accepted by the prosecution.
On August 22, Vilnius City District Court acquitted the driver of the car of a fatal motorcyclist accident by declaring 79-year-old Eduardo Osipov that the motorcyclist was driving at high speed in the city and committed a serious violation.
The Vilnius District Attorney's Office is asking the district court to overturn the district court's verdict and says that Osipov is the biggest culprit in the accident, and the district court's findings are unfounded.
An attorney for the family of the dead motorcyclist is also asking for the acquittal to be overturned.
The crash occurred around 15 a.m. on August 11, 2015, when the Skoda Fabia, driven by Osipov, drove from Lakunai Street into Zirmūnai Street and collided with a motorcycle on the main road.
The prosecution charged the man that the driver of the car had violated road traffic rules intended to give way and caused a traffic accident, killing a man on the main road on the Piaggo motorcycle.
Initial police reports indicated that the scooter driver had died, but later after investigations, the vehicle was found to be equivalent to a motorcycle in terms of power.
Judge Rolandas Bužinskas of Vilnius District Court has said that experts have determined that the motorcycle driver was travelling at 89.2 kilometres per hour, although the permissible speed at that location is 50 kilometres per hour.
“The driver of the car could not have foreseen that the motorcycle would be travelling at such a high speed,” the judge said.
At the time, the driver of the honourable car claimed to have been travelling at just 5-6 kilometres per hour.
The motorcycle driver who saw the barrier tried to brake and fell off the vehicle before colliding with the Scoda Fabia.
The prosecution believes Mr Osipov, who was travelling from side to main road, should have given way to the motorcyclist.
Novaya Gazeta: Six Wagner mercenaries killed in Syria
Among those killed are five Syrian troops and six individuals belonging to the military company Wagner.
This is announced by a Novaya Gazeta source in Syria.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5 th Syrian Army Corps is stationed in the area, joined by a number of Syrian volunteers and “military mercenaries.”
Novaya Gazeta has sent a request to Russia's foreign ministry for information on the fate of the Russians.
The former king of Belgium will have to undergo a paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking recognition as the former monarch's child since 2013.
The 50-year-old woman claims her mother Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II had a significant love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies parenthood.
According to the station RTBF, he can go to the Supreme Court in opposition to DNA testing.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel - the ex-husband of Delphine's mother - is neither biologically nor legally the artist's father.
Delphine applied for an appropriate investigation so that the daughter of “real” father Albert could be recognised.
The CEC will distribute money to the parties, but will give nothing to the Socialists
The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) is set to distribute a budget grant of nearly €3 million to major political parties this week.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (lsdp), which was established this spring and led by the parliament's vice-president Gediminas Kirkilo, is not yet scheduled to receive funds from the budget.
But they may be awarded in the near future by a separate decision of the CEC if the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to parties changes.
Laura Matjošaitytė, Chair of the CEC, informed the GC that “a meeting of the commission is scheduled for this Thursday, where a decision is planned on the allocation of the budget's semi-annual grant to the parties.”
She said the CEC had until 15 November to make a decision on the matter.
It is planned to allocate EUR 2,751 million to seven parties, six of which are parliamentary.
The opposition Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats are expected to receive more than 0.66 million euros, the ruling Union of the States and Greens - about 0.55 million euros, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about 0.5 million euros, the opposition Liberal Movement - nearly 0.4 million euros, the Labour Party, which does not have its own faction in parliament - about 0.23 million euros, the recently-joined Party of Order and Justice - almost 0.22 million euros.
Under the current law, which will guide the Central Committee in allocating budget money, grants are awarded to parties which meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
As a result, the current legal regulation does not allow the lsdp, which was set up this spring, to expect to receive money from the budget.
For this party has not yet taken part in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that the Socialists receive at least a couple hundred thousand euros in the run-up to three elections next year - municipal, presidential and European Parliament.
The corresponding amendments adopted by the Seimas to the Political Parties and this year's budget laws were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The parliament has not yet decided on this veto, but Mr. Kirkilas, the ruling representatives, and Ramūnas Karbauskis, the leader of the peasant-Greens, believe that parliamentarians will seek to reject the president's objections.
However, this will not be possible before this Thursday's meeting of the Central Committee, so according to Mr. Matjošaitytė, “grants will be allocated according to the legal order that has existed so far.”
However, the head of the Central Committee did not rule out that if the parliament rejected the president's veto this week or next week and a new amendment on the allocation of budget funds to parties came into force, a decision on the allocation of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the lsddp, could be considered in the commission.
“When making a decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in place because we are an executive body that has to implement the laws that are being passed,” she said.
If the parliament were able to reject the veto and the new laws came into force, it would make additional money available to the parties by the government, which has borrowed the corresponding amounts in addition.
Grants already allocated to seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

Poroshenko: Customers of the murder of activist Handziuk must be punished
'I want to state that no version - and more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each will be scrutinised very carefully in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As president, I have no opportunity and no obligation to obtain information that could undermine the course of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and law enforcement agencies must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to learn the truth and punish evil,” Poroshenko said at a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that it was in the best interest of all for Mr Handziuk's murder to be solved and for the killers, perpetrators and clients to “take the necessary responsibility.”
“After this case was reclassified as a murder (case), they are quite rightly and rightly facing a life sentence in prison,” the Ukrainian president said.
He rightly called the public's demand for an open and impartial investigation into the case.
Poroshenko stressed that statements by representatives of law enforcement agencies in parliament should show that “the government is determined to hold criminals and murderers accountable whoever they are.”
He also said political speculation on the subject would not help clarify the situation, but would further confuse things.
“I urge all forces, both government and opposition, not to waste unfounded arguments and, God forbid, not to use this assassination for public relations,” the president said.
'Frankly, we now need to come together to ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast - one that raises public confidence.'
There's just no other way for us. '
“No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation to destabilize the situation in the country,” he said.
Handziuk, who fought against corruption, was attacked and flooded with acid in Cherson in July.
She was an adviser to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack but died in hospital on Sunday.
After police and prosecutors failed to identify the perpetrators of the attack, Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lucenko delivered a resignation statement on Tuesday.
After her death, government officials received accusations from public activists that they were unable to properly conduct an investigation.
Activists also demanded the resignation of the attorney general and interior minister.
“I am submitting my resignation today,” Lucenka told MPs as he read his investigative report.
Parliament has yet to accept the prosecutor's resignation.
Lucenka blamed activists for putting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of Handziuk's murder.
Bill Gates introduced water-free toilet
Introducing a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional such facilities to no water supply to the computer revolution of the 1970 s.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates has introduced a high-tech toilet at an exhibition in Beijing that does not require water in plumbing pipes, Reuters reported.
The water-free toilet works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of waste water are recycled into chemical fertilisers.
“The technologies you see here are the greatest advances in sanitation in the last 200 years,” Bill Gates was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.
The tech toilet was created with the help of a charity foundation set up by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Over seven years, work has been done on a facility that could convert human waste into fertilizer or water, which the foundation has spent $200 million on.
In total, about 20 toilet models were created, according to Bill Gates.
The device is now finished and can be sold.
But in order for such toilets to be produced en masse, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500 thousand children under the age of five die each year due to poor sanitation conditions worldwide.
Tackling problems caused by poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, increases spending on health care, which already stands at 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitation situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates put a jar of faeces in the toilet presentation.
He said it was a good reminder that the small sample “could contain 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria that cause infectious diseases, 100 thousand worm parasitic eggs.”
Slyva was elected president of the Mass Football Association
On 5 November, an extraordinary meeting of the Lithuanian Mass Football Association was held in Kaunas, where Sergei Slyva was elected the new president of the organization.
An extraordinary general meeting of association members was convened as a result of Anatoly Stecenko's request to resign as president of the association.
It was attended by 13 of the 15 members.
The main item on the agenda was the election of the new president.
Two candidates - Sergei Slyva and Vaidotas Rastenis - took part in the election.
11 members of the association voted for Slyva, and two members cast their vote for Rasteni.
Plum will complete Stecenko's term of office, which runs until January 2021.
Anxiety in France: Human deaths are a concern
French health officials announced on Monday that they had permanently banned the widely used pesticide amid concerns about several dozen recent poisonings in the west of the country.
The health agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all pesticide-containing products was made after a new security inspection launched earlier this year, even before at least three waves of poisoning began in September at the Department of Art and Loire.
As a result of these cases, the government had already suspended the use of the pesticide.
This soil disinfectant chemical should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, around 700 tonnes were used each year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, have complained of eye and throat swelling and breathing problems in the Ange region, where many salad juice is grown.
“These episodes confirm the veracity of our decision, but have not hurried it,” Francoise Weber, deputy director of ANSES, told Ouest France on Monday.
Meta - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and Europe - is considered a “likely human carcinogen” by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA).
This pesticide, sold under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is allowed in Europe until 2022, when a new safety check is due.
“There was no choice but to remove him from the market, regardless of whether there were alternatives to him,” Mr Weber told the newspaper.
“We understand the difficulties that salad juice growers, co-farmers, will face, but public health is more important,” she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to halt the use of dropping in a region whose economy relies heavily on intensive agriculture.
More than half of the 35 thousand tonnes of salad juice consumed annually in Europe is grown in the region near Nantes.
Next season there will be “a lot less salad juice, radish and leeks,” Philippe Retiere, head of the Nantes Growers Federation, told AFP last month after the government suspended the use of the throw.
EUR 70 million invested in a shopping centre with a viewing circle in Tallinn
Next weekend, a new T1 shopping centre opens in the Estonian capital, in which the local capital real estate (NT) development company Pro Kapital Grupp has invested EUR 70 million.
The 130,000 sq m total, or 55,000 sq m of rented space, supermarket will have 150 store services or entertainment venues, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, according to the developer's report.
By comparison, the total area of Vilnius “Akropolis” (calculated together with the area for offices) is about 110,000 sq. m., while the rented area is 91,000 sq. m.
T1 is the first supermarket with a viewing wheel on the roof, according to the developer.
It will be operational early next year.
In addition, international transport gates will also be integrated into the area, with a tram nearby and intercity buses about to run.
Rail Baltica's main terminal is also nearby and is forecast to serve 1 million passengers a year around 2026.
Paolo Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says there are fundamental changes in the global supermarket business and the development of T1 has put them at the forefront.
'We've created a new generation of supermarkets that provide emotions and experiences that are not available online.
It's a people's attraction in the heart of the city, a traveller's gates, an impressive and noteworthy attraction and at the same time a quality time with friends or family,” Mr. Michelozzi was quoted as saying in a press release.
Focus on entertainment
According to the supermarket manager, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery centre in the Baltics.
A total of 12,000 sq m, or a fifth of the total rented area, was devoted to entertainment at the facility.
An exclusive highlight is the observation wheel on the roof.
It will raise guests to an altitude of 120 m above sea level - only a TV tower is taller in Tallinn.
Under the review circle, on the fourth floor, there will be a trampoline park Super Skypark, which will open Europe's largest trampoline centre and Estonia's first basketball and volleyball on trampolines, the company says.
The interactive SkyLAB Research and Discovery Centre promises to take children for at least 5-6 hours.
The entertainment complex will also house 360-degree panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the usual cinema shown in six halls, visitors will also be able to get involved in virtual reality cinema with interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to visual effects and moving chairs based on the film's rhythm, the sense of reality here will be enhanced by the perceived effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as the selected smells, smoke or fog in the cinema hall.
According to the developer, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonia's tourism revenue by 13 million euros per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Exchange as well as on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Last year, the group received EUR 1.8 million in sales revenue in Lithuania and suffered losses of EUR 350.000, according to the financial report of Pro Kapital Grupp.
In 2016, the Lithuanian market generated almost EUR 9 million in sales revenue and made a net profit of EUR 2.4 million.
The T1 shopping centre was built by Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
President Paul Biya sworn in for seventh term in Cameroon after controversial election
At a ceremony overseen by parliament speaker Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, Mr. Biya, 85, promised to protect the “integrity and unity” of the West African state.
Africa's oldest president, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was declared the winner in the October 7 election with 71% of the vote.
Still, the election has been clouded by low turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Mr. Biyos's inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the principal, were abducted at a presbyterian school in the Northwest region, where English-speaking separatists are running an armed campaign for independence.
Most of Cameroon's 22 million people are French-speaking and a fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, autonomy was demanded in the Northwest and neighboring Southwest province amid discontent over alleged discrimination in education, judiciary and economics.
In 2017, after Mr. Biya refused to condone, the radicals declared an independent state, the “Republic of Ambazonia,” and raised their weapons.
According to NGOs, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces have been killed in separatist attacks and government retaliatory operations this year.
More than 300 thousand people have fled the violence, some across the border to Nigeria, but many are forced to live in half-starved forests.
In October's election, only 5% of the electorate voted in the Northwest region and 15% in the Southwest province.
In both parts of the country, Mr. Biya received two-thirds of the vote.
Conservative primary election: mistakes were caused by inexperience
“Something was missing - realize that the party had organized everything with its resources.
Some municipalities have allowed their premises to be used, but there have not been polling booths everywhere because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank you to those who lent,” the politician said.
According to him, complaints have been received, but their content does not change substantially and the violations themselves are not malicious.
“There were complaints.
Not all the people who took part in the election were experienced - it was news to them, too.
So from that inexperience, not all actions matched our order.
It was therefore necessary to warn the CEC to comply with the principles we described.
Those complaints, however, do not give rise to doubts about the results,” Anušauskas said.
According to the President of the CEC, there have been cases where ballot papers have not been stamped - after learning about this, ballot papers found in ballot boxes without a stamp have been cancelled.
There was a lack of space in some towns, but according to Anušauskas, complaints and violations related to several dozen ballots.
“Well, because the difference is several thousand, it really doesn't make a fundamental difference to the election results,” Anušauskas explained.
The turnout of party members in the election is said to have been 55%, while the turnout of non-party voters was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked on commissions.
The results announced on Sunday also remain unchanged - 79% of voters (16418 votes) voted for winning Ingrid Shimonytė, while 21% (4441 votes) voted for Vygaudas Ušackas.
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will officially support the nomination of Ms Šimonytė in the country's presidential elections in May next year.
Trump says he probably won't meet Putin in Paris
White House national security adviser John Bolton previously said Mr Trump would meet Mr Putin in Paris, where events will be held this week to mark the 100 th anniversary of the end of World War I.
But on his way to the last rallies before the U.S. Congressional midterm elections, Trump told reporters he wasn't sure if it would be the right opportunity to meet with the Russian president.
“I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not,” the US president said.
Still, the White House chief added, they would see each other at the G-20 summit and “probably meet many times” after that.
Trump is still trying to “reboot” relations with Moscow, despite allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 US presidential election.
Kęstutis Strupas requests annulment of the decision of the COEC
Kęstutis Strupas, former Director General of Santara Clinics at Vilnius University, asks for the annulment of the decision of the Chief Official Ethics Commission (VTEC), which recognised that transactions were not declared in time and thus violated the law.
Mr Strup's complaint was heard by Vilnius District Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be announced on November 26.
The petitioner is requesting the annulment of the decision of 23 May of the COEC, said the court representative Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduona.
Mr Strup believes that gifts given to relatives should not be declared, and says he understood the exception to the law in this way.
The COEC announced in May that the then deposed Director General of Santara Clinics K. Strupas and the head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Division of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital Silvija Strupienė violated the provisions of the Law regulating the declaration of private interests.
The investigation found that four transactions were declared in breach of the deadlines: a loan taken from the bank with his spouse in 2010, a purchase of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift given to his daughter in 2017 - an apartment and a loan granted to a natural person with his spouse in 1996 and not recovered.
Ms Strupienė also declared these transactions by omitting deadlines.
Persons who have violated the Law on the Adjustment of Public and Private Interests in the Civil Service may not be encouraged for a year.
The law obliges you to declare not only your own data, but also your spouse's data.
The investigation was carried out by the VTEC on the basis of information from Info TV television.
It was examined whether K. Strupas and his spouse, head of the Department of Ambulatory Rehabilitation at the Republican Vilnius University Hospital S. Strupienė, had properly and timely declared their transactions.
According to Info TV, last year, Strup gave his daughter a real estate worth 125 thousand euros.
However, the former head of Santara Clinics and his wife had not indicated the data in their declarations of interest.
Law enforcement has made allegations against Mr. Strup, along with at least a dozen others, in a corruption investigation - according to law enforcement, for winning public purchases of computers, software in clinics demanded illegal financial rewards from companies and disguised as support.
In this way, Strup is suspected of having consulted at least five times during public procurement in the field of information technology at Santara clinics.
Mr Strup himself denies his guilt.
Professor Strup, who is suspected of corruption, was fired as head of clinics in Santara in September.
By decision of Santara Clinical Participants Ministry of Health and Vilnius University, employment relations with K. Strupas were terminated at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since November 10, 2013.
Santara clinics continue to be temporarily run by Professor Juozas Raistenskis until a contest to elect a new CEO takes place, and it is expected to be announced later this year.
Congratulations from the President on the anniversary
According to the President, L. Gutauskas brings together religious, historical and philosophical metaphors, eternal values, and opens up the nation's millennial wisdom and memory.
The author's favourite and appreciated work - poetry, prose, children's literature, painting, book illustrations - testifies to Gutauskas being a multi-talented artist.
Welcoming the honorable anniversary, the President thanked the artist for his significant works that enriched Lithuania and wished him inspiration, happiness and success.
Schools already want to teach differently: they promise fewer tests, more practice
Such changes in the content of education are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them on Monday at the Forum “Changing the content of education: foreign experience for solutions in Lithuania” in Vilnius.
Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė, who spoke at the discussion, said over 30 million euros had been invested in updating education content over the past ten years, but no results were seen.
“According to the results of the International Student Achievement Survey PISA, pupils' achievements are below the OECD average,” said Education and Science Minister Jurgita Petrauskienė.
Phil Lambert, an OECD expert quoted in a report by the Ministry of Education and Science, said Lithuania was too focused on providing knowledge rather than practical application of knowledge.
According to him, Lithuania's general education curricula focus on pupils' literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but it is also needed to develop children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy and empathy.
Deputy Minister of Education and Science Gražvydas Kazakevičius, presenting changes in the content of general education, said that the scope of programmes starting to be updated this school year will decrease, they will be more specific and the disciplines will be more closely linked to each other.
According to the Deputy Minister, pupils' education will be more individualised, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare from 10% to 30% of their unique educational content, the current system of assessment of pupils will change to a cumulative score, and learners' competences acquired informally will gain more weight.
Standardised tests will decrease.
General curricula are promised to be digital, user-friendly, linked to e-resources, and a task bank.
Updating the content of education aims to improve pupils' achievements in the international PISA study by at least 10%, reduce the gap between pupils' achievements by a third, give pupils modern competences at school and be literate in various fields.
Lithuania plans to allocate EUR 7.8 million of European Union and state budget funds to update the content of education from May 2018.
The draft general curriculum, updated in the 2019-2020 school year, is expected to be tested in some schools and will be rolled out in all schools from September 2021.
The ministry was criticised in early October for a nearly €8 million project by the Centre for the Development of Education to update general curricula for primary, basic and secondary education.
€7.8 million has been earmarked for four years, and the first €1.3 million purchase was announced in early October to look for curriculum promoters.
After the experts criticized this purchase, it was suspended, the Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskienė dismissed Giedrius Vaidelis, director of the Centre for Development of Education.
Lithuania - Exercise on how to respond to extreme flooding
A ten-day exercise to improve institutions' response to extreme flooding begins in Lithuania on Monday.
As reported by the Fire and Rescue Department (PRD), the exercise will examine how state institutions are prepared to work in the country in the event of a state-level emergency, such as flooding: to deal with its effects, coordinate the search, rescue and immediate eviction of people from besieged areas, organise their supply of drinking water, food, ensure the necessary energy supply and take care of other measures to protect the population.
More than 100 representatives from all the country's ministries, other institutions, as well as members of 12 municipal emergency operations centres will participate in the exercise.
A preparatory phase of the exercise will take place on November 5-13, during which municipalities will take decisions on emergency management after receiving information from the Hydrometeorological Service from the PRD on continued rainfall and onset of flooding.
The active phase of the exercise is scheduled for November 14-15.
During this period, the Department will have the State Emergency Operations Centre, while state and municipal institutions will have the institutions' Emergency Operations Centres.
When the government declares a state-level emergency due to the effects of flooding, the head of operations appointed by the prime minister will lead emergency response, mitigation of its consequences, protection and rescue of residents and property.
PRD Deputy Director Mindaugas Kanapickas says that the most important thing in the exercise is to check the institutions' readiness to perform the functions provided for in legal acts, assess possibilities to exchange information, check how the imminent disaster is prepared to alert and inform residents, state and municipal institutions, agencies and enterprises and “improve the emergency management skills of state institutions.”
The exercise will also showcase the joint capabilities of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters to pump a huge amount of water from besieged areas.
For this purpose, the BaltFloodCombat module was established in 2009.
Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lucenko resigns
Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lucenko, speaking in the country's parliament on Tuesday, announced his resignation over the resonance caused by the death of acid-plagued anti-corruption activist Katherine Gandziuk, according to Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
Under Ukrainian law, a resignation request must be submitted by the attorney general to the country's president, who must submit to the Supreme Rada for approval by a majority.
On Tuesday, Attorney General Lucenko presented the progress and results of a law enforcement investigation into Gandziuk's murder order in Supreme Rada.
In a speech to MPs, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed outrage that Gandziuk's death was being exploited for political public relations.
Ms Gandziuk was a Ukrainian activist, an anti-corruption activist who spoke publicly about police corruption in her hometown of Cherson in southern Ukraine.
On July 31, Mr Gandziuk, an unknown attacker, splashed acid in his face outside her home.
She died in hospital on 4 November as a result of her injuries.
Protesters outside Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs an answer on who killed Mr Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix.
According to Lucenko, the law enforcement investigation includes 12 people potentially involved in ordering Gandziuk's murder.
However, one of the most likely versions of the investigation was leaked to the media, which threatens the success of the investigation.
According to the attorney general, as a result of the leak of information, the suspects received essential information for them.
Mr Lucenko added that he had personally known Mr Gandziuk and was outraged that some politicians were exploiting her blood for public relations.
'For no one to have reason to say that someone is holding on to power, I want to state that I am making a statement to resign.
I will present it today to the President of Ukraine and you will have to discuss this issue in parliament,” Lucenko's speech in Rada is quoted by Obozrevatel.
Lucenko is said to have added that he “cannot allow bipartisanship in the country when the law enforcement system is destroyed without any evidence, even for the crimes revealed.”
Lucenko is seen as a close associate of the country's president, Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed attorney general on 12 May 2016 after protracted attempts to remove his predecessor, Victor Shokin, suspected of covering up corruption among top officials and politicians.
Energy Minister Vaičiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As Aurelija Vernickaitė, an adviser to the Minister of Energy, informed Elta, the meeting will focus on achieving the goals of renewable energy sources in the transport sector by 2020 and after 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport - the only sector currently below the aggregated trajectories set out in the National Renewable Energy Action Plans at EU level - accounted for 6% of renewable energy in 2015.
The EC estimates that progress towards the binding 10% target in the transport sector is relatively slow due to a number of difficulties, including relatively high costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector comes mainly from biofuels (88%) and electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.
The Seimas has taken a proposal to supplement corruption investigation issues with a conservative appeal to the CT
On Tuesday, the Seimas approved such a proposal, registered by Agnė Širinskienė, the “peasant” leading the investigation into illegal influence on political processes.
There were 58 MPs in favour, 27 against and nine abstentions.
The draft will be discussed further by the Committees of the Seimas and the Legal Affairs Committee headed by A. Širinskienė will be appointed as the main committee.
Upon receipt of his conclusion, a vote will be taken on the adoption of the amendment to the resolution.
The Seimas Provisional Investigation Commission, which is currently conducting a new investigation into political corruption, has been instructed to investigate possible illegal influence between 2008 and 2016.
A. Širinskienė proposed to extend this deadline by stating that “significant information about possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and state institutions has appeared in the public sphere”.
A. Širinskienė identifies in the draft “possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or when applying to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of important independent institutions such as the Chief Official Ethics Commission”.
The appeal to the Constitutional Court for pensions was initiated by opposition conservatives.
The ruling “peasants” found that the Conservatives relied largely on the arguments of private pension fund lawyers in their appeal.
The impact on the Chief Official Ethics Commission (VTEC) is blamed by “peasant” leaders on former comrade Paul Urbšys.
According to them, the former Chairman of the Seimas Committee on State Administration and Municipalities could instruct the members of the COEC to dismiss the former head of the Prevention Division of the Commission Mindaugas North.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission to investigate possible illegal influence of interested persons or groups thereof, influence on the course of elections, formation of coalitions, work of parliamentary groups, individual politicians, activities and financing of parties and public movements, legislative processes, election and appointment of members of state-owned enterprises, heads of public institutions, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to look at what information law enforcement and intelligence authorities have provided to competent authorities and how they have responded to it.
The researchers are expected to submit their findings by May 1 next year.
At that time, there will be an election campaign for the president, for the European Parliament.
Of the 12 commissioners, seven are “peasants.”
Two social workers were also appointed as members, one “handler,” a liberal and a representative of the Lithuanian Poles Election Action-Christian Families Union.
The Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to take part in the commission's work.
The new investigation was initiated by Ramūnas Karbauskis, Chairman of the Union of Governors Lithuanian Peasants and Greens.
He said an investigation by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSC) last session, largely on the same subjects, showed that the investigation needed to continue.
Germany's head of internal intelligence has lost his post
Mr Maassen, 55, further fuelled the controversy by claiming that “radical left forces” in Mrs Merkel's coalition were to blame for his troubles.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as previously promised, but forced to retire.
Among other things, it emerged last weekend that at a meeting of representatives of European domestic intelligence organisations in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Mr Maassen criticised Mrs Merkel's “naive” immigration policy.
Horst Seehofer, the German interior minister who has long defended the intelligence chief, said at a press conference on Monday that Maassen's recent comments were unacceptable and had “disappointed him personally.”
Mr Seehofer, himself under pressure from both this dispute and his party's poor performance in Bavaria's local government elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to retire Mr Maassen.
A series of shark attacks have intimidated the entire island - a third person has been bitten
A Queensland Ambulance Service report said the victim suffered “serious leg and wrist wounds” in the attack near Sex Island Sid Harbour off the coast of Queensland.
The man was taken by helicopter to hospital.
The Isle of Sexual is the largest of the archipelago objects of the same name, attracting many lovers of diving and sailing from around the world.
Shark attacks in the region have so far been relatively rare.
One woman was attacked in Sid Harbor on September 19 and a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay the following day.
The last time a shark attack took place in this archipelago before the latest series of attacks was in 2010.
The CEC has two new members - Wisconsin and Pukes
A. Puksas was nominated by the Lithuanian Lawyers' Association.
He will replace Dream Šaltauskienė, seconded by the Lawyers' Society, who has left it.
Mr Viskontas, a lawyer, has been nominated to the members of the CEC, taking into account the provision of the “Order and Justice” party.
This party does not have its representative to the Central Committee when Donatas Laurinavičius withdrew from it.
In a secret ballot, Mr Puks' candidacy was supported by 74 MPs, 5 were against and 6 MPs abstained.

Sleek girls destroy stereotypes about wedding dresses
A sleek girl in a white blown bridal dress - mission (no) possible?
Can a white swan heading towards the altar be bigger than S or M and still look attractive?
Plus-size reality show “The Evolution of Size (r)” will prove today that the beauty and elegance of a bride really doesn't depend on a woman's kilograms.
But that's not all - one of the girls in the project will be in tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will appear on the set.
'There are still some who think bigger girls don't get the attention or glimpses of boys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes me as I am, he doesn't require some standard figure from me,” Aurika, the show's attendant, will say before the show in her wedding dress.
The wedding dress is not easy, in every sense, the garment is a complex structure, it has a lot of material, the dress is heavy, it's uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women think a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident.
I can reassure you that a properly chosen dress model really solves this “problem,”" explained one of the show's commissioners, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
Kalinkin decides the fate of the girls in the project along with the entire commission - Erika Vitulskiene, who opened a plus-size fashion house, photographer and social networking star Nagliu Bieranc, and TV producer Laura Bird.
'When deciding which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there's a lot of quarrel between the commissioners - after all, we all represent different spheres and have different views of the winner of the show.
The task of showcasing wedding dresses was compounded by the fact - I can now reveal - that there were two newcomers who certainly weren't worse than the incumbents.
It was a special evening in every sense,” Kalinkin says.
The newcomers - Eve, who became famous for her 23-year-old scandalous behavior on one summer reality show, and Doville, a 31-year-old mother of two children of exceptional beauty - took part in a screening of “The Evolution of Size (r)” like other girls and were in the top twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo shoot of the girls on the streets of Vilnius City, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls were brought back to the show by LNK viewers who voted for their favourites on the television portal.
After receiving international recognition, the sleek beauty reality show is taking place in Lithuania for the second week, where plus-size girls compete for the name of the country's first plus-size star.
So far, there are only eight of them left - and they are all well aware that there will only be one winner.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of reality show “The Evolution of Size (r)” begins this Monday night at 20.30 am on LNK.
Actor Elba has been selected as the world's sexiest man
Us magazine People has published this year's sexiest man in the world.
He became a 46-year-old British actor named Idris Elba.
Although the man says the news was unexpected, he was not short of amusement when he talked about the new title.
I thought,” Can't be!
Seriously? ”
'Then I looked myself in the mirror and thought - yes, I look sexy today,' the actor shared with a laugh.
To be honest, Idris said this title was a very pleasant feeling that stroked his ego.
The British star says he often received abusive words and bullying, which made his childhood difficult because, as he puts it, he was “very tall and clumsy.”
The young actor also disliked his peers and became the subject of bullying because of his rare and unusual name and his African background.
“As soon as I raised my moustache and muscles, I became the toughest guy in my city district,” Idris smiles.
When a man doesn't have to be proud on Ose screens, Elba works as a jockey at parties held in Spain and especially in bustling Ibiza.
In his spare time, the man enjoys Thai boxing and has a vein for fashion, which he realises by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor insists that family is the most important thing for him in the world, so he plans a wedding with fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
Ms Elba became the 33 rd person elected by People magazine to be the world's sexiest man.
Blake Shelton had the title in 2017.
Man beaten to death during drinking in Shirvintai district
On Monday evening, a man was beaten to death during a drink in the village of Šalkiškės in the Shirvintai district.
According to Vilnius County Police, a report was received at 21.16 am that a man had beaten a neighbour during a drink.
When paramedics arrived, they found the death of a man born in 1943.
The suspect, who was born in 1994 and was found to be 2.53 pm drunk, was arrested.
Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident.
Managers no longer require a distance of 20 km in the construction of waste incineration plants
Vilnius Cogeneration Power Plant, near Gariūnai Market, is under construction.
The rulers no longer want the construction of waste incineration plants to maintain a distance of 20 kilometres from settlements.
The head of the Environmental Protection Committee, “peasant” Kęstutis Mažeika, registered an amendment to the Waste Management Law in the Seimas on Monday refusing such a requirement.
According to Mr. Mažeika, the “peasant” group, which has previously supported the provision for a distance of 20 km, promises to support the amendment on its refusal.
Mr. Mažeika's amendment provides that from January 2019, waste incineration plants could be built under statutory environmental and public health requirements.
He admits the amendments were prompted by the president's doubts about such a ban.
“Given the definition of the residential area, it is clear that a place where the above-mentioned objects could be built would be almost impossible to discover,” the committee chairman says.
The ruling majority in October opposed the president's veto amendments tightening the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of incineration plants closer than 20 km from settlements, the amendments provided for permission for the government to make decisions on the future of the two power plants already under construction, taking into account public health interests.
The latter provision is not proposed by Mr Mažeika.
In Vilnius, the waste and biofuel-fired power plant is being built by the energy group Lietuvos energija and in Kaunas – together with Fortum Heat Lietuva, a Finnish energy group.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipeda.
It's about a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
The leaders of Britain and Ireland discussed a possible compromise on Monday on the complex Northern Ireland issue stalling Brexit negotiations, Dublin said.
Speaking by phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered an opportunity to review the so-called hedging arrangement mechanism, which would allow an open border between the UK province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the European Union.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar promised to consider the proposal, but ruled out any possibility of Britain unilaterally withdrawing from the deal, according to a report released by the Irish government.
In the interview, Mrs May “raised the possibility of reviewing the hedging mechanism,” it said.
“Varadkar has made it clear that he is open to reviewing new proposals, provided that the outcome of such a review is not related to a unilateral decision to end the use of hedging measures,” the government report said.
Brexit negotiators cannot find an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the land border between the UK and Ireland when Britain leaves the single market and customs union in March next year.
Both sides agree on “hedging measures” to keep the border between the Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to apply temporarily to the UK as a whole.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab wants Britain to be able to withdraw from the hedging agreement unilaterally after three months.
But Mr Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government “cannot support it.”
“The three-month or limited-term hedging measures are not worth the paper on which they will be written,” he said.
In the past, London and Brussels have not confirmed information on a breakthrough in Brexit talks following a report in Britain over the weekend that an agreement is hand-in-hand.
“I would say we are continuing to make progress in the negotiations but there is still work to do,” Mrs May's London spokesman said.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas also told reporters: “We're not there yet.”
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, issued a declaration on Monday calling for the right to reliable information in the internet era.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, as well as Nobel Prize-winning writer Mario Vargas Llosa.
“We call on goodwill leaders across all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debate through which citizens can make decisions based on facts,” the group's report said.
They argue that a “global space of information and communication” is a common good that “must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and views.”
“People have a fundamental right to information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated on the basis of commitment to truth, principles of pluralism of views and rational methods of fact-finding,” the authors of the declaration added.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who often criticizes “fake news” but is regularly accused of distorting facts.
World leaders should take a stand on the issue when they meet for the “Peace Forum” in Paris on 11-13 November, signatories have urged.
This declaration was made within two months under the leadership of Mr Ebadi and Christopher Deloire, head of the Paris-based media freedom and journalists' rights organisation Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
The Seimas approved higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Law on Product Safety stipulating that penalties for violations of product safety must be increased.
The amendments were unanimously approved in the Chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health Affairs, said in relation to the new project, it is to be welcomed that the objectives set are related to better protection of consumers of products.
Furthermore, its provisions are adapted to the requirements of the decision of the European Parliament and the Council.
“In my opinion, the proposed bill distributes better and more specifically to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: producers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As the practice shows, the current penalty system does not always prevent further violations, as entities continue to commit repeated violations after paying fines,” Vinkus said.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy and supplemented by its proposals after the approval of the Government by the Seimas Economic Committee.
The amendments to the Law aim at increasing penalties for infringements, strengthening consumer protection, empowering market surveillance authorities and establishing a clear framework for monitoring product safety requirements and compliance.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for manufacturers to properly label the product to ensure its traceability.
Moreover, according to the Ministry, market surveillance authorities have not been granted the right to enter the territory of producers and suppliers, buildings, premises and carry out inspections, which complicates the work of the authorities.
According to the Ministry, the six-month deadline for imposing fines and warnings is too short to detect an infringement, conduct an investigation and impose a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the fines imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - 14 companies did so in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Economy proposed imposing an obligation on manufacturers to properly label the product, thereby ensuring its traceability, in order to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to identify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to enter the territory, buildings, premises and inspections of economic entities which produce, place products on the market in the course of state control of product safety.
The intention is to increase the amount of fines for violations of the law.
A producer, importer or authorised representative who has placed dangerous products on the market and a distributor who has placed them on the market would be fined between EUR 150 and EUR 2 500 (now between 144 and 1 448) for providing dangerous services or providing services.
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (VVTAT) or another market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing and placing on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, a fine of between EUR 1 000 and EUR 5 000 (now between 868 and 4 344) would be imposed.
Failure to comply with the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of between €2,500 and €6,500 (now between €1,448 and €5,792).
If dangerous products have caused harm to the health of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 2 500 and EUR 15 000 (now between 1 448 and 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the consumer's death, a fine of between €6,500 and €25,000 (now between 5,792 and 23,169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, a fine of up to 25 thousand euros (the minimum amount of the fine has not been set) is imposed for violation of product safety legislation, in Belgium – from 26 euros to 600 thousand euros, in Romania – from 155 euros to 6 666 euros, in Bulgaria – from 125 euros to 7 500 euros.
10-year-old had a baby: she was raped by a family member
The event in Colombia has shocked millions of people.
A 10-year-old girl raped by her older brother has given birth to a healthy boy.
The baby saw the world thanks to a caesarean section, but both the girl and her baby feel good.
They were under medical supervision for a while.
It has yet to take some time for the young mother and child to be released home.
“Based on the information I received from police officers, the little girl became pregnant after she was sexually abused by a family member - her brother,” the director of the hospital where the birth was accepted told a foreign television.
Police are investigating the incident for rape and child abuse.
Norway's armed battalion took part in NATO exercises in the most remote and harsh areas
Soldiers from the Norwegian armed forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the country's capital Oslo.
It is part of NATO's Trilateral Connector 2018 exercise - NATO's largest exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most soldiers from Norway's second military battalion spent a lot of time away from home, in places like Afghanistan - that is, in warm lands - after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
But most of all, they are skilled in fighting in the Arctic, and these skills are particularly helpful now that NATO is shifting its focus.
In recent days, troops have taken part in inscribed battles against real British soldiers in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the most remote and harsh areas.
Soldiers have the skills to survive this cold in the wild, but in the harsh climate they have to drag much more weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers staying at the headquarters say they share their skills on how to survive and fight in such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, which, like no other, are particularly reminiscent of actual warfare, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.

Retired Kaunas Vice Mayor does not plan to return to politics
Former Kaunas Vice Mayor Povilas Mačiulis, who left his job in the municipality and the United Kaunas organization due to his support for Vygaudas Ušackas in the presidential election, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
“I'm going to focus on business.
I am a shareholder in several companies and I also have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to devote more time to my family,” Mr. Mačiulis said.
He said he also did not plan to take part in the next municipal elections.
Mr. Mačiulis had not yet had a chance to speak to V. Ušackas after he lost the primary election of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union to Ingrida Šimonytė on Sunday.
'To be honest, we haven't had time to discuss the results in detail with him and the team and talk about future plans.
Obviously, when Vygaudas withdraws from the next election fight, this stage of my life is over,” Mr. Mačiulis said.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas politics because of his support for Ushack, but regretted that “Lithuania has lost a unique opportunity to have a real leader in the context of international relations.”
Mr. Mačiulis briefly served as deputy mayor of Kaunas in 2011 and later returned to office after the successful election of “United Kaunas” in 2015.
He is a shareholder in Erudito Lyceum, a private school, and several other companies.
There are workers at Kaunas Castle: what are they doing here?
When the Koreans noticed the workers working at Kaunas Castle, they hoped that work was finally underway to rebuild the surviving tower.
Gabriel Sužiedėlis, director of Kaunas City Museum, kauno.diena.lt the portal, said that work is underway to change the coating of the protective roofs of the southwestern tower with a fragment of the defensive wall.
According to the interviewer, the roofs will be cans.
'The worn tin coating in an emergency condition was a threat to others - people could fall in and injure themselves - so it had to be replaced.
The roofs were no longer moisture-resistant, so it also damaged heritage,” the museum's director explained.
Will these roofs be similar to what they were a few centuries ago?
“All works are coordinated with heritage and other institutions,” he added, seeking to make the result as authentic as possible, but at the same time the practical side is important - roofs must protect values from moisture.
A versatile solution has been chosen to work with the heritage.
Before that, the elements of Kaunas Castle were covered with tin back in the Soviet era, so they no longer had historical value,” the director of Kaunas City Museum elaborated.
The works contract was signed on October 2.
It is planned that the work will not last more than three months from the signing of the contract.
“It is expected to be completed by the end of November,” the museum's director said.
According to him, the value of the work carried out is almost 24 thousand euros.
This amount was budgeted for this year, according to the interviewer.
The works in Kaunas Castle are carried out by the company Statija.
Kaunas. diena.lt has written how, according to the research carried out, Kaunas Castle may have looked earlier.
Us and South Korea resume naval exercises
A naval exercise with about 500 troops will now take place in the southern city of Pohang for two weeks, the Defense Ministry said in Seoul.
The US has deployed 28,500 soldiers in South Korea.
The two countries have been preparing joint military maneuvers for years, which Pyongyang calls a “provocation” and “preparation for invasion.”
On Friday, North Korea threatened to resume its nuclear program unless Washington lifts economic sanctions against Pyongyang.
Such a change in course could be “seriously considered,” North Korea's foreign ministry said.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a television interview that punitive measures would remain until Pyongyang gave up its nuclear weapons.
At the same time, he announced that he would meet North Korean envoy Kim Yong Chol in New York this week.

Eastern European Studies Centre will collaborate with two prominent US “brain centers”
According to Linas Kojala, head of the EESC, who is based in Vilnius and has been counting for thirteenth year of operation, networking in the USA will allow projects to be implemented and will make Lithuania's voice more audible on the other side of the Atlantic.
“We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that two large institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that niche activities will emerge because the topics we analyze for NATO, security, misinformation, and development of Eastern Partnership states are also priorities for them,” Kojala said.
The agreements note that the EESC and the US institutions will work together to prepare applications for international projects, exchange expertise and expertise, and organise expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have a great international reputation.
The fpri has been operating since 1955 and brings together nearly a hundred top-level analysts.
In the latest global ranking of analytical centers compiled by the University of Pennsylvania, the fpri ranked seventh in its category.
At the time, CEPA, whose analysts have repeatedly been invited to advise and work for top U.S. political institutions, is in the top ten in the same ranking.
“This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to break into the US information space and encourage us to raise the quality cartel up,” Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be to help partners disseminate the forthcoming EESC analytical publication Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review among US decision makers and in the public sphere.
The Eastern European Studies Centre operates on the basis of ongoing projects and is not supported by targeted grants.
The EESC partners with whom joint initiatives are implemented include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
Two buildings collapsed in Marseille
Two people were lightly injured when two buildings collapsed in the city of Marseille in the south of France on Monday, the fire service said.
Debris poured into the street as buildings collapsed and clouds of dust rose.
Dozens of firefighters worked at the scene near Marseille's famous Old Port, some with trained dogs.
The local prefecture posted photos on Twitter showing a pile of debris and wooden beams, a huge gap in where buildings stood, firefighters working at the scene and cars covered in a thick layer of dust.
Officials said they were looking for people who may have been under the rubble.
Marseille firefighters tweeted that two people were being treated for minor injuries.
The amateur video, shown by bfm-tv, shows clouds of dust in the street and passers-by covering their mouths with sleeves.
Google Street View photos taken before the incident show one of the collapsed buildings was five and the other six floors.
One of these buildings was clearly in poor condition, with closed windows, with large facade cracks.
The mayor of the Marseille district in question, Sabine Bernasconi, said one of these buildings was in poor condition and had been ordered to be evacuated.
But the mayor could not rule out the possibility that the building may have been used by people who had been living there arbitrarily.

Restaurant in Mexico helps migrants deported from the US
The farther away, the more Mexicans are deported back, and they struggle to adapt when they return.
“When I was deported, they took everything away: the house, the car, the clothes.
They took away everything but one thing - my knowledge,” says Victor Hugo Hernandez, the restaurant's director.
The restaurant's board hopes that combining Mexican and U.S. cultures will promote better understanding among themselves.
Afghan Special Forces member shot American instructor during training
Brent Taylor, the 39-year-old mayor of Nort Ogden, north of Salt Lake City, had taken a year-long vacation to carry out a mission in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer at the Joint Forces Staff but was due to return to work as mayor in January.
Another member of the US military, whose name has not yet been made public, was wounded in the attack on Saturday that killed Mr Taylor.
According to officials, Taylor died of infantry gun fire.
Maj. Gen. Jefferson S. Burton, commander of the Utah National Guard, told reporters that Taylor had helped train and strengthen the capabilities of the Afghan National Army.
Utah media cited a NATO report that Taylor had been shot by one of the trained special forces soldiers and that the attacker had been killed by Afghan forces.
Mr Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His remains are expected to be flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Monday afternoon.
He had previously carried out two missions in Iraq, and this mission in Afghanistan was also his second.
In January, before leaving for Afghanistan, Taylor told local media that he had been assigned to a team of advisers and instructors from one of that country's special forces battalion.
At that time, hundreds of residents of Nort Ogden gathered on the streets of a city of about 17 thousand residents to escort their mayor, who was travelling with his family on a police-escorted card.
Taylor became mayor of the city in 2013.
