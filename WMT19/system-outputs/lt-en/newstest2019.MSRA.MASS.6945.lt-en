MG Baltic case: the new Gustainis lawyer says he has not yet been able to get acquainted with the material of the case
All the accused gathered to the eleventh hearing of the MG Baltic case on Monday: Šarūnas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The hearing began with testimony from the defendants.
At the last court hearing, Alexander Doroshev, the state-appointed new lawyer of Š. Gustainis, told the panel of judges that he had not yet been able to get acquainted with the material of the case.
Linas Belevičius, the lawyer of MG Baltic, then stated that in order to ensure the full defence of the person, the panel of judges must allow the new lawyer to get acquainted with the material of the case and asked for the hearing to be postponed.
'To ensure a person's defence, he or she must have access to the criminal case material.
This is not just a formal sitting, "- stated L. Belevičius.
The new lawyer, Mr Doroshev, noted that he had not been able to access either the indictment or all the material in the case.
At the previous court hearing, suspect Gustainis announced that he had refused his lawyer because he would no longer be able to pay him.
Audio recordings were also heard at the hearing.
Lawyers for the accused were angry that the audio recordings submitted to the court were of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that politicians, taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated decisions in favour of the concern in the Seimas and other state institutions, as well as had an impact in determining the winners of public procurement, recalls ELTA.
More than 150 persons were questioned during the pre-trial investigation, more than 50 of whom were members of the Seimas of the last and this term of office, several former ministers and members of the European Parliament.
There have been more than 200 surveys and more than 30 searches.
It is suspected that Gustainis received a bribe of more than 8 thousand euros, G. Steponavičius - 15 thousand euros, V. Gapšys - more than 27 thousand E. Masiulis is suspected of taking a bribe of more than 106 thousand euros.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trade impact, the Liberal Movement is suspected of bribery, trade impact and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of bribery and trade impact of these parties.
It is suspected that politicians discussed bribes with R. Kurlianskis, vice-president of the MG Baltic Group, and later proposed or supported initiatives favourable to the concern in the Seimas or other institutions.
Ethical guardians: The Board of the Liberal Movement on the act of the Vilnius Division is right
"The decisions taken by the Board comply with the statutes" - after the meeting of the commission BNS reported its leader Vytautas Tamošiūnas.
'For us, that decision wasn't something new.
We had already made an interpretation as a commission in July, when there was a question about Pagėgiai and Utena.
Then we said that according to the statutes, this is a matter of competence for the board.
And if the board decides that some department can behave as it wants - go with the committee and the board supports this, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has adopted, then there is a decision that all departments form party lists.
And if you do not agree with the board, then there is a possibility to suspend membership and go with the committee ', he added.
According to V. Tamošiūnas, the party board will now decide on further actions.
On 17 October, the Board of the Liberal Movement of the Party cancelled the decision of the Vilnius City Division to participate in municipal elections not with the list of the party, but with the list of a new sailing electoral committee.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the liberals of the capital to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party statutes and the decisions of the board.
By 31 October, the Vilnius Department had to cancel its ambitions to participate in municipal elections with the list of the committee.
But the department didn't do that.
The former head of the department, parliamentarian Aušrinė Armonaitė, has already withdrawn from the Liberal Movement.
The Mayor of Vilnius, former chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus Šimašius, promising to seek another term of office of the head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius, which we are proud of!."
He also left the party.
Elections to municipal councils and mayors will take place in March next year.
Residents of a village in northern India drove a tiger with a tractor, which previously torn one man, reported by officials on Monday.
Mahavir Kaujlagi (Mahavir Kaudžlagis), a forest maintenance officer, said that after tearing a man who worked in the fields late on Sunday, the villagers surrounded the beast and, when the woman tried to escape, drove it with a tractor.
Residents say that this tiger also attacked and torn one young man about 10 days ago.
Mimas village is located in the Dudhva tiger reserve in Lakhympur Kher district, about 250 km southeast of Laknau, the capital of the state of Uttar Pradesh.
Galabing of tigers in protected areas is prohibited.
Ramesh Pandey, Director of the Cluster, said that under the Wildlife Protection Act, the case in question would be reported to the police.
In April, villagers beat another tiger in the Nighasan district of the state of Uttar Pradesh, which suffered serious injuries.
Tiger is an Indian national animal; under the Wildlife Conservation Act, tigers are considered an endangered species.
Last year's government figures show that for the previous three years, at least one person was killed every day in collisions with wild tigers or elephants.
Human conflicts with tigers have been gradually increasing since the 1970s, when India launched a tiger protection programme, which established reserves in national parks and the power of big cats was criminalised.
Although the methods of calculating tigers have changed, the censuses would show that the then population of around 1 800 tigers increased to 2 226 individuals in 2014.
It is proposed that cats and dogs must be marked with microchips
Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on the Environment, together with other members of the Seimas, registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, which propose that cats and dogs must be marked with subcutaneous chips.
"We propose that cats and dogs must be marked with subcutaneous chips and that their registration and labelling be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be labelled free of charge with public funds, and cats in 2020, so the population will not have concerns and the costs will be covered by specially planned state funding, "said Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on the Environment.
The amendments to the law aim to address the systemic need for the labelling of domestic animals.
It is expected that this will help to avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal farmers, illegal multipliers or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that, according to the expected average cost of providing a microchip and service, which will amount to around EUR 5, all animal owners will be compensated during the transitional period.
The total cost of labelling all pets can be up to EUR 6 million.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be distributed over three years and will amount to EUR 2 million every year.
It is expected that funds will be allocated to labelling programmes through the Municipal Environment Support Specific Programme, the income of which will increase significantly this year due to increased taxes on natural resources and the redistribution of funds.
Municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for the labelling of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programmes.
According to K. Mažeika, the practice of compulsory labelling is common in almost all countries of the European Union, which makes it possible to protect the animals themselves (because lost can easily be returned to owners) and saves the time of animal farmers themselves when a lot of time and funds have to be spent on the search for a refugee and lost pet.
In addition, EU legislation provides that travel is only possible with marked pets.
At the same time, labelling obliges you to take responsible care of the animal throughout its life.
Previous proposals for compulsory labelling were opposed, as the relevant programmes were proposed to be financed by the population.
"The model now being presented should avoid this criticism, because it is proposed to finance animal protection with increased income in the environmental support programme and the right of labelling not only to veterinarians, but also to the public, i.e. persons of animal care institutions who have listened to special courses at the Veterinary Academy," - says the authors of the project.
The draft law was registered by a group of members of the Seimas representing different groups of the Seimas - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 members of government forces were killed in a Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
The spokesman for the provincial governor, Arif Noori, pointed out that seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that four other soldiers were injured in the attack on a joint army and police control post in the Chogyani district.
According to Mr Noori, during the three-hour battle with the Afghan forces, six fighters were killed and ten more Taliban were injured.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement to the media in which the movement takes responsibility for Monday's attack in Ghazni province.
Mr Noori said that this post was installed two days ago in a strategically important area to cut off the Taliban supply route.
The post was completely destroyed in the attack.

On Wednesday, FIBA Europe Cup fourth round matches will take place in Vilnius "Ryto" Arena, where Kosovo and Ukrainian clubs will meet.
Dvikova will be held in the capital for political reasons.
On November 7, Vilnius "Rytas," which maintains warm relations with Ukrainian basketball, will accept Cherkasy "Cherkaski Mavpy" and Pristina "KB Prishtina" teams under its roof in "Ryto" arena.

Lithuania is one of the best basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honour for us to play here.
We hope that we will receive support from the residents of Vilnius.
The Kosovo team was unable to come to Ukraine because these countries do not have any diplomatic relations.

Then 100: 61 victory was celebrated by the Ukrainian team.
Basketball fans will be able to enter the game free of charge on Wednesday and the duel starts at 19: 00.
"Women lie better" star actress B. Arsobaitė is persecuted by liars
This is probably only a coincidence, but the charming brown actress Brigita Arsobaitė has already received roles related to liars several times.
Initially, the series "Women lie better," then the performance "Melages" and finally the comedy "Melagiai."
In this film Brigita plays the square wife of the hero of Dainius Kazlauskas.
"I very much liked to film in" Melagiai, "because I am more a theatre actress and I rarely appear in the cinema.
A wonderful team of colleagues promised an excellent result from the beginning.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
However, the most interesting thing that happened on the pitch was the puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would definitely be big and serious.
I never admired those small, decorative "fife" four legs.
However, during the filming Sunny was so attached to me that sympathy became mutual and finally I even wanted to buy it from the owner, but without success, "- smiles the actress.
From the first minutes a new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai," produced by the producer of Lithuanian film hits "Inexperienced" and "Among Us, Boys..." Paulius Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionov are turning to the comical and intriguing periphery of family members.
Your sweetheart just reported - she's waiting.
It would be great news, only... your sweetheart is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Without being able to publish all "good news," parents suddenly declare - they differ!
After 50 years together...
And all this takes place just before the most beautiful holidays of the year - St. Christmas!
But the end will surprise even more, because no one expected such an atomic.
All heroes are not as they seemed at first glance...
In addition to B. Arsobaitė "s comedy" Melagiai, "four generations of film stars will present a good mood to the audience: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Liubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
Comedy "Melagiai" - in the cinema from November 9
Deciding whether to write off EUR 100 million in taxes not paid by emigrants
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted an amendment to the Law on the Declaration of Residence drafted by Ramūnas Karbauskis, the leader of "peasants."
56 members of the Seimas voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstentions.
The Seimas will continue to take the consideration of the amendments on 6 December or later, following the conclusion of the Government.
According to R. Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarian, one person does not pay about EUR 1 000 in three years, and now there are about 100 000 such persons.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas regretted that in this way the Seimas would 'encourage some people not to comply with their obligations' - to declare their departure and then no taxes would be calculated.
Antanas Matulas, a Conservative member of the Committee on Health, noticed that Lithuanians living abroad use the fact that when paying a small health insurance tax, they come to Lithuania for treatment - they are provided with the same services as residents paying this tax.
The amendments provide that persons who will pay social security contributions in the countries of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation would be considered when they leave Lithuania, and Sodra will exempt them from the payment of health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevičius, the head of "Sodra," said earlier that such a step will facilitate both the life of people who have emigrated and the activities of "Sodra."
Video spread online of a slipping teddy bear reveals a serious problem
It is filmed how the mother bear climbs on a steep snowy slope, and the little one still climbs, slips down and stubbornly climbs again.
The video has received numerous views and comments.
People admired the perseverance of the little bear - when he repeatedly slipped down, he climbed to his mother again.
He does not succeed at the first time, but the little one does not try to give up and finally achieves his goal.
The video really pays attention, but it also reveals the threat posed by humans to animals.
Scientists claim that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people "s desire to know wild nature can sometimes be harmful.
'It's obvious to me that the bears were very frightened by the drone.
You can see from their movements that they panic.
If the drone did not fly around, they would probably have chosen a safer path or overcome it more slowly or more carefully.
This is an excellent example of how drones should not be used, "ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago, Mr Ditmer, together with his colleagues, investigated how drones affect bears.
The animals were equipped with heart work meters.
When the drone approached, some bears allowed to flee, others did not run anywhere, but all their hearts started beating more often from fear.
Scientists advise to use drones to film animals responsibly, not to fly too close, not to make noise and not to fly where it is forbidden.
The runaway president was approached through a newspaper
On Tuesday, the Kiev court invited the deposed President Viktor Yanukovych, who withdrew to Russia, to come to the meeting of the case for the betrayal of his alleged state in an unusual way - the summons was published in the Official Journal of the state.
The court summons, published in the government news newspaper Uriadovoj kurjer, invites the former leader to come to a criminal hearing on 19 November, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that Yanukovych has the right to attend the meeting by video link.
On 30 October, the Kiev court announced the end of the debate in the case of Yanukovych.
Alexander Gorošinski, Yanukovych's lawyer working in Russia, was given the opportunity to register in the register of foreign lawyers by 19 November so that he could attend a meeting where Yanukovych is expected to say his last word by video link.
Yanukovych, supported by the Kremlin, was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the President's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader was taken to Russia during a special operation organised by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula belonging to Ukraine, and a little later there was a war in the east of the country between separatists supported by Kiev and Russia.
Since then, the fighting has claimed the lives of around 10 000 people, despite many attempts by the international community to secure a long-term cease-fire.
Valdas Benkunskas will lead the Conservative list to the Vilnius City Council
The former Minister of Economy, parliamentarian Dainius Kreivys, has already been approved as a Conservative candidate for a year.
During the weekend, during the Conservative primary elections, members of the party rated the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Municipality Council.
As reported by the party, V. Benkunskas, Chairman of the Vilnius Department of the TS-LKD, became the leader of the Conservative list.
The first ten candidates were members of Vilnius City Municipality Council Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adomas Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Baškienė, former Member of the Seimas Liutauras Kazlavickas, Chairman of the Young Conservative League Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karazijaitė.
Direct elections to mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on 3 March next year.
Restrictions on cogeneration plants appealed to the Constitutional Court
The opposition of the Seimas, as it promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (CT) the decision of those in power to adopt a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition group of the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) of the Seimas reported that a group of members of the Seimas appealed to the CT to investigate the compliance of the ruling amendments to the Law on Waste Management with the Constitution.
"Members stress that the provisions of the law aim to question the projects of waste incineration plants currently being carried out, entrusting the government to impose new restrictions (a distance of 20 km from the residential area) until the entry into force of the law for the construction of waste incineration plants started in Vilnius and Kaunas," according to the report.
"Members note that, taking into account how the law formulated a ban on the construction of objects of national significance of waste management (i.e. determines the distance and defines the concept of" residential territory "), it must be concluded that this ban disproportionately restricts or even denies the essence of the very right to carry out economic activities related to the burning of waste for energy production, because the established criteria are formulated in such a way that, after assessing the density and distribution of the Lithuanian population in the country, it would be practically impossible to build such objects throughout the territory of the country," it adds.
The appeal states that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
'The CT has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and consequences that arose before the entry into force of the newly adopted legislation.
In this case, the government is given the power to apply the law back on the basis of an indefinite criterion.
The introduction of such legal regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security, the protection of legitimate expectations, and therefore the constitutional principle of the rule of law ', the appeal states.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in the projects of cogeneration plants in Vilnius and Kaunas.
After the suspension of the current projects, the state would suffer not only hundreds of millions of financial losses, and the Lithuanian population would also suffer huge losses - it would increase heating prices and increase environmental pollution due to the growing amount of waste disposal in landfills.
The appeal to the CT was signed by members from the Seimas TS-LKD, Liberal Movement, Social Democratic Groups and Vice-Chairman of the ruling Social Democratic Labour Group Algirdas Butkevičius.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to collect 71 votes with the votes of those in power to reject the amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaite, which provide for the government's right to suspend the construction of cogeneration plants already started, and established a 'quarantine' zone of 20 km from residential areas for the construction of such power plants.
Amendments to the law re-adopted by the Seimas will enter into force from 1 January 2019. It is true that those in power are already proposing to abandon the restriction of 20 km.
This proposal is planned to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, it is not planned to abandon the government's right to suspend projects already started.
The CT will deal with this case in a row - no earlier than a year later.
Published the question statistics of LeBron James at the Lakers Club
The beginning of LeBron James "career at the Los Angeles Lakers Club is not what he himself, organization and basketball fans expected.
The Lakers started the season with four victories and six losses, and such a weak start helped to create rumours about the possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
However, such speeches were reassured by Magic Johnson, the president of basketball operations, who stated that he would not forgive the coach, but it is necessary to play better.
L. James, the biggest star of the team, should also turn to himself.
Although the attacker "s statistics are usually impressive - 26,8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 assists.
However, it does not tell the whole truth.
During the first ten games of the season, other figures also emerged showing that Lakers play better when there is no James on the square.
The attacker is unfavorable + / - statistics showing how many more points are thrown or spent by the team when there are certain players on the square.
Here, when James is on the field, the Lakers spent 30 points more this season than the rivals.
When he sat on the bench "lakes" earned 19 points more than competitors.
Currently, the Lakers take only 13th place in the Western Conference, but several victories can turn everything to the feet of the high.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania greatly appreciates Spain's cooperation in NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and region," Minister Linkevičius said.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out NATO air police and air police strengthening missions in the Baltic States five times, including three times in Lithuania.
The last time Spanish Eurofighter planes were deployed in Šiauliai between May and August this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations on security, political, economic and strategic communication in the fight against propaganda are taking place between Lithuania and Spain.
L. Linkevičius expressed the hope that Lithuania and Spain would continue to cooperate closely on the European, transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.

On 29 October, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented letters of distinction to President Dalia Grybauskaite.
V. Achenė on the detention of R. Ačas: I believe in man's innocence and law enforcement
'For me, it was the most unexpected thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, the services are probably doing the work that they must do.
We are each doing our job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is right and fair, that no unfair actions should be done, "- BNS said V. Achenė.
R. Ačas was detained by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday - law enforcement suspects that he, while still the director of the Raseiniai municipal administration, took a bribe of high value, and in exchange he could create exceptional conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the Raseiniai Bus Park managed by the municipality.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly bribing Mr Ačas or participating in masquerading bribes in various financial operations.
The Raseiniai District Municipality Council dismissed R. Ačas from the position of head of administration at a third attempt in April this year after the expressed mistrust.
The former "tvarkietis" became a member of the newly established Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminas Kirkilas in March of this year and suspended membership of this party on Monday.
A few years ago, Mr Ačas did not succeed in the mayor elections as a representative of the electoral committee Tavo Raseiniai.
V. Achenė says that the man did not intend to stand as a candidate in the election of the mayor of Raseiniai next year, but had not yet decided whether he would not participate in the elections to the municipal councils.
V. Achenė was elected to the Seimas with the list of the Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union and is a member of the Anti-Corruption Commission of the Seimas.
The politician says she will wait for further law enforcement action, which will depend on whether she removes herself from work in the commission.
"I really do not make sudden decisions today, this week I think I will decide.
I will see if there is a need for what charges have been brought, I will, of course, make one decision or another.
It is probably necessary for me to stay away from all the things that are being investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again, everything is a complex time in my places', she said.
The representative of the opposition conservatives at the Seimas Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė urged the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Pranckietis and the head of "peasants" Ramūnas Karbauskas to dissociate himself from the statements of the group colleague Vida Achenė and to withdraw it from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission, transferring it to another Seimas committee or commission.
It states that the further work of V. Achene in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission "would cause mistrust in society and discredit the work of an important parliamentary supervision commission."
Sensitive Coldplay music also attracted famous Lithuanian couples
On the autumn Monday evening, many music and film lovers gathered for the preliminary premiere of the film Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams.

Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met at the 1996 College and founded Pectoralz.
Soon they were joined by bassist Guy Berryman and a little later drummer Will Champion.
The group changed its name to Coldplay and exactly twenty years ago released its first record Safety, which included three works.
Of the 500 copies of the record, most were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, and just 50 copies of Safety went on sale.
Now Coldplay is a globally familiar, respected and loved group that has released seven albums that have sold more than 100 million copies.
Over two decades, the group has won 107 various awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.

Grybauskaite calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaite invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for investment by European Union (EU) countries and to facilitate foreign import conditions.
At the opening of the trade and investment forum at the Chinese import exhibition in Shanghai, Mrs Grybauskaite stressed that, seeing signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to 'unite efforts to halt the spread of protectionism in the world,' targeting the root causes of the tension caused by trade wars, 'excess production and unfair competition'.
"What is vitally important for the European Union is China's commitment to create a more attractive, open environment for investment, which is important when negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to complete this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business feels welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property, "said Dalia Grybauskaite.
According to her, the opening of China is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The Lithuanian leader stressed that transparency of investment must be "above the interests of any business group."
"Transparency, the rule of law, strict compliance with international treaties - this must be essential for the environment of new investment relations," - stressed Dalia Grybauskaite.
"The corrupt capital flows should not be welcome in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China's import exhibition is trying to soften criticism that it avoids opening up its market and protects only its companies.
The exhibition is attended by several heads of state, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, China currently ranks 25th among export partners.
Last year, Lithuanian exports to China grew by 50%, which amounted to EUR 180 million.
At the same time, imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials are worried that Chinese investment in Lithuania could bring unwanted political influence, and Beijing's exclusive attention to Eastern Europe divides the unity of the EU.

The cause of the Lion Air plane crash has been revealed: the relatives of the dead are angry
Data from the black box of the crashed Indonesian airline Lion Air show that a malfunction of the speed meter occurred in at least its last four flights, researchers reported on Monday.
Soerjant Tjahjon, Chairman of the National Transport Security Committee (NTSK), said that a similar roll occurred during the last four aircraft flights, including the fatal one, when the liner fell in the Java Sea immediately after the take-off from Jakarta on 29 October.
All 189 people on board the plane were killed in this crash.
Many media reported problems during the previous Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, actually the technical problem was the speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane," Tjahono said during a press conference.
"The black box data showed that during the two flights before the trip, Denpasar-Jakarta was also the same problem," he added.
"There are a lot of rumours circulating on social media.
We now want to explain that in the black box (data remained) about four flights during which there were problems with the air speed meter, "- stated the head of the NTSK.
During a meeting with members of the families of those who died, Mr Tjahono said that the information of the device recording flight data was in line with reports that the aircraft had irregular changes in the speed and height of the last flight.
Search teams have not yet found a second black box recording conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air pointed out that when a technical failure was detected during the flight from Bali to Jakarta, it was repaired in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
Rusdi Kirana, one of the founders of the company, was not invited to speak to the Minister of Transport Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated a meeting of family members with officials supervising the search for the remains of the aircraft and the victims and the investigation of the disaster.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving members of the families demanded that Mr Kirana, together with his brother Kusnan, who founded Lion Air in 1999, present himself.
Lion Air did not behave properly, "said one man who presented himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island to which the plane flew.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he stressed.
- Lion Air has never contacted me since the beginning of the crisis.
We lost our child, but Lion Air did not show us any compassion. "
After this meeting, Mr Kirana hastily left, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are awaiting the results of the long process of identifying the dead.
Almost 140 corpse bags loaded with parts of human remains have been handed over to police medical experts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
The relatives asked why the liner launched two months ago was allowed to fly, even though during the 28 October flight from Bali to Jakarta there was a failure, among other things, which led to passengers frightened by the sudden decline of the plane down immediately after the take-off.
Lion Air said this failure had been removed.
Is it true that the problem was solved? "the son of one of the dead asked.
- If not, the relevant technicians must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, not they said that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must respond in accordance with the law so that aircraft catastrophes in Indonesia do not happen again.
Mr Tjahjon said that a large amount of small debris and the fact that debris spread in a relatively small area show that the liner probably crashed into the water flying at a very high speed.
'The plane was seamless when it fell into the sea.
It did not explode in the air, and the aircraft engines, when it touched the water, were operating in large turns, as shown by all the broken turbine blades', the official explained.
The Lion Air liner crash is the largest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died when a Garuda aircraft crashed near Medan.
After the accident, rescuers led from the debris: a minor was also affected
On Monday evening on the road Vėžaičiai - Plungė, cars BMW and Mercedes-Benz met near Tilvikai.
The cars collided with a cactomusa and three affected people are reported.
It is reported that the BMW driver, born in 1999, went to the opposite side of the traffic and the cactomusa resorted to the car Mercedes-Benz, which was held by a dad, born in 1967, and a daughter born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued from the wreckage by firefighters - rescuers.
A girl from Mercedes-Benz has had her teeth knocked out in an accident.
All the victims were taken to hospital.
President: no artificial relief is needed as a result of the referendum
After the Seimas approved the proposal of those in power to reduce the referendum bar for the first section of the Constitution, which currently has greater protection, the President will veto the amendments, says her advisor Mindaugas Lingė.
'More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that is the requirement.
This and its amendment, especially the articles in its first section, should certainly not be a smaller majority.
It is easy to predict that the President would certainly veto ', said Dalia Grybauskaite's internal political advisor to the Knowledge Radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamental subjects of the state - the language, the flag, the territory, the capital, the sovereignty of the state, so reducing the necessary number of votes to replace these articles, according to Mr Lingė, would create a 'negative precedent' and 'open up uncontrolled risks'.
'In the opinion of the President, there is no need for any artificial relief, it is more necessary to prepare for the referendum itself, more dialogue with the people is needed ', he said.
The Seimas plans to vote on the adoption of an amendment to the Referendum Law on Tuesday.
It provides that a decision on amendments to the first and fourteenth paragraphs of the Constitution with higher protection is taken if at least two fifths of citizens with suffrage agree to this during the referendum.
Currently, more than half of all citizens with the right to vote can change the articles of the first and fourteenth section of the Constitution by referendum.
Around 2.5 million citizens have suffrage in Lithuania: half would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths a million voters.
This proposal was born after the Seimas approved the President's veto in September on amendments previously adopted in parliament, which relaxed the requirements on the number of votes in changing Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution defining citizenship.
The bar for the referendum is proposed to be reduced in the run-up to the referendum on dual citizenship and should take place on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential elections are planned.
Those who migrated after the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990 cannot currently, with some exceptions, have dual citizenship.
Double citizenship is sought by the world "s Lithuanian community, but fears that a referendum would not take place under the current conditions - a sufficient number of people would not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "braška," so they need to be updated
Lithuanian airport and road infrastructure is starting to crush, so it needs to be updated, says Minister of Transport Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius airport is a minimum task that the state must perform.
"Air transport infrastructure is already strawberry because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius airport - this does not even fall into distant planning, that is the minimum we must do, "said Mr Masiulis at the transport conference organised by the Democracy Development Fund and the magazine" State "on Tuesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the external port of Klaipėda was completed, Vilnius and Kaunas airports were renovated and perhaps a new airport was built.
"The next decade will be very important - we have to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of an external port in Klaipėda, arrange airports, perhaps decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, already start projects that will exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years' time, "the Minister for Transport and Communications said.
Mr Masiulis reiterated that too little money has been allocated to the maintenance of car roads in recent years.
"The state of the roads is not yet improving, as insufficient funds are being allocated.
We are predicting to build new roads, but even for essential maintenance, such as expressways, there is a lack of funds.
We must determine the amount of how much should be allocated to road maintenance if we want their condition to improve ', Mr Masiulis said.
He stressed that exports of Lithuanian transport sector services increased by 18.6% this year, and the largest export market became Germany, bypassing Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal, according to which EU carriers will be obliged to periodically return tractors to the country of registration.
"We must strive to make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposal for tractors to go home on a permanent basis is absurd, because there would be empty trucks in Europe, burning fuel and increasing emissions.
The railways will win the most from this, because the costs will increase to such an extent that part of the transport will move to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions', Mr Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the transport sector accounts for 12.2%.
Lithuania's gross domestic product (GDP).
It has more than 118,000 employees and has more than 7.500 companies.
Dispute with heritage guards
Last week, Mr. Masiulis announced in the Seimas Economic Committee that he had started negotiations on changing the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building, which would allow the demolition of the old terminal and the construction of a new one.
However, Algimantas Degutis, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD), called the deliberations of Mr. Masiulis political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the 1950s is a value entered in the register in 1993, and not politicians, but specialists have to decide on its removal.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to the improvement of Lithuania "s image.
"To pull that old terminal out of the heritage would be a politically important step to demolish it and build a new modern arrival terminal in order to feel in a modern country when it comes to Vilnius, and not in an interesting country that really does not represent our country as innovative," said Mr Masiulis at the Seimas last week.
Mr Masiulis then also announced that it is planned to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and to connect the airport with the Rail Baltica track by building an underground station.
This transport node should operate in 2026 after the completion of the construction of Rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius airport served about 3.7 million people, 4.8 million passengers are expected this year and 5 million next year.
Kaunas airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers last year.

Next year Vilnius will start direct flights to Madagascar
In the spring of next year, the largest regular passenger plane Boeing 767 will land at Vilnius airport, which will fly travellers from Lithuania directly to the island of Bė belonging to Madagascar, based on the information of the tour operator Itaka Lietuva writes the portal madeinvilnius.lt.
It is announced that Blue Panorama airlines passengers will be able to choose from 259 economy class and 8 business class seats.
The new holiday destination will be reached directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominic Milowski, CEO of Itaka Lietuva, says that he is trying to offer new holiday destinations to tourists from Lithuania.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
New holiday destinations have also been prepared by other tour operators for the 2019 summer season.
For example, Novaturas and Itaka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister for Finance about a possible crisis: it is important not to talk about the disease
"We always have to prepare for more difficult times.
What I want to welcome is that for the third year in a row for the first time in the history of Lithuania we accumulate reserves.
But it is also very important not to talk about the disease ', Mr Šapoka said during his visit to Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday the Minister of Finance and Vice-Minister Miglė Tuskienė attend meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed that there should be an agreement on how revenues from the provision of certain digital services in EU Member States should be taxed, as long as there is no consensus at global level.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the Italian draft budget as not complying with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC has taken advantage of this opportunity for it.
Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain have been asked for more information.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the issues of deepening Economic and Monetary Union: the possibilities of implementing the European Deposit Insurance Scheme and the reforms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports the stronger role of the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is believed that the functions of the ESM must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the functions of the ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Buračas.
Lithuanian working traditions and customs
Recently it was 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicler, ethnographer and ethnographer Balys Buračas (1897-1972) in Sidariai, Šiauliai parish, the then Šiauliai province.
Celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian state, we have a great opportunity to remember how the national revival filled with life called many Lithuanian people, including brothers Buračus - Bali, Jonas, Broniai - from the depths of the village itself, we can get involved in the fostering, meaning and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Buračas, who travelled around his native land in more than 50 years with a camera in his hands, presented a wide and realistic picture of the customs, traditions, folk art and material culture of our country.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing beds of national culture and had a rare ability to understand the residual value of his work.
In the photographs of Balys Buračas, the Lithuanian landscape, castle mounds, our people perpetuated in the daily and festive environment decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication contains a significant part of the heritage of Balys Buračas dedicated to the description of national labour customs and related traditions and, above all, their attractive iconography.
The material published shows not only the specificity and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilisation over the last century, despite two world wars and a difficult occupation.
The manuscript of the book is particularly full of descriptions written by interwar Samogitia, especially kupiškėnai, šiaulėnai, telšiškės, as well as the inhabitants of Aukštaitija and Dzūkija, their holidays and other traditions and customs Balys Buračas.
Of the approximately 10,000 negatives stored in museums and archives, over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photos were selected for this publication, which are grouped according to selected texts.
They reflect unique aspects of ethnic culture typical of kupiškėnai, dzukai and other districts of Aukštaitija and Samogitia.

Tragic fate of the couple: died after just a few hours of marriage
A helicopter crash in the south-west of the US state of Texas killed a newlywed couple who married just a few hours earlier.
William Troy Byler, 24, and his co-wife, Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, died on Sunday shortly after midnight when a helicopter entered a hill 16 km northwest of Juvaldi and 129 km west of San Antonio, said local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
Surprisingly, the disaster occurred after flying about 24 kilometres, exactly as much as the newlyweds were years old.
Helicopter pilot Gerald Douglas Lawrence, 76, also died.
The newlyweds studied at Sam Houston State University, based in the city of Huntsville, Texas.
They married on Saturday evening at the Byller family ranch near Juvaldi and flew in a family-owned helicopter after the wedding celebration.
The disaster occurred when the helicopter flew about 24 kilometres.
The newlyweds flew to Sant Antonio International Airport, where they intended to get on a plane and fly for a honeymoon, Ms Kennedy said, without specifying the final destination of the couple's trip.
"It is a very rocky, uneven terrain, and that hill is about 120 to 150 metres high," Ms Kennedy said.
Mr Lawrence has manned the aircraft of that family for many years.
According to Mr Kennedy, he manned helicopters and serving in Vietnam.
The autopsy should reveal what the pilot's physical condition was and whether it could not become the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5 to 10 minutes after takeoff.
His debris was within a wide radius on the rocky slope of the hill, and the corps remained "dangerously hanging," said flight safety investigator Craig Hatch from the National Transport Security Board (NTSB) at a press conference on Monday.
Investigators intend to transport the wreckage and then examine them thoroughly, but it will not be easy for the tractor and truck to reach that place, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been determined, and a preliminary report from the NTSB is expected to be published in two weeks' time.
Israeli Prime Minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions against Iran a "historic day"
"Today is a historic day," Netanyahu told MPs of his Likud party, his office reported.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, the US imposes particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the strictest sanctions against Iran in all the time when efforts to curb its aggression began," the head of the Israeli Government said.
Earlier on Monday, the Israeli Minister for Defence, Avigdor Lieberman, stated that the new sanctions would deal a 'decisive' blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls' the strictest sanctions of all time 'were introduced following Mr Trumpo's May and controversial decision to withdraw from the world powers agreement with Tehran on its nuclear programme.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which have already slumped by about a million barrels a day since May, and cut Tehran off from international financing.
Israel has long opposed the aforementioned agreement with Iran and says its scope and deadlines are too limited.
The Jewish state also says that the lifting of sanctions has made it possible for Iran to finance militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly worried about Iran's actions in neighboring Syria and has vowed to prevent it from establishing itself militarily there.
Other participants in the agreement with Iran - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - do not support the US decision and say that the agreement, as envisaged, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court again explores the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
In the case of the accident that resulted in the death of a young motorcycle rider in Vilnius, North town, the court will hear the testimony of the witness.
The Vilnius Regional Court decided on Tuesday that in order to find out all the significant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses of the case will be questioned at the next meeting on 26 November.
An acquittal verdict has already been issued in this case, but the prosecutor's office does not agree with it.
On August 22, the District Court of Vilnius acquitted the car driver of the death of a motorcycle accident, announcing 79-year-old Eduard Osipov that the motorcyclist travelled at high speed in the city and committed a serious violation.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor "s Office asks the Regional Court to annul the verdict of the District Court and states that E. Osipov is the most to blame for the accident, and the conclusions of the District Court are unfounded.
The family lawyer of the dead motorcyclist is also asking for the annulment of the conviction.
The accident took place on 11 August 2015 at about 15: 00, when the car driven by E. Osipov Škoda Fabia from Lakūnų Street entered Žirmūnų Street and faced a motorcycle on the main road.
The Prosecutor "s Office accused the man that the car driver violated road traffic rules intended to give the road and caused a traffic accident, resulting in the death of a man travelling on the main road motorcycle Piaggo.
The initial police reports stated that the scooter driver died, but later after investigations, it was found that the vehicle was equated to a motorcycle in terms of power.
Rolandas Bužinskas BNS, judge of the District Court of Vilnius, said that the experts found that the motorcycle driver drove at a speed of 89.2 kilometres per hour, even though the permissible speed in that place is 50 kilometres per hour.
"The driver of the car could not have foreseen that the motorcycle would drive at such a high speed," the judge said.
At that time, the driver of a car of venerable age claimed to have travelled at a speed of just 5-6 kilometres per hour.
When he saw the obstacle, the motorcycle driver tried to stop and fell from the vehicle before facing "Škoda Fabia."
The Prosecutor's Office believes that Mr Osipov, who travelled from the side to the main road, had to give way to the motorcyclist.
Novaya Gazeta: six Wagner mercenaries died in Syria
Among the dead are five Syrian military soldiers and six persons belonging to the military company Wagner.
This is announced by the source of Novaya Gazeta in Syria.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5th Syrian Military Corps was deployed in the aforementioned area, which was joined by a number of Syrian volunteers and "military mercenaries."
Novaya Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a request for information on the fate of the Russians.
The former Belgian king will have to take a paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for the artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking to be recognised as a child of the former monarch since 2013.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II had a short love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies parenthood.
According to the station RTBF, it can go to the Supreme Court in opposition to a DNA test.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel - the former husband of Delphine's mother - is not the father of the artist either in biological or legal terms.
Delphine appealed for the relevant investigation so that the daughter of the 'real' father Albert could be recognised.
HEC parties will distribute money, but social workers will not give anything
The Central Electoral Commission (HEC) intends to distribute a budget grant amounting to almost EUR 3 million to the largest political parties this week.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP) established this spring, led by the Vice-President of the Parliament Gediminas Kirkilas, is not yet foreseen to allocate funds from the budget.
But they can be allocated in the near future by a separate HEC decision if the legal environment governing the distribution of grants to parties changes.
Laura Matjošaitytė, HEC President, informed the VŽ that "a meeting of the commission is planned this Thursday, where it is planned to take a decision on the distribution of the budget semi-annual grant to parties."
According to her, HEC must make a decision on this issue by 15 November.
It is planned to distribute EUR 2.751 million to seven parties, six of which are parliamentary.
The opposition Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than EUR 0.66 million, the ruling Peasants and Green Union - about EUR 0.55 million, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about EUR 0.5 million, the opposition Liberal Movement - almost EUR 0.4 million, the Labour Party, which does not have its own group in the Seimas - about EUR 0.23 million, the Sustainable and Justice Party, which recently joined the ruling - almost EUR 0.22 million, represented in parliament, but neither the ruling nor the opposition non-proclaimed Polish Electoral Action - the Union of Christian Families - about EUR 0.18 million.
According to the current law, which will be followed by HEC when distributing budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes during the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow only the LSDDP established in spring this year to expect to receive money from the budget.
This party has not yet participated in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers receive at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the run-up to the three elections next year - self-government, the President and the European Parliament.
The relevant amendments to political parties and this year's budget laws adopted by the Seimas were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaite.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the representatives of those in power, Mr Kirkilas and Ramūnas Karbauskis, the leader of the peasant greens, believe that parliamentarians will seek to reject the objections of the President.
However, this will not be done before this Thursday's HEC meeting, so according to Mr. Matjošaitytė, "grants will be distributed according to the legal procedure that has existed so far."
It is true that the HEC leader did not reject that if the Seimas rejects the President's veto this or next week and new amendments on the allocation of budget funds to parties enter into force, the commission may consider a decision on the allocation of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"In making our decision, we will take into account the entire current legal environment, because we are an executive body that has to implement the laws being adopted," she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject the veto and the new laws enter into force, additional money would be allocated to the parties by the government, which borrowed additional amounts.
The grants already distributed to seven parties would not suffer as a result of such a decision.

Poroshenko: customers of the murder of activist Handziuk must be punished
'I want to state that no version - and there are more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each will be checked very thoroughly, in accordance with the investigation procedures.
I as president do not have the opportunity, and I am not obliged, to obtain information that could undermine the course of the investigation.
However, the authorities must ensure transparency and law enforcement agencies must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to learn the truth and punish evil ', said Poroshenko at a meeting with young people on Tuesday in Kiev.
He stressed that he was most interested in explaining the murder of Mr Handziuk and that the killers, the organisers and customers of the crime 'take the necessary responsibility'.
'After this case was reclassified as a murder (case), they are quite rightly and rightly threatened with a life sentence ', the President of Ukraine said.
He was right to call the public's demand for an open and impartial investigation of this case.
Poroshenko stressed that the speeches of representatives of law enforcement authorities in parliament should show that 'the government is determined to bring criminals and killers to justice, whoever they are'.
He also said that political speculation on the topic would not help to clarify the situation, but would further confuse everything.
"I call on all forces, both the government and the opposition, not to waste unfounded arguments and, defend God, not to use this murder for public relations," the President said.
- On the contrary, we must now unite to ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, rapid - one that raises public confidence.
There's just no other way for us. '
'No one will be allowed to use this situation to destabilise the situation in the country ', he assured.
Handziuk, who fought against corruption, was attacked and flooded with acid in Kherson in July.
She was an advisor to the mayor of this southern city of Ukraine.
The woman was hospitalised after the attack, but died in hospital on Sunday.
After the police and prosecutors did not explain the perpetrators of this attack, the Attorney General of Ukraine, Yuri Lucenka, submitted a resignation statement on Tuesday.
After her death, government officials received accusations from public activists that they were unable to conduct the investigation properly.
Activists have also called for the resignation of the prosecutor general and interior minister.
'I am submitting my resignation statement today ', Mr Lucenka reported to members of parliament, reading his investigation report.
Parliament has yet to approve the prosecutor's resignation.
Mr Lucenka accused activists of putting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, so it is difficult to identify the perpetrators of the murder of Mr Handziuk.
Bill Gates introduced a water-free toilet
Presenting the futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional such devices to without water supply with the computer revolution of the 1970s.
Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, presented a high-tech toilet that does not need water in water pipes at an exhibition in Beijing, Reuters reported.
Toilet without water works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of wastewater are processed into chemical fertiliser.
'The technologies you see here are the greatest achievements in the field of sanitation in the last 200 years' - Bill Gates was quoted by Bloomberg.
The technological toilet was created with the funds of a charity fund established by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Over seven years, work has been carried out on a device that could turn human waste into fertiliser or water, for which the fund spent USD 200 million.
In total, in the words of Bill Gates, about 20 toilet models were developed.
The facility is now complete and could be put up for sale.
However, so that such toilets can be produced en masse, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500 thousand children under the age of five die every year as a result of poor sanitation conditions.
The fight against the problems caused by poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, is increasing the money spent on health, which already amounts to 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitation situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates to the presentation of the toilet in a jar with faeces.
According to him, this is a good reminder that in a small example "there may be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100 thousand worm parasite eggs."

Anxiety in France: human deaths are of concern
French health officials on Monday announced a permanent ban on the widely used pesticide, amid concerns about several dozen people with recent poisoning in the west of the country.
The health agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all products containing pesticide was taken after a new safety inspection launched earlier this year, even before at least three waves of poisoning at the Department of Art and Loire, which began in September.
As a result of these cases, the government had already suspended the use of the pesticide.
This soil disinfection chemical should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
To be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, around 700 tonnes were used every year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, in the Angers region, where many salad juices are grown, complained about the thinning of the eyes and throat and respiratory problems.
"These episodes confirm the justice of our decision, but they did not rush it," Francoise Weber, Deputy Director of ANSES, told the newspaper Ouest France on Monday.
Metam, one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and Europe, is regarded by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) as' a likely human carcinogen '.
This pesticide, sold under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is allowed in Europe until 2022, when a new safety check is to be carried out.
"There was no choice but to remove it from the market, regardless of whether there are alternatives to it," Mr Weber told the newspaper in question.
"We understand what difficulties there will be for salad broth growers, general farmers, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to halt the use of metam in the region, whose economy relies heavily on intensive agriculture.
More than half of the 35 000 tonnes of salad juice consumed in Europe every year are grown in this region near Nantes.
Next season there will be 'much less salad juice, radishes and couples' last month, when the government suspended the use of metam, Philippe Retiere, head of the Nantes Producers Federation, told AFP.

President Paul Biya sworn in for a seventh term in Cameroon after controversial elections
At a ceremony overseen by Parliament Speaker Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, Mr. Biya, 85, promised to protect the "integrity and unity" of the West African state.
The oldest President in Africa, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was declared the winner in the elections on 7 October, collecting 71% of the votes.
However, the elections were overshadowed by low turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Mr. Biya's inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the principal, were abducted at one Presbyterian school in the North West region, where English-speaking separatists are conducting an armed campaign for independence.
Most of the 22 million people in Cameroon are French speakers and a fifth are English speakers.
In 2016, in the province of the North West and neighbouring South West, there was a demand for autonomy in the event of dissatisfaction with alleged discrimination in the fields of education, courts and the economy.
In 2017, when Mr. Biya refused to indulge, the radicals declared an independent state, the "Republic of Ambazonia," and raised their weapons.
At least 400 civilians and more than 175 security force officers have been killed in separatist attacks and government retaliation operations this year, according to non-governmental organizations.
More than 300 000 people have fled from violence: some across the border to Nigeria, but many are forced to live in semi-hunger in the forests.
During the elections in October, just 5% of voters voted in the North West and 15% of the electorate in the South West.
In both parts of the country, Mr. Biya received two-thirds of the vote.
Conservative primary elections: mistakes were caused by inexperience
"Something was missing in some places - understand that the party organised everything with its resources.
Some municipalities allowed their premises to be used, but there were no polling booths everywhere because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank you to those who lent, "the politician said.
According to him, complaints have been received, but their content does not change their substance, and the infringements themselves are not malignant in nature.
"" There were complaints.
Not all the people who took part in the elections were experienced - it was also news to them.
So from that inexperience, not all actions were in line with our procedures.
It was therefore necessary to warn from the CoR that it would comply with the principles we described.
These complaints still do not give reason to doubt the results, "- said A. Anušauskas.
According to the President of the CoR, there have been cases where ballot papers were unstamped - after learning of this, the ballot papers found in the ballot boxes without a stamp were cancelled.
There was a lack of space in some towns, but according to A. Anušauskas, complaints and violations relate to several dozen bulletins.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, it really does not make a fundamental difference to the results of the elections," - explained A. Anušauskas.
It is claimed that the turnout of party members in the elections was 55%, while the turnout of non-party voters was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked on commissions.
The results published on Sunday also do not change - 79% of the voters (16418 votes) voted in favour of the winning Ingrida Šimonytė, while 21% voted in favour of Vygaudas Ušackas (4441 votes).
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will officially support Mrs Šimonytė's candidacy in the country's presidential elections in May next year.
Short says he probably won't meet Putin in Paris
White House national security adviser John Bolton said earlier that Trump would meet Putin in Paris, where events to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War will take place this week.
However, leaving for the last rallies before the mid-term elections of the US Congress, Mr Brief told journalists that he was not sure whether this would be an appropriate opportunity to meet the Russian President.
'I'm not sure if we're going to meet in Paris.
Probably not, "the US president noted.
However, added the head of the White House, they will meet at the G-20 summit and 'will probably meet many times' afterwards.
Mr Brief is still trying to 'reload' relations with Moscow, despite suspicions that Russia intervened in the 2016 US presidential elections.
Kęstutis Strupas asks for the annulment of the VTEK decision
Kęstutis Strupas, former Director General of Santara Clinics of Vilnius University, asks for the annulment of the decision of the High Official Ethics Commission (VTEK), which acknowledged that transactions were not declared in time and thus violated the law.
K. Strupas "complaint was examined by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be published on 26 November.
The applicant asks for the annulment of the VTEK decision of 23 May, BNS reported the court representative Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduonė.
Mr Strupas believes that gifts given to relatives must not be declared, and he says he has understood the exception to the law in this way.
VTEK announced in May that K. Strupas, Director General of Santara Clinics, and Silvija Strupienė, Head of the Outpatient Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
The investigation found that four transactions were declared without complying with the planned deadlines: a loan taken with the spouse from the bank in 2010, the acquisition of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift given to the daughter in 2017 - an apartment and a loan to a natural person in 1996 together with the spouse.
S. Strupienė also declared these transactions by passing deadlines.
Persons who have violated the law on the harmonisation of public and private interests in the public service cannot be encouraged for a year.
The law obliges you to declare not only its own data, but also the data of the spouse.
The study was carried out by VTEK on the basis of "Info TV" television information.
It was explained whether K. Strupas and his spouse, S. Strupienė, Head of the Outpatient Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, declared their transactions properly and in time.
As announced by "Info TV," last year K. Strupas gave his daughter real estate worth 125 thousand euros.
However, the former head of Santara clinics and his wife had not indicated the aforementioned data in their declarations of interests.
Law enforcement for K. Strupas, together with at least ten more persons, has made allegations in a corruption investigation - according to law enforcement, the winning public procurement of computers and software in clinics required illegal financial remuneration from companies and is disguised as support.
In this way, Strupas is suspected of having consulted at least five times during public procurement in the field of information technology in Santara clinics.
Mr Strupas himself denies his guilt.
Professor Strupas, suspected of corruption, was dismissed from the position of head of Santara clinics in September.
According to the decision of the Ministry of Health and Vilnius University, labour relations with K. Strupai were terminated at his own request.
He has led the hospital since 10 November 2013.
Santara clinics continue to be temporarily led by Professor Juozas Raistenskis until the contest to elect a new Director General takes place, it is promised to be announced this year.

Schools already want to teach differently: they promise fewer tests, more practice
Such changes in educational content are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them at the forum "Change of Education Content: Foreign Experience for Solutions in Lithuania," which took place in Vilnius on Monday.
Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė, who spoke at the discussion, said that over EUR 30 million has been invested in the renewal of educational content over the last ten years, but the results are not visible.
"According to the results of the international student achievement study PISA, the achievements of students are below the average of OECD countries," said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė.
The report of the Ministry of Education and Science cites OECD expert Phil Lambert (Phil Lambert) said that Lithuania is too focused on providing knowledge and not on the practical application of knowledge.
According to him, general education programmes in Lithuania focus on the development of students "literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but it is also needed to develop children" s creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy and empathy.
Vice-Minister of Education and Science Gražvydas Kazakevičius, presenting changes in the content of general education, said that the volume of updated programmes started this school year will decrease, they will be more specific and disciplines will be more strongly linked to each other.
According to the Vice-Minister, students "education will be more individualized, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare from 10% to 30% of their unique educational content, the current student assessment system will change to a cumulative score, and the student" s competence acquired in an informal way will also gain more weight.
The number of standardized tests will decrease.
It is promised that general education programmes will be digital, convenient to use, linked to e-resources and a task bank.
The aim of updating the content of education is to improve students' achievements in the international PISA study by at least 10%, to reduce the gap between students' achievements by a third, students to acquire modern competences at school and to be literate in various areas.
Lithuania plans to allocate EUR 7.8 million from the European Union and the state budget to update the content of education from May 2018.
The project of updated general education programmes in the 2019-2020 school year is expected to be tested in some schools and will be launched in all schools from September 2021.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry received criticism of a project worth almost EUR 8 million carried out by the Education Development Centre for the renewal of general programmes for primary, basic and secondary education.
EUR 7.8 million is planned for this for four years, and the first purchase of EUR 1.3 million was announced at the beginning of October to search for the organisers of education programmes.
After the experts criticised this purchase, it was suspended, Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskienė dismissed Giedrius Vaidelis, Director of the Education Development Centre, from her duties.
Lithuania - exercises on how to respond to extreme flooding
A ten-day exercise begins in Lithuania on Monday to improve the response of institutions to extreme flooding.
As reported by the Fire and Rescue Department (PRT-13), the exercise will check how state institutions are prepared to work in the country following the declaration of a state-level emergency, such as the flood: to eliminate its consequences, to coordinate the search, rescue and rapid eviction of people from flooded areas, to organise their provision of drinking water, food, to ensure the necessary energy supply and to take care of other measures to protect the population.
More than 100 representatives from all ministries of the country, other institutions, as well as members of 12 municipal emergency operations centres will participate in the exercise.
On 5-13 November, a preparatory stage of the exercise will take place, during which the municipalities, which received information from the Hydrometeorological Service from the PRT-16 about continuous precipitation and the beginning of the flood, will take decisions on emergency management.
The active phase of the exercise is planned for 14-15 November.
During it, there will be a State Emergency Operations Centre in the Department and institutional emergency operations centres in state and municipal institutions.
When the government declares a state-level emergency due to the consequences of flooding, the head of operations appointed by the Prime Minister will lead the liquidation of the emergency, the elimination of its consequences, and the protection and rescue of the population and assets.
Mindaugas Kanapickas, Deputy Director of PRT-13, says that the most important thing in the exercise is to check the readiness of institutions to perform statutory functions, to evaluate the possibilities to exchange information, to check how it is prepared to warn and inform residents, state and municipal institutions, institutions and companies about the impending disaster and to "improve the emergency management skills of state institutions."
The exercise will also demonstrate the joint capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian fire-fighters to pump a huge amount of water from flooded areas.
For this purpose, the module BaltFloodCombat was established in 2009.
Attorney General of Ukraine Yuri Lucenka resigns
The Attorney General of Ukraine, Yuri Lucenka, speaking in the country's parliament on Tuesday, announced his resignation due to the resonance caused by the death of the acid-filled anti-corruption fighter Katerina Gandziuk, according to the Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
According to Ukrainian law, the Attorney General must submit a request for resignation to the President of the country, and he must submit to the Verkhovna Rada for approval by a majority.
On Tuesday, Attorney General Lucenko presented the progress and results of the law enforcement investigation into the order of the murder of K. Gandziuk in Verkhovna Rada.
In a speech to parliamentarians, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed his indignation that Mr Gandziuk's death was being exploited for the public relations of politicians.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian activist, a fighter against corruption who spoke publicly about police corruption in her native southern Ukrainian city of Kherson.
On 31 July, an unknown attacker K. Gandziuk shouted acid in her face near her home.
On 4 November, she died in hospital as a result of her injuries.

According to J. Lucenkas, the law enforcement investigation includes 12 persons possibly related to the order of the murder of K. Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the investigation was leaked to the media, which threatens the success of the investigation.
According to the Attorney General, due to the leak of information, the suspects received them essential knowledge.
Mr Lucenko added that he knew Mr Gandziuk personally and was outraged that some politicians were exploiting her blood for public relations.
"So that no one has any reason to say that someone is clinging to power, I want to state that I am making a statement to resign.
Today, I will submit it to the President of Ukraine and you will have to discuss this issue in parliament '- Mr Lucenk's speech in Rada is quoted by the publication' Obozrevatel '.
It is written that Mr Lucenko added that 'he cannot allow two-rule in the country when the law enforcement system is destroyed without any evidence, even for revealed crimes'.
Mr Lucenko is considered a close friend of the President of the country, Peter Poroshenko.
He was appointed Attorney General on 12 May 2016 after protracted attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, suspected of covering up corruption of top-level officials and politicians, from this post.
Minister of Energy Ž. Vaičiūnas meets representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As Elta was informed by the advisor to the Minister of Energy Aurelija Vernickaitė, the meeting will discuss the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and after 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector that does not currently reach the aggregated trajectories set out in the national renewable energy action plans at EU level, with a 6% share of renewable energy in 2015.
The EC estimates that progress towards the mandatory 10% target in the transport sector is quite slow due to various difficulties, including the relatively high costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector mainly comes from biofuels (88%), and electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.
The Seimas took a proposal to supplement corruption investigation issues with a Conservative appeal to the CT
On Tuesday after the presentation, the Seimas approved such a proposal registered by Agnė Širinskienė, a "peasant" leading the investigation into illegal influence on political processes.
58 members of the Seimas were in favour, 27 against and nine abstentions.
The project will continue to be discussed by the Seimas committees, the main appointed Committee on Legal and Law Enforcement led by A. Širinskienė.
Following its conclusion, the adoption of an amendment to the resolution will be voted on.
Currently, the Interim Investigation Commission of the Seimas carrying out a new investigation of political corruption is ordered to explain the possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
A. Širinskienė proposed to extend this term by stating that "significant information about possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and state institutions appeared in the public space."
A. Širinskienė identifies in the project "possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or applying to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of significant independent institutions such as the Chief Official Ethics Commission."
The appeal to the Constitutional Court on pensions was initiated by opposition Conservatives.
The ruling 'peasants' found that Conservatives were based to a large extent on the arguments of private pension fund lawyers in their appeal.
With the impact on the Chief Official Ethics Commission (VTEK), the leaders of the 'peasants' accuse the former friend Povilas Urbšis.
According to them, the former chairman of the Seimas Committee on State Administration and Municipalities could instruct VTEK members to dismiss Mindaugas Siauris, former head of the Prevention Division of the Commission, from their duties.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission to explain the possibly illegal influence of stakeholders or their groups, the impact on the course of elections, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary groups, individual politicians, the activities and funding of parties and public movements, legislative processes, the election and appointment of members of state-owned companies, heads of public institutions, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to look at what information law enforcement and intelligence authorities provided to the competent authorities and how it was responded.
The researchers are expected to present their findings by May 1 next year.
At that time, there will be an election campaign for the President, the European Parliament.
Of the 12 members of the commission, seven are representatives of "peasants."
Its members also appointed two social workers, one "barn, a" liberal and a representative of the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania and the Union of Christian Families.
Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to participate in the work of the commission.
The new investigation was initiated by Ramūnas Karbauskis, chairman of the ruling Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union.
According to him, the investigation by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSGK) carried out last session, mainly on the same things, showed that the investigation needed to continue.
The head of German domestic intelligence lost his post
Mr Maassen, 55, also fuelled the control version by stating that 'radical left-wing forces' in Mrs Merkel's coalition were to blame for his problems.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as previously promised, but forced to go into reserve.
Among other things, it became clear last weekend that, at a meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence organisations in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Mr Maassen criticised Mrs Merkel's' naive 'immigration policy.
The German Minister for the Interior, Horst Seehofer, who defended the head of intelligence for a long time, stated at a press conference on Monday that Mr Maassen's recent comments were unacceptable and 'disappointed him personally'.
Mr Seehofer, who himself received pressure as a result of both this dispute and the poor performance of his party in the Bavarian local elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release Mr Maassen into reserve.

Body girls destroy stereotypes about wedding dresses
A plump girl with a white fluffy bride dress - mission (not) possible?
Can a white swan sailing towards the altar be larger than the size of S or M and still look attractive?
Plus the participants of the size reality show "Size (r) Evolution" will already prove today that the bride "s beauty and elegance really do not depend on a woman" s kilograms.
But that is not all - one of the girls of the project will be touched by tears of happiness this evening - her boyfriend will appear on the filming site.
'There are still those who think the bigger girls don't get the attention or glimpses of the guys.
This is only a myth - my boyfriend himself is an athlete, but he likes what I am, he does not require some standard figure from me, "- Aurika, a participant of the show, will speak before the performance with the wedding dress.
Wedding dress is not light, in every sense, the garment - it is a complex construction, it contains a lot of material, the dress is heavy, inconvenient for movement.
Also, some women believe that a larger girl in a white dress will look even larger and therefore less confident.
I can reassure you that a properly chosen dress model really solves this "problem," explained one of the members of the show commission, fashion designer Robertas Kalinkinas.
R. Kalinkinas decides the fate of girls in the project together with the whole commission - Erika Vitulskiene, who opened a plus size fashion house, photographer and social networking star Naglis Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukštas.
"When deciding which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there are many quarrels between the members of the commission - after all, we all represent different spheres and imagine the winner of the show differently.
The task of demonstrating wedding dresses was made even more difficult by the fact - I can now reveal - that two newcomers appeared, which were certainly not worse than the old men.
It was a special evening in every sense, "- says Mr Kalinkin.
Newcomers - Ieva, who became famous for 23 years of scandalous behaviour in one summer reality show, and Dovilė, a 31-year-old mother of two children of exceptional beauty - like other girls participated in the selection of "Size (r) evolution" and got to the top 20.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo session of girls in the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
LNK viewers returned the girls to the show, who voted for their favourites on the television portal.
Having received international recognition, the reality show of body beauties has been taking place in Lithuania for the second week - here plus size girls are competing for the name of the first plus size star in the country.
So far there are only eight of them left - and they are all well aware that only one will be able to be the winner.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show "The Evolution of Size (r)" starts this Monday evening at 20.30 through LNK.

Those in power no longer require a distance of 20 km in the construction of waste incineration plants
Vilnius cogeneration plant is being built, near Gariunai market.
Those in power no longer seek to maintain a distance of 20 kilometres from the settlements during the construction of waste incineration plants.
Kęstutis Mažeika, the head of the Committee on the Environment, registered an amendment to the Law on Waste Management at the Seimas on Monday, which refuses such a requirement.
According to Mr Mažeika, the 'peasants' group, which previously supported the provision for a distance of 20 km, promises to support the amendment on its refusal.
Mr Mažeika's amendment provides that waste incineration plants could be built with statutory environmental and public health requirements from January 2019.
He recognises that the amendments were encouraged by the President's doubts about such a ban.
"Taking into account the definition of a residential area, it is obvious that it would be almost impossible to find a place where it would be possible to build the above objects," the chairman of the committee says.
The ruling majority in October opposed the President's veto amendments strengthening the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste incineration plants closer than 20 km from the settlements, the amendments provided for permission for the government to take decisions on the future of the two power plants already under construction, taking into account the interests of public health.
The latter provisions do not propose to be adjusted by Mr Mažeika.
In Vilnius, a waste and biofuel-fired power plant is built by the energy group "Lietuvos energija," and in Kaunas - together with the Finnish energy concern "Fortum" company "Fortum Heat Lietuva."
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipėda.
There is talk of a possible compromise in Brexit talks
British and Irish leaders discussed a possible compromise on Monday to address the difficult issue of Northern Ireland, which is stuck in the Brexit negotiations, reported Dublin.
Speaking by phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed the possibility of reviewing the so-called backstop agreement mechanism, which would make it possible to leave an open border between the British province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the European Union.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar promised to consider this proposal, but rejected any possibility of Britain unilaterally withdrawing from this agreement, according to a report published by the Irish Government.
In the conversation Th. May 'raised the possibility of reviewing the backstop mechanism', it states.
'Varadkar has made it clear that it is open to a review of new proposals, provided that the result of such a review is not linked to a unilateral decision to terminate the application of insured measures', the government report says.
Brexit negotiators do not find an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the land border between the United Kingdom and Ireland when Britain leaves the single market and customs union in March next year.
Both sides agree on 'insured measures' to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger-scale trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks are not carried out at the border.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to apply temporarily to the whole of the United Kingdom.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is seeking for Britain to withdraw from the backstop agreement unilaterally in three months' time.
However, Mr Varadkar told journalists in Dublin that his government 'cannot support this'.
'The insured measures of three months or a limited period are not worth the paper on which they will be written ', he stated.
In the past, London and Brussels have not confirmed information on the breakthrough in the Brexit negotiations following a report in Britain at the weekend that an agreement is within reach.
'I would say that we continue to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work ', stated Th. May's representative in London.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas also told reporters: "We're not there yet."
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
A group of outstanding thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, issued a declaration on Monday calling for the right to reliable information to be guaranteed in the Internet era.
Among the 25 people who signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Old (Amartja Old) and Joseph Stiglitz (Joseph Stiglitz), the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, as well as the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, writer Mario Vargas Llosa (Marijus Vargas Liosa).
"We call on leaders of good will on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and an open public debate in which citizens can make decisions on the basis of facts," the group's report said.
They argue that the 'global space of information and communication' is a common good that 'must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion'.
"People have a fundamental right to receive information that is freely collected, processed and distributed based on the truth of commitment, the principles of pluralism of approaches and rational methods of establishing facts," added the authors of the declaration.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who often criticises' fake news' but is regularly accused of distorting facts.
World leaders should express their position on this issue when they meet at the Peace Forum in Paris on 11-13 November, urged the signatories.
This declaration was drawn up within two months under the leadership of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deluar, the head of the Paris-based media freedom and journalists' rights organisation Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Among the other signatories are the former President of Senegal, Abdou Diouf (Abdu Diuf), Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
Seimas approved higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Law on Product Safety stipulating that penalties for infringements of product safety must be increased.
The amendments were approved unanimously in the Chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health Affairs, said, when it comes to the new project, it is to be welcomed that the objectives set are related to better protection of product consumers.
In addition, its provisions are adapted to the requirements of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
'In my opinion, the proposed draft law distributes more perfectly and more specifically to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the penalty system currently in force does not always prevent further infringements, because entities that have paid fines continue to commit repeated infringements', Mr Vinkus said.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy and, after the approval of the Government, the Seimas Economic Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim to increase penalties for infringements, to strengthen the protection of consumer rights, to give more power to market surveillance authorities and to create a clear system for monitoring product safety requirements and their compliance.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for manufacturers to label the product properly in order to ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the Ministry, when carrying out state product safety control, market surveillance authorities do not have the right to enter the territory of manufacturers and suppliers, buildings, premises and to carry out checks, which complicates the work of the institutions.
According to the Ministry, the deadline of six months for the imposition of fines and warnings is too short to identify a violation, to carry out an investigation and to impose a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the penalties imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - 14 companies did so in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Economy proposed to impose an obligation on manufacturers to properly label the product, thereby ensuring its traceability in order to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to clarify the suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the right to enter the territory, buildings and premises of economic entities that produce, supply products to the market by carrying out state product safety controls.
It is intended to increase the level of fines for infringements of the law.
The manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who placed dangerous products on the market and the distributor who placed them on the market, the service provider providing or providing dangerous services would be fined between EUR 150 and EUR 2 500 (now from 144 to 1 448).
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (VVTAT) or other market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing and placing on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, it would be fined between EUR 1 000 and EUR 5 000 (now from 868 to 4 344).
Failure to comply with the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of between EUR 2500 and EUR 6 500 (now from 1 448 to 5 792).
If dangerous products have damaged the health of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 2 500 and EUR 15 000 (now from 1 448 to 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 6 500 and EUR 25 000 (now from 5 792 to 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, Poland and Austria impose a fine of up to EUR 25 000 for violation of product safety legislation (the minimum amount of the fine is not set), in Belgium a fine of between EUR 26 and EUR 600 000, in Romania a fine of between EUR 155 and EUR 6 666, and in Bulgaria a fine of between EUR 125 and EUR 7 500.
10-year-old had a baby: was raped by a family member
The event in Colombia stunned millions of people.
A 10-year-old girl raped by her older brother gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby saw the world thanks to the caesarean section, but both the girl and her baby feel good.
For some time they were supervised by medics.
It still has to take some time before the young mother is released home with the child.
"Based on the information I received from police officers, a young age became pregnant after she was sexually abused by a family member - a brother," the director of the hospital where the birth was accepted told one foreign television.
The police are investigating the event of rape and violence against the child.
The Norwegian Armed Battalion took part in NATO exercises in the most remote and northernmost areas
Soldiers from the Norwegian armed forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the country's capital, Oslo.
It is part of the NATO exercise "Tripartite Connection 2018," the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most soldiers from the second Norwegian Military Force Battalion after the September 11 terrorist attacks spent a lot of time away from home, in places such as Afghanistan - that is, in warm lands.
But most of all, they are skilled in fighting under the conditions of the Arctic, and these skills are of great service now that NATO is changing the direction of its attention.
In recent days, in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the most remote and northernmost areas, soldiers have taken part in staged battles against real British troops.
The soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold in the wild, but in a harsh climate they have to drag much more weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers staying at the headquarters say they share their skills on how to survive and fight under such conditions with other NATO soldiers.
According to the soldiers, this exercise, which like no other is particularly reminiscent of real war, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.

Kaunas vicemer does not plan to return to politics
The former Kaunas vicemer Povilas Mačiulis, who left his job in the municipality and the "United Kaunas" organization due to support for Vygaudas Ušackas in the presidential elections, does not plan to return to politics and promises to concentrate on business.
'I'm going to focus on the business.
I am a shareholder in several companies and I also have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be able to welcome the opportunity to devote more time to the family, "- BNS said Mr Mačiulis.
He said he also does not plan to participate in the coming municipal elections.
P. Mačiulis has not yet had the opportunity to talk to V. Ušackas after he lost the initial elections of the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union to Ingrida Šimonytė on Sunday.
"To be honest, we have not yet been able to discuss the results in detail with him and the team and talk about future plans.
It is obvious that when Vygaudas withdrew from the further election fight, this stage of my life is over, "said Mr Mačiulis.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas policy on support for V. Ušackas, only regretted that "Lithuania lost a unique opportunity to have a real leader in the context of international relations."

Workers are cruising in Kaunas castle: what are they doing here?
The people of Kaunas, having noticed the workers working in Kaunas castle, hoped that the reconstruction works of the remaining tower were finally taking place.
For the portal Kaunas.diena.lt Gabriel Sužiedelis, the director of Kaunas City Museum, assured that works of changing the coating of protective roofs of the south-western tower with a fragment of the defensive wall are taking place here.
According to the interlocutor, the roofs will be cans.
"A worn tin coating in an emergency condition threatened the surrounding people - people could fall in and injure themselves - so it was necessary to change it.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so it also damaged heritage, "- explained the director of the museum.
Are these roofs going to be similar to what they were a few centuries ago?
"All works are combined with heritage and other institutions," - G. Traueidėlis added those who want the result to be as authentic as possible, but at the same time the practical side is also important - roofs must protect values from moisture.
When working with heritage, a universal solution was chosen.
Before that, the elements of Kaunas castle were covered with tin even during the Soviet era, so they no longer had historical value, "- detailed the director of Kaunas City Museum.
The work agreement was signed on 2 October.
It is planned that the work will not last more than three months after the signing of the contract.
"It is expected that it will be completed by the end of November," - the director of the museum taught expectations.
According to him, the value of the works carried out amounts to almost EUR 24 thousand.
This amount, according to the interlocutor, was provided for in this year's budget.
Works in Kaunas castle are carried out by the company "Statija."
Kauno. diena.lt has written how, according to the studies carried out, Kaunas castle could have looked earlier.

Eastern Europe Studies Centre will cooperate with two famous US "brain centres"
According to Linas Kojala, the head of EESC, who is based in Vilnius and is already counting the thirteenth year of operation, networking in the USA will allow to implement projects and make Lithuania's voice more audible on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that two large institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that there will be niche activities, because the topics of NATO, security, disinformation and the development of Eastern Partnership countries are also a priority for them, "Kojala said.
The agreements note that EESC and US institutions will work together to prepare applications for international projects, expert experience and knowledge will be exchanged and expert visits will be organised.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have an excellent international reputation.
FPRI has been operating since 1955 and unites almost a hundred top-level analysts.
In the latest global ranking of analytical centers compiled by the University of Pennsylvania, FPRI ranked seventh in its category.
At that time, CEPA, whose analysts were repeatedly invited to advise and work in the highest US political institutions, goes tenth in the same ranking in its category.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to break into the US information space and encourage us to raise the quality bar up," added Kojala.
One of the first practical steps should be the help of partners in distributing the upcoming EESC analytical publication Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review among US decision makers and in the public space.
The Eastern Europe Studies Centre operates on the basis of ongoing projects and is not supported by targeted grants.
Among the EESC partners with which joint initiatives are implemented are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.

Member of Afghan Special Forces shot an American instructor during training
Brent Taylor, the 39-year-old mayor of Nort Ogden, north of Salt Lake City, had taken a year-long leave to carry out a mission in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer for the United Force Staff but was due to return to work as mayor in January.
Another member of the US army, whose name has not yet been made public, was injured during the attack on Saturday, which claimed the life of Mr Taylor.
According to officials, Mr Taylor died of infantry weapons fire.
Major General Jefferson S. Burton, commander of the Utah National Guard, told journalists that Taylor helped to train and strengthen the capabilities of the Afghan national army.
Utah media quoted a NATO report that Taylor was shot by one of the trained special forces soldiers and that the attacker was killed by Afghan forces.
Mr Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His remains should be flown to the Dover Air Force Base in the state of Delaware on Monday evening.
He previously carried out two missions in Iraq, and this mission in Afghanistan was also the second for him.
