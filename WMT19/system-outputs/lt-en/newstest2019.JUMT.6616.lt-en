It is proposed that cats and dogs be labeled with microchips
Bustas Environmental Protection Committee Chairman Kustatis Maevica, along with other members of the border, registered an amendment in Animal Welfare and Conservation Act , which propose to mark cats and dogs with subcutaneous microorganisms.
" We recommend that cats and dogs should be labeled under the skin under microchips , and their registration and labeling should be conducted by the local authorities , the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Services.
2019 in , all dogs are free from public funds : will be free label , and in 2020 in , free cats : free will , so will the public will not be worried and costs covered by specially planned state funding , " the Kimas Chairman of the Environment Committee Kustastis Maverica said.
The purpose of amending the law is to address the systematic requirement for labeling domestic animals.
It is expected to prevent problems caused by non - responsible breeders , illegal breeders or sellers.
It is estimated that on a provisional basis , the average cost of the chip and services , which amount to € 5 will be around , will be compensated during the transitional period by all pet owners.
The total cost of marking all pets can reach 6 million. Euro 
The demand for these funds is expected to spread in three years and it will be an annual amount of 2 million. Euro 
It is estimated that funding for labeling programs will be broadcast through the Environment Environment Support Special Program , whose income this year will increase significantly as a result of increase in natural resource taxes and redistribution of funds.
These funds will be used not only for the labeling of cats and dogs by the municipalities , but also for the castration and other programs.
Of According to Maveika , the common practice of mandatory labeling in almost all countries of the European Union , which allows the animals to protect themselves ( as they owners can be easily returned ), and saves himself time cattle producers It is , when looking for a shelter and a misguided pet requires a lot of time and money.
In addition , the law of the European Union says that pets are allowed to travel only.
At the same time , labeling forces the animal to take care of the responsibility of your life.
The first compulsory labeling suggestions were opposed because the related programs were proposed to be funded by the population.
" The current model should avoid this criticism , because animal protection environmental support program is proposed to be funded from income increased and not only veterinarians , but also public figures , have the right to label people or animal care institutions , Who has heard special courses in veterinary medicine , " the author of the project.
Draft legislation was registered by a group of Seamus members representing various groups of Semas - Kustastis Maverieka , Algimantas dambrava , Eugenijas Jentvilas , Edinus Puppins , Rimas Andricus , Antenna Winkas and others.

- If not , then the concerned technicians should be held liable.
The law is very clear , they did not claim that the aircraft was allowed to reopen.
In order to stop airplane accidents in Indonesia, these bad technicians need the law.

प्रेसीडेंसी: जनमत संग्रह के लिए कोई कृत्रिम सुविधा नहीं
सेमास ने संविधान के पहले खंड में जनमत संग्रह कार्टेल को कम करने के लिए सत्तारूढ़ के प्रस्ताव को मंजूरी दे दी है, जिसमें उच्च स्तर की सुरक्षा है, राष्ट्रपति संशोधनों का प्रस्ताव करेंगे, उनके सलाहकार मिंडुगास लिंग कहते हैं।
“आधी से अधिक आबादी ने संविधान के लिए मतदान किया - यह एक आवश्यकता है।
यह और इसका परिवर्तन, विशेष रूप से इसके पहले खंड के लेख, निश्चित रूप से बहुमत से कम नहीं होने चाहिए।
यह भविष्यवाणी करना आसान है कि राष्ट्रपति वास्तव में वीटो कर रहे हैं, "दलिया ग्रैबाउस्सिटो के आंतरिक राजनीति के सलाहकार ने मंगलवार को बताया।
उन्होंने जोर दिया कि संविधान का पहला अध्याय राज्य के मूल विषयों - भाषा, ध्वज, क्षेत्र, राजधानी, राज्य की संप्रभुता को परिभाषित करता है, इसलिए, एम। लिंगे के अनुसार, इन लेखों को बदलने के लिए आवश्यक वोटों की संख्या को कम करके, एक "नकारात्मक मिसाल" और "अनियंत्रित जोखिम" बनाया जाएगा।
"राष्ट्रपति के अनुसार, किसी कृत्रिम राहत की आवश्यकता नहीं है, जनमत संग्रह के लिए अधिक तैयारी, लोगों के साथ अधिक संवाद," उन्होंने आश्वासन दिया।
मंगलवार को, सेमास ने कानून को जनमत संग्रह में संशोधन के गोद लेने पर मतदान करने की योजना बनाई है।
यह प्रदान करता है कि उच्च स्तर के संरक्षण के साथ संविधान के पहले और चौदहवें वर्गों में संशोधन को अपनाया जाएगा यदि मतदाताओं के कम से कम दो-पांचवें हिस्से को एक जनमत संग्रह में मतदान करने का अधिकार है।
वर्तमान में, मतदान के अधिकार वाले सभी नागरिकों के आधे से अधिक संविधान के पहले और चौदहवें वर्गों के लेखों को जनमत संग्रह द्वारा प्रतिस्थापित किया जा सकता है।
लिथुआनिया में चुनाव अधिकार लगभग 2.5 मिलियन हैं। नागरिक: आधा 1.25 मिलियन होगा मतदाता, दो-पांचवां - एक लाख मतदाता।
यह प्रस्ताव सितंबर में संसद में पूर्व के संशोधनों पर राष्ट्रपति पद के वीटो के बाद अपनाया गया था, जिसने संविधान की धारा 1 के अनुच्छेद 12 को बदलकर वोटों की संख्या की आवश्यकताओं को कम कर दिया था, जो नागरिकता को परिभाषित करता है।
यह दोहरी नागरिकता पर जनमत संग्रह की तैयारी में एक जनमत संग्रह को कम करने का प्रस्ताव है, जो अगले साल 12 मई और 26 मई को होना चाहिए, जब राष्ट्रपति चुनावों के पहले और दूसरे दौर की योजना बनाई जाए।
11 मार्च, 1990 को स्वतंत्रता की बहाली के बाद से, कुछ अपवादों के अलावा, प्रवासियों के पास दोहरी नागरिकता नहीं हो सकती है।
लिथुआनियाई समुदाय द्वारा दोहरी लिथुआनियाई नागरिकता की मांग की जाती है, लेकिन डर है कि वर्तमान परिस्थितियों में एक जनमत संग्रह नहीं होगा - पर्याप्त संख्या में लोग वोट नहीं करेंगे।
आर। मासिउलिस: लिथुआनियाई हवाई अड्डे "गंदे", इसलिए उन्हें अपग्रेड किए जाने की आवश्यकता है
परिवहन और संचार मंत्री रोकास मूस्युलिस कहते हैं, लिथुआनियाई हवाई अड्डे और सड़क की बुनियादी संरचना बढ़ने लगी है, इसलिए इसे नए सिरे से बनाने की आवश्यकता है।
उनके अनुसार, विलनियस हवाई अड्डे का नवीनीकरण एक न्यूनतम कार्य है जिसे राज्य को करना चाहिए।
"एयर ट्रांसपोर्ट इन्फ्रास्ट्रक्चर पहले से ही प्रिय है क्योंकि इसे छोटे यात्री प्रवाह के लिए डिज़ाइन किया गया था।
हमें विलनियस हवाई अड्डे को नवीनीकृत करना चाहिए - यह दीर्घकालिक योजना में भी नहीं जाता है, यह न्यूनतम है जो हमें करना चाहिए ", मासीउलिस ने लोकतंत्र विकास कोष और राज्य पत्रिका द्वारा आयोजित एक संचार सम्मेलन में कहा।
मंत्री के अनुसार, अगला दशक बहुत महत्वपूर्ण होगा, क्योंकि महत्वपूर्ण परियोजनाओं को लागू करना होगा - वाया बाल्टिका, रेल बाल्टिका, कालीपेडा का बाहरी बंदरगाह बनाया जाएगा, विलनियस और कानास हवाई अड्डों का नवीनीकरण किया जाएगा, और शायद एक नया हवाई अड्डा बनाया जाएगा।
"अगला दशक बहुत महत्वपूर्ण होगा - हमें सड़कों, रेलवे, कालीपद में एक बाहरी बंदरगाह के निर्माण को पूरा करने की आवश्यकता है, हवाई अड्डों की व्यवस्था करने के लिए, शायद एक नए हवाई अड्डे के निर्माण पर निर्णय लेने के लिए।
हमें नींद नहीं आनी चाहिए, पहले से ही 10, 20 या 30 साल के बाद हमारी संभावनाओं का फायदा उठाने वाली परियोजनाएँ शुरू हो जाएँगी, ”परिवहन और संचार मंत्री ने कहा।
श्री मैसीलीस ने दोहराया कि हाल के वर्षों में कार के रखरखाव के लिए बहुत कम धनराशि मिली है।
"अभी सड़क की स्थिति में सुधार नहीं हो रहा है, क्योंकि धन पर्याप्त आवंटित नहीं किया गया है।
हम नई सड़कों का निर्माण करने में सक्षम हैं, लेकिन यहां तक ​​कि सबसे आवश्यक रखरखाव, राजमार्गों पर, धन की कमी है।
अगर हम उनकी हालत सुधारना चाहते हैं तो हमें सड़क रखरखाव पर खर्च होने वाली राशि का निर्धारण करना चाहिए।
उन्होंने जोर देकर कहा कि इस साल लिथुआनियाई परिवहन क्षेत्र में सेवाओं का निर्यात 18.6% बढ़ा है, और जर्मनी, सबसे बड़ा निर्यात बाजार, रूस से बेहतर प्रदर्शन करता है।
श्री मासीउलिस ने एक बार फिर यूरोपीय आयोग के प्रस्ताव की आलोचना की कि यूरोपीय संघ के वाहक को समय-समय पर पंजीकरण के लिए ट्रेनों को वापस करना होगा।
“हमें पश्चिमी यूरोप में अपने निर्यातकों को घर पर महसूस कराने के लिए प्रयास करना चाहिए।
In my opinion , suggest returning home with tow trucks is absurd , because the burning empty fuel trucks in Europe and increase emissions.
