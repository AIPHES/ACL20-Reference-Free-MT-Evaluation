MG Baltic case: Gustainis' new lawyer says he has not yet been able to access the material of the case
The eleventh MG Baltic hearing on Monday brought together all the defendants: Šarūnas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The trial began with testimony from the defendants.
At the last hearing, Alexander Doroshev, the state-appointed new attorney for Gustaini, told the panel of judges that he had not yet been able to access the material of the case.
At the time, Linas Belevičius, an attorney at MG Baltic, stated that in order to ensure full protection of the individual, the panel of judges had to allow the new lawyer access to the material of the case and requested that the hearing be postponed.
'To ensure a person's defense, he needs to get to know the material of the criminal case.
It's not just a formal sit-down,” Belevich said.
The new lawyer, Doroshev, noted that he had not been able to access either the indictment or all the material in the case.
At a previous hearing, the suspect, Gustainis, announced he was abandoning his lawyer because he could no longer pay him.
Audio recordings were also heard at the meeting.
Lawyers for the defendants were outraged that audio recordings submitted to the court were of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that politicians, taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated decisions in favour of the group in the Seimas and other state institutions, as well as had an impact on determining the winners of public procurement, recalls ELTA.
More than 150 people were interviewed during the pre-trial investigation, more than 50 of whom were members of the last and this parliamentary term, several former ministers and members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 surveys and more than 30 searches were conducted.
It is suspected that Š. Gustainis received a bribe of more than 8 thousand euros, G. Steponavičius – 15 thousand euros, V. Gapšys – more than 27 thousand E. Masiulis is suspected of taking a bribe of more than 106 thousand euros.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trade in influence, the Liberal Movement of bribery, trade in influence and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of bribery and trade in influence.
It is alleged that politicians consulted with R. Kurlianskis, the vice president of MG Baltic Group, on bribes, and later proposed or supported initiatives in favour of the group in the Seimas or other institutions.
Ethics watchdogs: The Board of the Liberal Movement is right about the actions of the Vilnius Division
“The decisions taken by the Board are in accordance with the statutes,” said its head Vytautas Tamošiūnas after the meeting of the commission.
'Our decision wasn't something new.
We had already made an explanation as a commission in July, when there was a question about Pagegiai and Utena.
Then we said that, according to the statutes, this is a matter of competence for the board.
And if the board decides that some division can do what it wants - go with the committee and the board agrees with that, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has adopted, then there is a decision that all chapters form party lists.
And if you don't agree with the board then there is an opportunity to suspend membership and go with the committee,” he added.
According to Tamošiūnas, the party's board will now decide on the next steps.
On October 17, the Board of the Liberal Movement of the Party overturned the decision of the Vilnius City Division to participate in municipal elections not with the list of the party, but with the new electoral committee.
According to the party's board, the capital's Liberal decision to participate in elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's statutes and board decisions.
By October 31, the Vilnius department had to cancel its attempts to participate in municipal elections with a committee list.
But the department did not.
Ausrine Armonaite, a former head of the department, has already withdrawn from the Liberal Movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, former Chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus Šimašius, promising to seek another term as head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the Public Election Committee “For Vilnius, which we are proud of!”.
He also left the party.
Elections for municipal councils and mayors will take place in March next year.
Residents of a village in northern India drove a tiger on a tractor that had previously torn apart one man, officials said Monday.
Mahaviras Kaujlagi, a forest maintenance officer, said that when the tiger torn down a man who worked in the fields late Sunday, villagers surrounded the beast and drove it with a tractor as the pair tried to escape.
Residents say this tiger also attacked and tortured one young man about 10 days ago.
The village in question is located in the Dudhva Tiger Reserve in Lakhympur Kher district, about 250 km southeast of Laknau, the capital of Uttar Pradesh state.
It is forbidden to use tigers in protected areas.
Ramesh Pandey, director of the reserve, said the case would be reported to police under the Wildlife Conservation Act.
In April, villagers smashed another tiger in the Nighasan district of Uttar Pradesh, which suffered serious injuries.
Tiger is India's national animal; under the Wildlife Conservation Act, tigers are considered an endangered species.
Last year's government figures show at least one person died every day in clashes with wild tigers or elephants over the previous three years.
There has been a gradual increase in human conflicts with tigers since the 1970 s, when India launched a Tiger Protection Program, which established reserves in national parks and started criminalising the power of big cats.
Although the methods of calculating tigers have changed, the census would show that the then population of about 1,800 tigers rose to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
It is proposed that cats and dogs must be labelled with microchips
Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Committee on the Environment of the Seimas, together with other members of the Seimas, has registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act proposing mandatory labelling of cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips.
'We propose that cats and dogs should be labelled with subcutaneous microchips, and their registration and labelling should be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
All dogs will be labelled free of charge in 2019 and cats in 2020, so residents will not be worried and the costs will be covered by specially planned state funding,” said Kęstutis Mažeika, chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.
The amendments to the law seek to address the systemic need for pet labelling.
It is hoped that this will help to avoid the problems caused by irresponsible animal growers, illegal multipliers or sellers.
It is estimated that, according to the expected average cost of providing a microchip and service of around €5, all animal owners will be compensated during the transition period.
The total cost of labelling all pets can be up to €6 million.
The need for these funds is expected to spread over three years, reaching €2 million annually.
The labelling programmes are expected to receive funding through the Municipal Environment Support Specific Programme, whose revenues will increase significantly this year due to increased taxes on natural resources and the redistribution of funds.
Municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for the labelling of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programs.
According to K. Mažeika, the practice of compulsory labelling is common in almost all countries of the European Union, which allows the protection of the animals themselves (because the lost can easily be returned to the owners), and saves the time of the animal growers themselves when they have to spend a lot of time and money searching for an escaped and lost pet.
In addition, EU legislation stipulates that travel is only possible with marked pets.
At the same time, labelling obliges responsible care for the animal throughout its life.
Previous proposals for mandatory labelling have met with resistance, as the relevant programmes have been proposed to fund the population.
“The current model should avoid this criticism, as animal protection is proposed to be financed by increased revenues in the environmental support programme and the right to be labelled not only by veterinarians but also by the public, that is, by individuals from animal care institutions who have listened to special courses at the Veterinary Academy,” the authors of the project say.
The bill was registered by a group of Members representing different parliamentary groups - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 members of government forces killed in Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
Arif Noori, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that four other soldiers were wounded in the attack on a joint army and police checkpoint in the Kogyani district.
According to Noori, six militants were killed and ten other Taliban were wounded during a three-hour battle with Afghan forces.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement to the media in which the movement takes responsibility for Monday's attack in Gaza province.
Mr Noori said the post was installed two days ago in a strategically important area to cut off the Taliban supply route.
The post was completely destroyed in the attack.
'Morning' stretches out helping hand for Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the fourth round of the FIBA European Cup will be held at Vilnius Rytas Arena, where clubs from Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
The duel will be held in the capital for political reasons.
Vilnius “Rytas”, which has a warm relationship with Ukrainian basketball, will host Cherkaski Mavpy and Pristina “KB Prishtina” teams under its roof in “Rytas” Arena on November 7.
'For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine we couldn't hold this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to accept us,' Ukrainian head coach Maxim Michelson thanked Morning.
- We have many friends in Vilnius, and our countries always agree well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the best countries with basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honour for us to play here.
We hope that we will receive support from the residents of Vilnius.
The Kosovo team could not come to Ukraine because these countries do not have any diplomatic relations.
The Ukrainian team currently ranks third after the first round with one win in three meetings, while the Kosovo team is in second position and has more to win.
This will be crucial for Group E, as only two teams will qualify for the next round.
In the past, the matches between Ukraine and Kosovo teams in qualifying for the 2017 European Basketball Championship have also taken place in Vilnius.
Then the Ukrainian team celebrated the 100:61 victory.
Basketball fans will be able to enter the match for free on Wednesday and the start of the duel is 19.
'Women lie better' star actress Arsobaite is haunted by liars
It's probably just a coincidence, but the glamorous brown actress Brigita Arsobaite has been getting roles related to liars for the last time.
Initially, the series “Women Lies Better,” then the play “The Lies” and finally the comedy “The Lies.”
In this film, Brigita plays the beautiful wife of Dainius Kazlauskas' hero.
'I loved filming “Melagie” because I'm more of a theatre actress and I rarely appear in cinema.
A brilliant team of colleagues from the start promised an excellent result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the pitch was the puppy Sunny!
I thought all my life that if I had a dog, it would be really big and serious.
I've never been fascinated by those small, decorative “Fifty” quarterbacks.
But during filming, Sunny was so attached to me that sympathy became mutual and eventually I even wanted to buy it from the host, but unsuccessfully,” the actress smiles.
From the first minute a new Lithuanian comedy “Melagiai”, produced by Lithuanian film hits “Inexperienced” and “Between Us, Boys...” producer Paulius Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionov, enters comical and intriguing periods of family members.
Your beloved has just announced she is expecting.
It would be great news, just... your beloved is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
After failing to announce all the “good news,” parents suddenly declare - they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this is happening just before the most beautiful holidays of the year - Christmas!
But the end will be even more surprising, because no one expected such atoms.
All the heroes are not what they looked like at first glance...
In addition to B. Arsobaitė's comedy “Melagiai” four-time film stars will present a good mood to the audience: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Liubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
The comedy “Liars” has been in cinemas since November 9.
Decide whether to write off €100 million in unpaid taxes by emigrants
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted an amendment to the Residence Declaration Act drafted by Ramūnas Karbauskis, the leader of “peasants.”
56 members voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstentions.
Parliament will then proceed to review the amendments on 6 December or later, following the Government's conclusion.
According to Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarian, within three years one person does not pay about 1 thousand euros, and now there are about 100 thousand such persons.
Algirdas Sysas, a Social Democrat, lamented that in this way Parliament would “urge some people not to abide by their obligations” by declaring their departure and then no taxes would be counted.
Conservative Antanas Matulas, a member of the Committee on Health Affairs, noted that Lithuanians living abroad use the fact that when they pay a small health insurance tax, they come to Lithuania for treatment, providing them with the same services as those who pay the tax.
The amendments foresee that those who will pay social security contributions in the countries of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation would be considered to have left Lithuania, while Sodra will have exempted them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevičius, the head of Sodra, has previously said that such a move will make life easier for both the people who emigrated and the activities of Sodra.
Video circulating online of a sliding bear reveals a serious problem
Filmed as the mother bear climbs a steep snowy slope and the puppy climbs, slips down and pushes again.
The video has received numerous reviews and comments.
People admired the tenacity of the little bear - repeatedly slipping down, he climbed back to his mother.
He is not successful at first, but the puppy is not trying to give up and finally reaches his goal.
The video did belong to the attention, but it also reveals the threat posed by humans to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people's desire to know wildlife can sometimes be harmful.
'It's obvious to me that the bear drone was very frightening.
Their movements show that they are panicking.
If the drone didn't fly around, they would likely have chosen a safer path or overcome it more slowly or cautiously.
It's a great example of how drones shouldn't be used,” ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago, Ditmer and his colleagues investigated how drones affect bears.
The animals were fitted with heart work meters.
When the drone approached, some bears went to run, others didn't run anywhere, but all their hearts started beating more often from scare.
Scientists advise the use of drones to film animals responsibly, not to fly too close, not to make noise and not to fly where it is forbidden.
The fleeing president was approached by a newspaper
A Kiev court on Tuesday summoned ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, who had left for Russia, to attend a hearing on his alleged state treason in an unusual manner - a summons published in the state's official Journal.
In a court call published in the government news newspaper Uriadovoj kurjer, the former leader is invited to attend a criminal trial hearing on November 19, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that Yanukovych has the right to attend the meeting via video link.
On October 30, a Kiev court announced that it had closed the debate in Yanukovych's case.
Yanukovych's lawyer, Alexander Goroshinsky, who works in Russia, was given the opportunity to register with a register of foreign lawyers by November 19 so that he could attend a meeting where Yanukovych is expected to speak his last word via video link.
Kremlin-backed Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the president's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader had been taken to Russia during a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, and a little later a war broke out in the east of the country between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists.
Since then, the fighting has claimed about 10 thousand lives, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a lasting ceasefire.
Valdas Benkunskas will lead the list of conservatives to Vilnius City Council
The Conservative candidate for the year was previously confirmed by former economy minister, MP Dainius Kreivys.
Over the weekend, during the Conservative primary election, party members ranked the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Municipal Council.
According to the party, V. Benkunskas, Chairman of the Vilnius Division Conference of the TS-LKD, became the leader of the Conservative List.
The first ten candidates were members of Vilnius City Municipal Council Paule Kuzmickienė, Adam Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Baškienė, former member of the Seimas Liutauras Kazlavikas, Chairman of the Young Conservatives League Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karazijaitė.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on 3 March next year.
Constitutional Court complains about restrictions on cogeneration power plants
The opposition, as promised, has appealed to the Constitutional Court (CT) against the decision of those in power to pass a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incinerators.
On Tuesday, the opposition group of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that a group of members of the Seimas had appealed to others to investigate compliance with the Constitution with amendments to the Waste Management Act passed by the governors.
“MPs stress that the provisions of the law seek to question existing waste incinerators projects, instructing the government to impose new restrictions (20 km from the residential area) before the law enters into force on waste incinerators started in Vilnius and Kaunas,” the report reads.
“MPs note that, given the way in which the law formulates a ban on the construction of waste-management state-owned objects (i.e. the distance and definition of the concept of “habitable territory”), it should be concluded that this ban disproportionately restricts or even denies the very essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the burning of waste for energy production, as the criteria are formulated in such a way that, given the density and distribution of Lithuanian residents in the country, it would be practically impossible to build such facilities across the country,” it adds.
The appeal states that the law passed is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
Others have repeatedly pointed out that the legislation does not apply to the legal facts and consequences that occurred prior to the entry into force of the newly adopted legislation.
In this case, the government is given the power to apply the law back on the basis of an undefined criterion.
The introduction of such legal regulation violates constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security, the protection of legitimate expectations, and therefore the constitutional principle of the rule of law,” the appeal states.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in projects of cogeneration power plants in Vilnius and Kaunas.
Halting current projects would not only cause hundreds of millions of financial losses to the state, it would also cause huge losses to the Lithuanian population, increasing heating prices, and increasing waste disposal in landfills would increase environmental pollution.
The appeal was signed by members from the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Movement, Social Democratic groups and the deputy senior member of the ruling Social Democratic Labour Group Algirdas Butkevičius.
A couple of weeks ago, Parliament managed to gather 71 votes to reject amendments to the Waste Management Act passed by President Dalia Grybauskaite's veto, which provides for the government's right to suspend the construction of cogeneration power plants already under way, and established a 20 km “quarantine” zone for the construction of such power plants.
Amendments to the law passed by the Seimas will come into force from 1 January 2019. It is true that those in power are already proposing to scrap the 20 km limit.
This proposal is expected to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, there is no plan to scrap the government's right to suspend projects that have already begun.
Others will deal with the case in a row - no sooner than a year later.
Published Question Statistics by LeBron James at Lakers
The start of Lebron James' career at the Los Angeles Lakers is not what he himself, the organization and basketball fans expected.
The Lakers started the season with four wins and six defeats, and such a weak start helped lead to rumors of a possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
However, such talk was reassured by the president of basketball operations, Magiz Johnson, who said he would not forgive the coach, but he needed to play better.
James, the team's biggest star, should also look at himself.
Although the striker's statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 assists.
But it doesn't tell the whole truth.
Other figures have emerged in the first ten games of the season showing that the Lakers are playing better when James is not on the court.
The striker is not favoured by +/- statistics showing how many points more are scored or missed by the team when certain players are on the pitch.
That's when James is on the pitch, the Lakers have spent 30 points more than their rivals this season.
As he sat on the bench, the Lakes scored 19 points more than the rivals.
The Lakers are currently in just 13 th place in the Western Conference, but a few wins can turn things around at the top foot.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian airspace in 2019 and 2020.
“Lithuania greatly appreciates Spain's cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and region,” Minister Linkevičius said.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out NATO air police and air police reinforcement missions in the Baltic States five times, including three times in Lithuania.
The last time Spanish Eurofighter fighters were deployed in Šiauliai was between May and August this year.
Spain will also contribute to the protection of airspace in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations on security, political, economic and strategic communication in the fight against propaganda are taking place between Lithuania and Spain.
Linkevičius expressed his hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to work closely together on the European, transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga is Spain's fifth representative in Lithuania.
On October 29, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented the distinctive letters to President Dalia Grybauskaite.
V. Ačienė on the arrest of R. Ačas: I believe in the innocence and law enforcement of the man
'It was the most unexpected thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, perhaps the services are doing the job they have to do.
Everyone is doing their job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is right and fair, that no unfair action should be taken against him,” Ačienė said.
Mr Ach was detained by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday, with law enforcement alleging that he took a high-value bribe while still director of the Raseiniai Municipal Administration, and in exchange could create exceptional conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the municipal-owned Raseiniai Bus Park.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly buying Mr Ach or of being involved in concealing bribes in various financial transactions.
In April of this year, the Raseiniai district municipal council dismissed Mr Ačas as head of the administration in a third attempt after a expressed mistrust.
The former “regulator” became a member of the newly established Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminas Kirkilo in March this year and suspended membership of the party on Monday.
Mr Ach was unsuccessfully nominated as a representative of the electoral committee Your Raseiniai in the mayoral election a few years ago.
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to nominate him in the election of the mayor of Raseiniai next year, but had not yet decided whether he would participate in municipal council elections.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas with the list of Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union and is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says she will wait for further law enforcement action - depending on whether she steps down from her job at the commission.
'I don't really make sudden decisions today, I think I'll make a decision this week.
I will see if there is a need, as the accusations have been made, of course I will make one decision or another.
I probably need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again, it will put everything in place,” she said.
The representative of the opposition conservatives in the Seimas Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė called on the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Pranckietis and the head of “peasants” Ramūnas Karbauskis to distance themselves from the statements of the group colleague Vida Ačienė and withdraw her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission by moving to another parliamentary committee or commission.
She argues that further work by Ačienė on the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission would “lead to public mistrust and discredit the work of an important parliamentary oversight commission.”
The sensual music of Coldplay also attracted famous Lithuanian couples
On an autumn Monday evening, many music and film lovers gathered for the pre-premiere of the film Coldplay: a Head Full of Dreams.
A whole group of famous people came to the event: Jonas and Simona Nainiai, Ignas Lelys, Martynas Tyla and many others.
The film tells the story of Coldplay, one of Britain's most popular pop-up groups, which intertwines with moments from concerts.
Documentary director Matthew Whitecross met the band's guys while they were still playing in bars and collecting just a few dozen viewers.
The film can see snapshots from behind-the-scenes concerts, rehearsals or leisure.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met in 1996 at college and founded Pectoralz.
They were soon joined by boxer Guy Berryman and, a little later, drummer Will Champion.
The band changed its name to Coldplay and just twenty years ago released its first record, “Safety,” which included three tracks.
Of the 500 copies of the record, most were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, and only 50 copies of Safety entered the trade.
Coldplay is now a world-renowned, respected and beloved band that has released seven albums with more than 100 million copies sold.
Over two decades, the band has won 107 different awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.
Juventus lead V.Chepukaitis to victory - LKL MVP of the week
Utena's Juventus high-ranked Vaidas Chepukaitis, who played a solid match in Betsafe-LKL, won the title of MVP of the week.
The centre scored a double, which helped the Juventus team beat the Alytus Dzukija players through an extension of 86:77.
In nearly 31 minutes played, Chepukaitis scored 13 points (5/6 points) and 11 rebounds.
In addition, the tall provoked 7 contestants' fouls, took 3 rebounds and made 4 assists.
Such indicators guaranteed 30 efficiency scores.
This season, Chepukaitis scores 17.2 points and this is the best indicator of his career while playing in the 11 th season in the LKL.
Tall is the fourth most valuable player this season.
Along with V.Čepukaitis, Martynas Gecevičius and Ksistof Lavrinovic (both Skycop Prienai), Yannick Franke (Pasvalys “Milk Stars”) and Jerai Grant (Klaipėda “Neptune”) were among the top five of the week.
It was only recently that Legionnaire Franke, who topped Pasvalys' team, scored 24 points, 10 rebounds and provoked fouls from 8 opponents in an 88:93 defeat with Skycop, scoring 31 points.
True, he was prevented from becoming the MVP of the week by the team's defeat.
The defensive link in the top five with the Pasvalys team's Legionnaire consists of his opponent of the day, Gecevich, who represents the Prienai team.
He scored 19 points and scored 9 rebounds.
Such indicators guaranteed the sniper 26 efficiency scores.
Another Skycop player can also be seen on the high-scoring circuit - Lavrinovic had 15 points (3/4, 9/11) in Sunday's game, provoked 7 fouls and scored 23 efficiency points.
Klaipeda Neptune forward J.Grant, who played a powerful match in Vilnius, also entered the top five.
The American scored 25 points (10/11 double) in 25 minutes, 4 rebounds, 3 rebounds and 29 efficiency points.
Such a legionnaire performance allowed the clerks to triumph over the local “Morning” 78:66 in the capital.

Palestinian who attacked Israelis with knife in West Bank
The soldier “prevented this attack because he identified a terrorist who attempted to strike a knife at civilians and an IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) officer,” according to a report released by the Israeli army about the incident near the Kirjat Arba settlement near Hebron.
'The soldier fired fire at the terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to hospital.
Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers did not suffer,” the report adds.
An army spokeswoman told AFP that the attack was attempted by a Palestinian.
Video footage filmed after the incident shows him being lightly injured.
A similar wave of Palestinian attacks began in 2015.
Such attacks have declined in recent years, but there are fears there could be a new wave of them.
On October 22, a Palestinian was shot dead after attacking a group of Jewish soldiers near Hebron with a knife.
Grybauskaite urges China to create more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaite is calling on China to create a more favourable investment environment for investments by European Union (EU) countries and to facilitate foreign imports.
Opening a trade and investment forum at the China import exhibition in Shanghai, Grybauskaite stressed that, seeing signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to “unite efforts to stop the spread of protectionism in the world,” targeting the root causes of the tensions caused by trade wars, “excess output and unfair competition.”
'The European Union attaches great importance to China's commitment to creating a more attractive, open environment for investment, which is important when negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign businesses feel welcome and secure here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property,” Grybauskaite said.
According to her, China's opening is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The Lithuanian leader stressed that the transparency of investments must be “above the interests of any business group.”
“Transparency, the rule of law, strict compliance with international treaties - this must be essential for the environment of new investment relations,” Grybauskaite stressed.
“Corrupt capital flows should not be welcome in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries,” she added.
China's import exhibition is trying to defuse criticism that it avoids opening its market and protests only its companies.
The exhibition brings together several heads of state, more than 2,800 companies from 130 countries and regions around the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian statistics department, China currently ranks 25 th among its export partners.
Last year, Lithuania's exports to China grew by 50%, amounting to 180 million euros.
At the same time, imports from China exceeded €820 million.
Some officials worry that China's investment in Lithuania could bring unwanted political influence, while Beijing's exclusive focus on Eastern Europe divides EU unity.
Inconvenience solved: mobile signature service is already in operation
Mobile signature provider Estonian it company SK ID Solutions reports that the mobile signature system failure has been removed and the service is operating as normal.
The mobile signature reopened at 14.28 am.
The mobile signature system broke down at 9.52 am on Monday.
These failures were experienced by customers of telecommunications companies Bee, Tele2 and Telia.

Lion Air plane crash revealed: relatives of dead are angry
Data from the black box of a crashed Indonesian airline, Lion Air, shows that at least four of its last flights have experienced a speed meter work disorder, investigators reported Monday.
Soerjanto Tjahjono, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee (ntsk), said a similar rift occurred during the last four flights of the plane, including the fatal one when the liner fell in the Java Sea on October 29 shortly after takeoff from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board were killed in the crash.
Many media reported trouble during the previous Boeing 737 Max 8 flight from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
“When we opened the black box - yes, the real technical problem was speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane,” Tjahjono said at a press conference.
“Black box data showed that during two flights before the voyage, Denpasar-Jakarta was also the same problem,” he added.
'There's a lot of rumours circulating on social media.
We now want to explain that there were four flights in the black box (the data remained) during which there were problems with the speed meter in the air,” the head of the ntsk said.
During a meeting with members of the families of those killed, Mr Tjahjono said information from the device recording flight data was in line with reports that its speed and height had changed disorderly as the plane took off on its last flight.
Search teams have not yet found a second black box recording conversations in the pilot's cockpit.
Lion Air said it had been repaired following a technical fault on a flight from Bali to Jakarta, according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
Rusdi Kirana, one of the company's founders, was not invited to speak to Transport Minister Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated a meeting of family members with officials overseeing the search for the remains of the plane and victims and the investigation into the crash.
But he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Mr Kirana, who co-founded Lion Air with his brother Kusnan in 1999, introduce himself.
“Lion Air behaved inappropriately,” said one man, who presented himself as the father of Shandy Johan Ramadhan, a passenger who worked as a prosecutor on the island where the plane was flying.
'I want Mr Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention,' he stressed.
- Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air didn't show us any sympathy. '
After that meeting, Mr Kirana hastily left, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are awaiting the results of a lengthy process of identifying the dead.
Nearly 140 corpses loaded with human remains have been handed over to police medical experts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives questioned why the liner, which was launched two months ago, was allowed to fly, although a crash occurred during the October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, among other things, causing passengers to be frightened by the sudden fall of the plane down shortly after takeoff.
Lion Air said the crash had been cleared.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? "asked the son of one of the dead.
- If not, the relevant technicians must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, not they said the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must respond according to the law so that plane crashes in Indonesia do not happen again.
Mr Tjahjono said the large amount of fine debris and the fact that debris had spread in a relatively small area suggest that the liner was likely heading into the water at very high speeds.
'The plane was seamless when it fell into the sea.
It didn't explode in the air and the plane's engines were operating in large twists when it touched the water - as all the broken turbine blades show,” the official explained.
The crash of a Lion Air liner is the worst aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people were killed when a Garuda plane crashed near Medan.
Rescuers were called from the rubble after the crash: a minor was also hit
On Monday evening, cars BMW and Mercedes-Benz collided at the Bridges.
The cars collided with a cache and three people were reported injured.
The BMW driver, who was born in 1999, reportedly drove to the opposite side of the road and crashed into a Mercedes-Benz car with his dad, born in 1967, and his daughter, born in 2005.
A BMW driver was rescued from the rubble by firefighters - rescuers.
A girl from Mercedes-Benz was knocked out of her teeth in the crash.
All of the victims were taken to hospital.
President: There is no need for any artificial relief on the referendum
With the approval of a proposal by those in power to reduce the referendum bar for the first section of the Constitution, which currently has more protection, the president will veto the amendments, says her adviser, Mindaugas Linge.
'More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that's the requirement.
This and its amendment, especially the articles in its first section, should certainly be no less than a majority.
It's easy to predict that the president would really veto,” Dalia Grybauskaite's domestic policy adviser said Tuesday.
He emphasized that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamental subjects of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty - so reducing the number of votes required to change these articles would create a “negative precedent” and “open up unmanageable risks.”
“In the president's view, we don't need any artificial relief, we need more preparation for the referendum itself, we need more dialogue with the people,” he said.
Parliament plans to vote on the amendment to the Referendum Act on Tuesday.
It provides that the decision on amendments to Section One and Fourteenth of the Constitution with higher protection is taken if at least two-fifths of citizens with electoral rights support it during the referendum.
Currently, more than half of all citizens with voting rights can change the articles of section one and fourteenth of the Constitution by referendum.
Some 2.5 million citizens have electoral rights in Lithuania: half would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths would be one million voters.
The proposal came after Parliament approved a presidential veto in September on amendments previously passed in parliament that eased demands for the number of votes to amend Article 12 of the Constitution's First Section, which defines citizenship.
The bar for the referendum is proposed to be cut in the run-up to the referendum on dual citizenship, due to take place on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential election are planned.
Those who emigrated after independence on 11 March 1990 cannot currently have dual citizenship, with some exceptions.
Dual citizenship is sought by the world's Lithuanian community, but fears that under the current conditions a referendum would not take place - a sufficient number of people would not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports are “brash”, so they need to be updated
Lithuania's airport and road infrastructure is starting to crumble, so it needs to be upgraded, says Transport Minister Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renovation of Vilnius Airport is the minimum task that the state must perform.
'Air transport infrastructure is already bracing because it's been planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must refurbish Vilnius airport - it is not even part of long-term planning, it is a minimum of what we must do,” Mr. Masiulis said at a conference on Tuesday organized by the Foundation for Democracy Development and the journal State.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be crucial because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the construction of Klaipėda external port, the renovation of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and possibly the construction of a new airport.
'The next decade will be very important - we have to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of an external port in Klaipėda, clean up airports, perhaps decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, we must start projects now that will fulfil our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years' time,” the transport minister said.
Mr Masiulis reiterated that there has been too little funding for road maintenance in recent years.
'The state of the roads is not improving yet because there is not enough funding.
We are able to build new roads, but even for essential maintenance, such as on highways, there is a lack of funds.
We must determine the amount to be allocated to road maintenance if we want their condition to improve,” Mr Masiulis said.
He pointed out that Lithuanian transport sector services exports grew by 18.6% this year, while Germany became the largest export market, ahead of Russia.
Mr Masiulis has once again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU carriers must periodically return tractors to the country of registration.
'We need to make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposal for tractors to return home permanently is absurd, because empty trucks would drive in Europe, burn fuel, and increase emissions.
Most of this will be won by the railways, because the costs will rise so much that some of the transport will go to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions,” Mr. Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the transport sector accounts for 12.2%.
Gross domestic product (GDP) of Lithuania.
It employs more than 118,000 people and operates more than 7,500 companies.
Dispute with heirs
Last week, Mr. Masiulis announced in the Committee on Economic Affairs that he had begun negotiations on changing the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building, which would allow the old terminal to be demolished and a new one to be built.
However, Algimantas Degutis, interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD), called Mr. Masiulis's deliberations a political pressure.
According to him, the building, built in the sixties of the last century, is a value listed on the register in 1993, and it is not for politicians, but for specialists to decide on its removal.
Mr. Masiulis commented at the time that a modern entry terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
“To pull that old terminal out of the heritage would be a politically important step to be able to demolish it and build a new modern entry terminal so that when you come to Vilnius you feel in a modern country, not in such an interesting, truly unrepresentative way of our country as innovative,” Mr. Masiulis said last week.
Mr. Masiulis also announced at the time that a completely new passenger terminal was planned to be built in Kaunas and the airport was connected to the Rail Baltica track, building an underground station.
This transport hub is expected to operate in 2026 after the completion of Rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year 4.8 million passengers are expected and next year 5 million.
Kaunas Airport handled a total of 1.2 million passengers last year.
What are Lithuanian troops doing in Afghanistan?
BNS presents the tasks they carry out.
In total, nearly 50 Lithuanian troops serve in Afghanistan.
Kabul.
The headquarters of Kabul International Airport, located in the Afghan capital, serves soldiers of the logistical element of the industry, serving all Lithuanians stationed in the country, organizing visits and military rotations.
Two Lithuanian Special Operations Forces personnel also serve in this Headquarters, ensuring interaction between NATO mission command and combat support with “speculations” in Kandahar.
Military policemen overseeing the public order serve as the commander of NATO's “Resolute Support” mission.
Officers of the Lithuanian Headquarters serve in the same command.
They are responsible for intelligence, operations, planning and logistics.
Kandahar.
About 30 Lithuanian Special Operations Forces troops serve in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.
They train a local police special operations unit, where about 150 Afghans serve.
Officers are trained by SOP soldiers at or outside their own training places.
The “kites” are also assisted by an Air Force soldier who manages drones.
Herat.
Staff officers serve at this headquarters in the northwestern city of Afghanistan.
They work on boards responsible for military training, logistics, intelligence, operations and planning.
Next year, Vilnius will begin direct flights to Madagascar
In the spring of next year, Boeing 767, the largest regular-flight passenger plane, will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly travellers from Lithuania directly to the island of Bė, which belongs to Madagascar, according to information from tour operator Itaka Lietuva, according to the portal madeinvilnius.lt.
It is announced that Blue Panorama airlines will be able to choose between 259 economic class and 8 business class seats.
The new holiday direction will be available directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominic Milowski, CEO of Itaka Lietuva, says he is trying to offer tourists from Lithuania new holiday destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
Other tour operators have also prepared new holiday destinations for the 2019 summer season.
For example, Novaturas and Itaka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Finance Minister on possible crisis: It is important not to talk about disease
'We've always got to prepare for more difficult times.
What I want to welcome is that for the third year in a row we are accumulating reserves for the first time in Lithuania's history.
But also a very important thing is not to talk about the disease,” Shapoka said during a visit to Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday Finance Minister and Deputy Minister Migle Tuskienė is attending meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting addresses issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed that an agreement be reached on how income earned for the provision of certain digital services in EU Member States should be taxed until there is agreement at global level.
The Eurogroup will review draft euro area budgets submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected Italy's draft budget as failing to meet the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC has taken this opportunity.
More information was requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss deepening Economic and Monetary Union: options for implementing the European Deposit Insurance Scheme and reforms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports the stronger role of the ESM in financial assistance programmes, but it is considered that the functions of the ESM must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of functions between the ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Burach.
Lithuanian traditions and customs
Recently it was 120 years since the birth of famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicler, ethnographer and ethnographer Balys Buračas (1897-1972) in Sidariai, Šiaulėnai, then Siauliai Governorate.
Commemorating the 100 th anniversary of the Lithuanian state, we have a great opportunity to remember how the life-filled national revival has called many Lithuanian people, including the brothers Buračus - Bali, Jonas, Bronys - from the very depths of the village, to become involved in the fostering, normalization and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Buračas has travelled through his home country with a camera in his hands in more than 50 years, providing a wide and realistic picture of our country's customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly endangered deposits of national culture and had a rare ability to grasp the survival value of his work.
In the photographs of Balys Buračas, Lithuanian landscapes, mounds, and in the environment of everyday life and holidays, our people decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication contains a significant part of Bali Burach's legacy dedicated to describing national working customs and related traditions and, above all, their fascinating iconography.
The material published shows not only the specificity and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and heavy occupation.
The book's manuscript is full of works by interwar Samogitians, especially cupcakes, northerners, telschiskes, as well as the inhabitants of Aukštaitija and Dzukija, their holidays and other traditions and customs written by Balys Buračas.
Of the approximately 10,000 negatives preserved in museums and archives, more than 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photographs were selected for this publication, which are grouped according to selected texts.
They reflect unique aspects of ethnic culture, characteristic of cupcakes, dzuks, and other regions of Aukštaitija and Samogitia.

Tragic fate of the couple: He died after just hours of marriage
A young couple who were married just hours earlier died in a helicopter crash in the southwest of the US state of Texas.
William Troy Byler, 24, and his fellow wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler died on Sunday shortly after midnight when a helicopter crashed into a hill 16 km northwest of Juvaldi and 129 km west of San Antonio, local peace judge Steven Kennedy said.
Surprisingly, the accident occurred after falling about 24 kilometres, just as the newlyweds were years old.
The helicopter pilot, 76-year-old Gerald Douglas Lawrence, also died.
The newlyweds studied at Sam Houston State University, based in Hantsville, Texas.
They married on Saturday evening at the Byler family ranch near Juvaldi and flew a family-owned helicopter after a spouse celebration.
The accident occurred when the helicopter flew about 24 kilometres.
The newlyweds flew to Sant Antonio International Airport, where they intended to board a plane and fly for a honeymoon, Kennedy said, without specifying the couple's final destination.
“It's a very rocky, uneven terrain area, and that hill is about 120-150 metres tall,” Kennedy said.
Mr Lawrence has piloted the aircraft of that family for years.
According to Kennedy, he piloted helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After an autopsy, it should be clear what the pilot's physical condition was and whether it could not be the cause of the crash.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after takeoff.
His debris sparked a wide radius on the rocky slope of the hill and the hull remained “dangerously hanging,” flight safety researcher Craig Hatch from the National Transportation Safety Board (ntsb) said at a press conference on Monday.
Investigators intend to remove the debris and then inspect them thoroughly, but it will not be easy for the tractor and truck to reach that location, he said.
The cause of the crash has not yet been determined and a preliminary report from the ntsb is expected to be published in two weeks' time.
Israeli Prime Minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions against Iran a 'historic day'
“Today is a historic day,” Netanyahu told MPs of his Likud party, according to his office.
“Today is the day when under President (Donald) Trump, the US imposes particularly tough sanctions on Iran, the toughest sanctions on Iran ever since efforts to curb its aggression began,” the head of the Israeli government said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would deal a “decisive” blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls the “toughest sanctions of all time,” came after Trump's May and controversial decision to withdraw from the world powers agreement with Tehran over its nuclear program.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which have already fallen by about a million barrels per day since May, and cut Tehran off from international funding.
Israel has long opposed the deal with Iran and says its scope and terms are too limited.
The Jewish state also says the lifting of sanctions has allowed Iran to fund militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighboring Syria and has vowed to prevent it from gaining ground there militarily.
Other participants in the agreement with Iran - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - oppose the US decision and say the agreement, as scheduled, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
Court again dives into the circumstances of young motorcyclist's death
In the case of an accident that ended in the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, North, the court will hear testimony from a witness.
The Vilnius District Court ruled on Tuesday that one of the witnesses in the case would be interviewed at the next hearing on November 26 in order to clarify all the significant circumstances of the case.
A conviction has already been handed down in this case, but the prosecutor's office disagrees with it.
On August 22, Vilnius City District Court acquitted the driver of the car in connection with the fatal motorcycle accident, with 79-year-old Eduard Osipov declaring that the motorcyclist was driving at high speed in the city and committing a serious offence.
The Vilnius district attorney's office is asking the district court to overturn the district court's verdict and says Osipov is the main culprit in the crash and the district court's findings are unfounded.
An attorney for the family of a motorcyclist who died is also asking for the conviction to be overturned.
The crash happened about 15 a.m. on August 11, 2015, when a Scotland Fabia car driven by Osipov drove from Lakunai Street into Žirmūnai Street and collided with a motorcycle on the main road.
The prosecutor's office charged the man that the driver of the car violated road traffic rules intended to give way and caused a traffic accident - killing a man on the main road on the Piaggo motorcycle.
Initial police reports indicated that the scooter driver had died, but later after investigations, the vehicle was found to be equivalent to a motorcycle by force.
Judge Rolandas Bužinskas of Vilnius District Court said that experts found that the motorcycle driver was driving at 89.2 kilometres per hour, although the speed allowed at that location was 50 kilometres per hour.
“The driver of the car could not have predicted that the motorcycle would be travelling at such a high speed,” the judge said.
At the time, the driver of the venerable car claimed he was driving at speeds of just 5-6 kilometres per hour.
The motorcycle driver who saw the barrier tried to stop and fell from the vehicle before colliding with Scotland Fabia.
The prosecutor's office believes Osipov, who was travelling from side to side on the main road, should have given way to the motorcyclist.
Novaja Gazeta: Six Vagner mercenaries killed in Syria
Five Syrian troops and six individuals belonging to the military company Vagner are among those killed.
This is announced by a Novaja Gazeta source in Syria.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5 th Syrian Military Corps was stationed in the area, joined by a number of Syrian volunteers and “military mercenaries.”
Novaja Gazeta has sent an inquest to the Russian Foreign Ministry with a request for information on the fate of the Russians.
Former Belgian king to undergo paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking recognition as the former monarch's child since 2013.
A 50-year-old woman claims her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II, had a short love novel decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies fatherhood.
According to the station's rtbf, he can go to the Supreme Court in opposition to the DNA test.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel - Delphine's mother's ex-husband - is neither biologically nor legally the artist's father.
Delphine has applied for an appropriate investigation to recognise the daughter of “real” father Albert.
The CoR will distribute money to the parties but will give nothing to the socialists
The High Electoral Commission (CEC) plans to allocate a budget grant amounting to nearly €3 million to major political parties this week.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (lsdp), established this spring under the leadership of parliamentary vice-president Gediminas Kirkilo, has not yet been scheduled to allocate funds from the budget.
But they can be addressed in the near future by a separate decision by the CEC if the legal environment governing the distribution of grants to parties changes.
Laura Matjošaityte, chairwoman of the EC, told the VW that “a commission meeting is scheduled for this Thursday to decide on a budget half-annual grant for distribution parties.”
She said a decision on the matter had to be taken by the CoR by 15 November.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, are expected to be allocated €2,751 million.
The opposition Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats are expected to receive more than €0.66 million, the ruling Union of the United States and the Greens about €0.55 million, the opposition Social Democratic Party about €0.5 million, the opposition Liberal Movement nearly €0.4 million, the Labor Party, which does not have its own faction, about €0.23 million, and the recently joined Democratic and Justice Party - nearly €0.22 million, represented in parliament, but neither the ruling party nor the opposition.
Under the current law, which will be followed by the CoR in allocating budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the statutory requirements and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last parliamentary, municipal councils and European Parliament elections.
As a result, the current legal regulation does not allow the lsdp, which was set up this spring, to expect to receive money from the budget.
Because this party has not yet participated in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers receive at least a couple hundred thousand euros in the run-up to three elections next year - the municipality, the president and the European Parliament.
The corresponding amendments to the political parties adopted by the Seimas and this year's budget laws were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaite.
Parliament has not yet decided on this veto, but representatives of the governors, Mr. Kirkilas and Ramūnas Karbauskis, leader of the Peasant-Greens, argue that parliamentarians will seek to reject the president's objections.
However, this will not be possible until this Thursday's meeting of the CoR, so according to Mr. Matjošaitytė, “grants will be distributed according to the legal order that has existed so far.”
It is true that the head of the CoR has not ruled out that if Parliament rejects the president's veto this week or next week and a new amendment on the allocation of budget funds to parties enters into force, the commission may consider appointing additional grants to individual political forces, including the lsdp.
“In making the decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in force, as we are an executive body that has to implement the laws that are passed,” she said.
If Parliament were able to reject the veto and the new laws came into force, it would give extra money to parties by the government, which borrowed the corresponding sums.
Grants already allocated to seven parties would not suffer as a result of such a decision.

Poroshenko: Customers of activist Handziuk murder must be punished
'I want to state that no version - and more than 20 of them today - will be ruled out.
Each will be scrutinised very carefully in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As president, I don't have the opportunity and I don't have to get information that could undermine the course of the investigation.
But the government must ensure transparency, and law enforcement agencies must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to know the truth and punish evil,” Poroshenko said at a meeting with young people Tuesday in Kiev.
He stressed that it was in the best interests of all that Handziuk's murder be cleared and that murderers, crime organizers and customers “take the necessary responsibility.”
“After this case has been transformed into a murder (case), they are quite rightly and justifiably facing a life sentence,” the Ukrainian president said.
He rightly called the public's demand for an open and impartial investigation into the case.
Poroshenko stressed that statements by representatives of law enforcement agencies in parliament should show that “the government is determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice whoever they are.”
He also said that political speculation on the subject would not help clarify the situation, but would further confuse things.
“I urge all forces, both the government and the opposition, not to waste unfounded arguments and, defend God, not to use this assassination for public relations,” the president said.
- Frankly, we now need to unite to ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast - one that raises public confidence.
There's just no other way for us. '
“No one will be allowed to use this situation to destabilise the situation in the country,” he assured me.
Ms Handziuk, who fought against corruption, was attacked and sprayed with acid in the city of Cherson in July.
She was an adviser to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack but died in hospital on Sunday.
After police and prosecutors failed to explain the perpetrators of the attack, Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lucenka issued a resignation statement on Tuesday.
After her death, government officials faced accusations from public activists that they were unable to properly conduct an investigation.
Activists also demanded the resignation of the attorney general and interior minister.
“I am making my resignation statement today,” Lucenka told MPs as he read his investigation report.
Parliament has yet to approve the prosecutor's resignation.
Lucenka accused activists of putting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of Handziuk's murder.
Bill Gates unveils toilet without water
Introducing a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates likened the transition from traditional such facilities to a water-free computer revolution in the 1970 s.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates presented a high-tech toilet at an exhibition in Beijing that doesn't need water in tap pipes, Reuters reported.
The water-free toilet works according to the principle of separating solid and liquid waste.
Both types of sewage are recycled into chemical fertilisers.
“The technology you see here is the greatest achievement in sanitation in the last 200 years,” Bill Gates was quoted by Bloomberg.
The tech toilet was created with the help of a charity foundation set up by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Over seven years, work has been done on a facility that could convert human waste into fertilizer or water, with the fund spending $200 million to do so.
In total, about 20 toilet models were created, according to Bill Gates.
The facility is now complete and can be sold.
But for such toilets to be produced en masse, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500 thousand children under the age of five die each year in the world due to poor sanitation conditions.
Tackling problems caused by poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, increases health spending, which already stands at 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitation situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates to a toilet presentation jar with feces.
He said it was a good reminder that the small sample “may contain 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infectious diseases, and 100 thousand worm parasites eggs.”
Mr Slyva was elected president of the mass football association
On November 5, an extraordinary meeting of the Lithuanian mass football association took place in Kaunas, where Sergey Slyva was elected the new president of the organization.
An extraordinary general meeting of association members was convened as a result of Anatoly Stecenko's request to resign as president of the association.
It was attended by 13 members out of 15.
The main item on the agenda was the election of the new president.
Two candidates - Sergei Slyva and Vaidotas Rastenis - took part in the election.
11 members of the association voted for Slyva, and two members cast their votes for Rastenis.
Mr. Plum will complete a term started by Mr. Stecenko, which will last until January 2021.
Anxiety in France: People's deaths cause concern
French health officials announced Monday that they had permanently banned the widely used pesticide amid concerns about several dozen people recently poisoned in the west of the country.
The health agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all products with pesticides was made after a new safety check launched earlier this year, before at least three waves of poisoning began in September at the Department of Art and Loire.
As a result of these cases, the government had already suspended the use of pesticides.
This soil disinfectant chemical should not contact plants or farm workers.
To be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, around 700 tonnes were used each year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, have complained of eye and throat shaking and respiratory problems in the Angers region, where many salad juices are grown.
“These episodes confirm the fairness of our decision, but they haven't hurried it,” Francoise Weber, deputy director of ANSES, told Ouest France on Monday.
The cast - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and Europe - is considered a “plausible human carcinogen” by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA).
This pesticide, sold under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is permitted in Europe until 2022, when a new safety check is to be carried out.
“There was no choice but to remove him from the market, regardless of whether there were alternatives to him,” Weber told the newspaper.
“We understand the difficulties that salad juice growers, co-farmers, will face, but public health is more important,” she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to halt the use of throwing in a region whose economy relies heavily on intensive agriculture.
More than half of the 35 thousand tons of salad juice consumed annually in Europe are grown in this region near Nantes.
Next season there will be “far fewer salad juices, rolls and pairs,” Philippe Retire, head of the Federation of Nantes Producers, told AFP last month after the government suspended the use of the cast.
EUR 70 million invested in a shopping centre with a review wheel in Tallinn
Next weekend, a new T1 shopping centre opens in the Estonian capital, where the local real estate (real estate) development company Pro Kapital Grupp invested €70 million.
The 130,000 sq m total, or 55,000 sq m rented, area will feature 150 store services or entertainment venues, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, according to the developer's report.
By comparison, the total area of Vilnius “Akropolis” (counting together with the area for offices) is about 110,000 sq. m. and the rent is 91,000 sq. m.
T1 is the first supermarket with a viewing wheel on the roof, according to the developer.
It will be operational early next year.
In addition, international transport gates will also be integrated into the area: tram stops nearby and intercity buses will soon develop.
The main Rail Baltica terminal also runs nearby and is projected to serve 1 million passengers a year around 2026.
Paolo Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says major changes are underway in the global supermarket business and T1 has been at the forefront of their development.
'We've created a next-generation supermarket that provides emotions and experiences that aren't accessible online.
It is a place of attraction for people right in the city centre, a gateway for travellers, an impressive and noteworthy object and, at the same time, a quality time spent with friends or family,” Mr. Michelozzi said in a press release.
Great attention to entertainment
According to the supermarket manager, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery centre in the Baltics.
A total of 12,000 sq m, or a fifth of the total rented area, has been allocated to entertainment at the facility.
The exclusive highlight is the viewing wheel on the roof.
It will lift guests to an altitude of 120 m above sea level - only a TV tower is higher in Tallinn.
Under the review circle, on the fourth floor, there will be a trampoline park, Super Skypark, which will open Europe's largest trampoline centre and Estonia's first basketball and volleyball on trampolines, according to the company.
The interactive SkyLAB Research and Discovery Centre promises to take children for at least 5-6 hours.
The entertainment complex will also feature 360-degree panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the usual cinema shown in six halls, visitors will also be able to get into virtual reality cinema with an interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to visual effects and moving chairs according to the film's rhythm, the sense of reality here will be strengthened by the felt effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as the selected smells, smoke or fog in the cinema hall.
According to the developer, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonia's tourism revenues by €13 million a year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Exchange as well as on the Frankfurt Exchange.
Last year, the group received EUR 1.8 million in sales revenue in Lithuania and suffered losses of EUR 350,000, according to a financial report by Pro Kapital Grupp.
In 2016, the Lithuanian market generated almost EUR 9 million in sales revenue and earned EUR 2.4 million in net profit.
The T1 shopping centre was built by Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
President Paul Biya is sworn in for a seventh term in Cameroon after controversial elections
During a ceremony overseen by House Speaker Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, 85-year-old Biya pledged to protect the “integrity and unity” of the West African state.
Africa's oldest president, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was declared the winner in the October 7 election, which garnered 71% of the vote.
However, the election was overshadowed by low voter turnout, violence and alleged fraud.
On the eve of Mr. Biya's inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the principal, were abducted at one presbyterian school in the northwestern region, where Anglo-Saxon separatists are waging an armed campaign for independence.
Most of Cameroon's 22 million residents are French-speaking and a fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, the North West and neighboring Southwest province began demanding autonomy amid discontent over alleged discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy.
In 2017, after Mr. Biya refused to indulge, the radicals declared an independent state, the “Republic of Ambazonia,” and raised arms.
According to non-governmental organizations, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces have been killed this year in separatist attacks and government retaliatory operations.
More than 300 thousand people have fled the violence, some across the border to Nigeria, but many are forced to live in half-starved forests.
In October's election, only 5% of voters voted in the Northwestern region and 15% of the electorate in the Southwestern province.
In both parts of the country, Mr. Biya received two-thirds of the vote.
Conservative primary election: The mistakes were caused by inexperience
'Some places have been missing - understand that the party has organised everything with its resources.
Some municipalities allowed their premises to be used, but there were no voting booths everywhere because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank you to those who lent,” the politician said.
There have been complaints, he said, but their content does not change substantially and the offences themselves are not malicious.
'There have been complaints.
Not all the people who took part in the election were experienced - it was also news for them.
So, from that inexperience, not all actions were in line with our order.
Therefore, we should have warned from the CRC that the principles we described should be respected.
Those complaints still have no reason to doubt the results,” Anušauskas said.
According to the chairman of the CRC, there have been cases where ballots have not been sealed - after learning about this, ballots found in ballot boxes have been cancelled without a stamp.
There was a lack of space in some towns, but according to Anušauskas, complaints and irregularities relate to several dozen ballots.
“Well, because the difference is a few thousand, it doesn't really make a fundamental difference to the outcome of the election,” Anušauskas explained.
The party's turnout in the election is said to have been 55%, while non-party turnout was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers, and 600 people worked on commissions.
The results announced on Sunday also remain unchanged, with 79% of voters (16418 votes) voting for the winning Ingrid Shimonyte, while 21% (4441 votes) voted for Vygauda Ushacka.
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will formally support Ms Šimonytė's candidacy in the country's presidential elections in May next year.
Trump says he probably won't meet Putin in Paris
White House National Security Adviser John Bolton has previously said Trump will meet with Putin in Paris to celebrate the 100 th anniversary of the end of World War I this week.
But on his way to the last rallies before the US Congress mid-term elections, Trump told reporters he wasn't sure if it would be the right opportunity to meet with the Russian president.
'I'm not sure if we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not,” the US president noted.
Still, the White House chief added, he will see them at the G-20 summit and “probably meet many times” afterwards.
Mr Trump is still trying to “reboot” relations with Moscow, despite allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 US presidential election.
Kęstutis Strupas asks for annulment of vtek decision
Kęstutis Strupas, former Director General of Santara Clinics at Vilnius University, is asking for the decision of the High Commission for Service Ethics (SEC) to be annulled, acknowledging that transactions that have not been declared in time are already in breach of the law.
Mr Strup's complaint was heard by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be announced on 26 November.
The applicant is asking for the decision of 23 May to be annulled, according to court representative Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduone.
Mr Strup believes the gifts given to relatives should not be declared, and he says he understood the exception to the law in this way.
Vtek announced in May that the then deposed director general of Santara clinics K. Strupas and the head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Division of the Republic Vilnius University Hospital Silvija Strupienė violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
The study found that four transactions were declared in breach of the deadlines: a loan taken from the bank in 2010 with a spouse, a purchase of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift given to her daughter in 2017 - an apartment and a loan granted to a natural person with her spouse in 1996.
Ms. Strupienė also declared these transactions by skipping deadlines.
Those who violate the law on reconciling public and private interests in the civil service cannot be promoted for a year.
The law obliges you to declare not only your own data, but also that of your spouse.
The investigation was conducted by the watchdog on the basis of Info TV television information.
It was examined whether K. Strupas and his spouse, Head of Ambulatory Rehabilitation Division of the Republic Vilnius University Hospital S. Strupienė properly and in time declared their transactions.
According to Info TV, last year K. Strupas gave his daughter a real estate worth 125 thousand euros.
However, the former head of Santara clinics and his wife did not specify the data in their declarations of interest.
Law enforcement has made allegations against Mr Strup, along with at least a dozen others, in a corruption investigation - according to law enforcement, illegal financial rewards were demanded from companies for winning public computers and software purchases in clinics and disguised as support.
In this way, Strup is suspected of having consulted at least five times during public procurement in information technology at Santara clinics.
Mr Strup himself denies his guilt.
Professor Strup, who is suspected of corruption, was sacked as head of clinics in Santara in September.
By decision of the Ministry of Health and Vilnius University of Santara Clinics, the working relationship with K. Strupų was terminated at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since November 10, 2013.
Santara's clinics continue to be temporarily run by Professor Juozas Raistenskis until a tender is held to elect a new CEO, and are expected to be announced later this year.
On the occasion of the anniversary of L. Gutauskas - congratulations from the Head of State
According to the head of state, Gutauskas combines religious, historical and philosophical metaphors, eternal values, and opens up the nation's millennial wisdom and memory.
The author's favourite and appreciated work - poetry, prose, children's literature, painting, book illustrations - testifies to Gutauskas as an artist endowed with diverse talent.
Welcoming the honorable anniversary, the President thanked the artist for his significant works enriching Lithuania and wished him inspiration, happiness and success.
Schools already want to teach differently: promises fewer tests, more practice
Such changes in educational content are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them at the Forum “Development Content Change: Foreign Experience for Solutions in Lithuania” in Vilnius on Monday.
Jurgita Petrauskienė, Minister of Education and Science, who spoke at the discussion, said that over 30 million euros have been invested in updating educational content over the past ten years, but no results have been seen.
“According to the results of the International Student Achievement Survey PISA, students' achievements are below the OECD average,” said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė.
Phil Lambert, an OECD expert cited in a report by the Ministry of Education and Science, said Lithuania was too focused on providing knowledge rather than practical application of knowledge.
According to him, Lithuanian general education programmes focus on students' literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility to develop, but it is also needed to develop children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy and empathy.
Vice-Minister of Education and Science Gražvydas Kazakevičius, presenting changes in the content of general education, said that the scope of the new programmes starting this school year would decrease, they would be more specific and disciplines would be more strongly linked to each other.
According to the Vice-Minister, pupils' education will be more individualised, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare between 10% and 30% of their unique educational content, the current student assessment system will change to a cumulative score, and the competences of an informal student will gain greater weight.
Standardised tests will decrease.
General education programmes are promised to be digital, user-friendly, connected to e-resources and a task bank.
Updating the content of education aims to improve students' achievement in the international PISA study by at least 10%, reduce the gap between pupils' achievements by a third, gain modern competences at school, and be literate in various fields.
Lithuania plans to allocate EUR 7.8 million from the European Union and state budget to upgrade educational content from May 2018.
The project is expected to be tested in some schools during the 2019-2020 school year and will be launched in all schools from September 2021.
The ministry received criticism in early October over a nearly €8 million project by the Centre for the Development of Education to upgrade the general programmes of primary, basic and secondary education.
For four years, €7.8 million has been earmarked for this, and in early October the first purchase worth €1.3 million was announced to look for curriculum developers.
After the experts criticized this purchase, it was suspended, and Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskienė dismissed Giedrius Vaidelis, Director of the Centre for Development of Education.
Lithuania - Exercise on how to respond to extreme flooding
A ten-day exercise to improve institutions' response to extreme flooding begins in Lithuania on Monday.
According to the Fire and Rescue Department (PRT), the exercise will check how public authorities are prepared to work in the country in the event of a state-level emergency, such as flooding: eradicating its effects, coordinating people's search, rescue and rapid eviction from besieged areas, organising their supply of drinking water, food, ensuring the necessary energy supply and providing other measures to protect the population.
More than 100 representatives from all ministries, other institutions, as well as members of 12 municipal emergency operations centers will participate in the exercise.
The preparatory phase of the exercise will take place on 5-13 November, during which municipalities will make decisions on emergency management after receiving information from the Hydrometeorological Service on persistent rainfall and starting flooding.
The active phase of the exercise is scheduled for November 14-15.
During it, the department will operate the State Emergency Operations Center and the Institutional Emergency Operations Centres in state and municipal institutions.
With the government declaring a state-level emergency over the aftermath of the flooding, the prime minister's appointed operations chief will lead the emergency response, the removal of its consequences, and the protection and rescue of residents and property.
Deputy Director of the PRT Mindaugas Kanapickas says that the exercise is most important to check the readiness of institutions to perform statutory functions, assess the possibilities for exchange of information, check how residents, state and municipal authorities, institutions and companies are prepared to alert and inform about the impending disaster, and “improve state institutions' emergency management skills.”
The exercise will also showcase the joint capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters to pump huge amounts of water from the besieged areas.
For this purpose, the BaltFloodCombat module was established in 2009.
Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lucenka resigns
Ukraine's Attorney General Yuri Lucenka announced his resignation in a speech to the country's parliament on Tuesday over resonance caused by the death of acid-ridden anti-corruption activist Katerina Gandziuk, according to Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
Under Ukrainian law, a resignation request must be submitted by the attorney general to the country's president and submitted to the Supreme Rada for approval by a majority.
On Tuesday, Attorney General Lucenko presented the course and results of a law enforcement investigation into Gandziuk's murder order in the Supreme Rada.
In a speech to MPs, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed outrage that Gandziuk's death was being exploited for political public relations.
Ms Gandziuk was a Ukrainian activist and anti-corruption campaigner who spoke publicly about police corruption in her hometown of Cherson in southern Ukraine.
On July 31, Ms Gandziuk, an unknown attacker at her home, sprayed acid in her face.
She died in hospital on 4 November as a result of her injuries.
Protesters at Ukraine's Interior Ministry demand an answer on who killed Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix.
According to Lucenko, the law enforcement investigation features 12 people potentially involved in ordering Gandziuk's murder.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study has been leaked to the media, which threatens the success of the investigation.
According to the attorney general, as a result of the leaks of information, the suspects received substantial knowledge for them.
Mr Lucenko added that he had personally known Ms Gandziuk and was outraged that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
'So that no one has reason to say that someone interferes with the government, I want to state that I'm making a statement to resign.
I will present it to the President of Ukraine today and you will have to discuss this issue in parliament,” Lucenko's speech in Rada is quoted by Obozrevatel.
Lucenko is said to have added that he “cannot allow a duplicity in the country when the law enforcement system is destroyed without any evidence, even for the crimes revealed.”
Lucenko is considered a close friend of the country's president, Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed attorney general on May 12, 2016, after protracted attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, suspected of covering up corruption by top officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy Ž. Vaičiūnas meets representatives of Orlen Lietuva
According to Aurelija Vernickaitė, an adviser to the Minister of Energy, the meeting will focus on achieving renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector that currently does not meet the benchmarks set out in national renewable energy action plans at EU level, with a 6% share of renewable energy in 2015.
The EC estimates that progress towards the mandatory target of 10% in the transport sector is rather slow due to various difficulties, including the relatively high cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and uncertain regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector comes mainly from biofuels (88%) and electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.
Parliament has launched a bid to supplement corruption investigations with a Conservative appeal to others
On Tuesday, the Seimas approved such a proposal, which was registered by Agnė Širinskienė, the “peasant” leading the investigation into illegal influence on political processes.
There were 58 MPs, 27 against, and nine MPs abstained.
The draft will be discussed further by the Seimas Committees, the main appointed Committee on Law and Law Enforcement led by a. Širinskienė.
Following his conclusion, a vote will be held on the adoption of an amendment to the resolution.
The Interim Investigation Commission, which is currently conducting a new investigation into political corruption, has been ordered to investigate possible illegal influence between 2008 and 2016.
A. Širinskienė offered to extend this term by pointing out that “significant information about possible unlawful influence and impact on political processes and state institutions has appeared in the public domain.”
A. Širinskienė identifies in the project “possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or by appealing to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions as the High Commission for Civil Ethics”.
The appeal to the Constitutional Court for pensions was initiated by opposition conservatives.
The ruling “peasants” found that the Conservatives relied largely on arguments from private pension fund lawyers in their appeal.
In an impact on the High Commission on Service Ethics (vtek), “peasant” leaders accuse former comrade Paul Urbshi.
According to them, the former chairman of the Seimas Committee on State Governance and Municipalities may have ordered the members of the vtek to dismiss the former head of the commission's Prevention Division, Mindaugas Narauris.
At the end of September, the Seimas established a commission to examine the possible unlawful influence of stakeholders or their groups, the impact on the course of elections, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary groups, individual politicians, the activities and funding of parties and social movements, legislative processes, the election of members of state-owned enterprises, heads of public bodies, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to look at the information provided by law enforcement and intelligence authorities to the competent authorities on how they responded.
The researchers are expected to present their findings by May 1 next year.
The presidential campaign, the European Parliament's election campaign, will take place at that time.
Of the 12 commissioners, seven are “peasants.”
Two social workers, one “Sudanese,” a liberal and a representative of the Lithuanian Poles Electoral Action-Christian Families Union, were also appointed as members.
The Conservatives and Social Democrats declined to participate in the commission's work.
The new study was initiated by Ramūnas Karbauskis, chairman of the ruling Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union.
He said an investigation by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSGC) last session, largely because of the same things, showed that the investigation needed to continue.
Germany's head of domestic intelligence loses his post
Maassen, 55, also fuelled the controversy by stating that “radical left-wing forces” in Merkel's coalition were to blame for his troubles.
As a result, he was not moved to another post, as previously promised, but forced to leave.
Among other things, it emerged last weekend that at a meeting of representatives of European domestic intelligence organizations in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Maassen criticized Merkel's “naive” immigration policy.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has long defended the intelligence chief, said at a press conference on Monday that Maassen's recent comments were unacceptable and “disappointing personally.”
Mr Seehofer, himself under pressure for both this dispute and his party's poor performance in Bavaria's local elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release Mr Maassen to the caucus.
A string of shark attacks have terrified the entire island - a third person has been bitten
A Queensland Ambulance Service report said the victim suffered “serious leg and wrist wounds” in the attack near Pentecost Island's Sid Harbour off the coast of Queensland state.
The man was taken by helicopter to hospital.
The Pentecost Island is the largest of the archipelago objects of the same name, attracting many amateur diving and sailing boats from around the world.
Shark attacks in the region have so far been relatively rare.
On September 19, one woman was attacked in Sid Harbor and the next day a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay.
The last time a shark attack took place in this archipelago in 2010 before the latest string of attacks.
The CoR has two new members - Wisconsin and Pux
A. Puksas was proposed to the members of the Committee by the Lithuanian Lawyers' Society.
He will replace Dream Šaltauskienė, nominated by the Law Society, who withdrew from it.
Lawyer E. Viskontas has been proposed to the members of the Committee, taking into account the provision of the 'Order and Justice' party.
This party does not have its representative to the CoR when Donatas Laurinavičius withdrew from it.
In a secret vote, Mr Pux's candidacy was backed by 74 MPs, 5 were against and 6 MPs abstained.

Elaborate girls break stereotypes about wedding dresses
A sleek girl with a white fluffy bridal dress - mission (not) possible?
Can a white swan floating towards the altar be larger than S or M size and still look attractive?
Participants in the plus-size reality show “The Evolution of Size (r)” will prove today that the bride's beauty and elegance don't really depend on a woman's kilograms.
But that's not all - one of the girls in the project will be touched by tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will appear on the film scene.
'There are still those who think bigger girls don't get the attention or gaze of the guys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but I like him as I am, he doesn't require a figure that meets some standards from me,” Aurika, a show participant, will say before appearing with a wedding dress.
The wedding dress is not easy, in every sense, the garment is a complex structure, with lots of material, the dress is heavy, uncomfortable for movement.
At the same time, some women think the bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident.
I can reassure you that the properly chosen dress model really solves this' problem ',” explained one of the show's commissioners, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
The girls' fortunes in the project are decided by Kalinkin along with the entire commission - Erika Vitulskiene, who opened a plus-size fashion house, photographer and social networking star Naglis Bieranc and TV producer Laura Pfloor.
'In deciding which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there's a lot of quarrel between the commissioners - after all, we all represent different spheres and we have different views of the winner of the show.
The task of showcasing wedding dresses was made even more difficult by the fact - I can now reveal - that there were two newcomers who were certainly not inferior to the old ones.
It was a special evening in every sense,” Kalinkin says.
The newcomers - 23-year-old Eve, who is known for her scandalous behaviour on one summer reality show, and Dovile, a 31-year-old mother of two children of exceptional beauty - took part in the “Size (r) Evolution” screening and got into the top two.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo shoot of girls on the streets of Vilnius city, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls were returned to the show by LNK viewers who voted for their favourites on the television portal.
The reality show, which has received international recognition, is taking place in Lithuania for the second week, with plus-size girls competing for the name of the country's first plus-size star.
So far, there are only eight of them - and they are all fully aware that the winner will only be one.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show “The Evolution of Size (r)” begins this Monday evening at 20.30 pm on LNK.
Actor Elba has been named the world's most sexy man
Us magazine People has published this year's most sexy man in the world.
It was made by 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
While the man says the news was unexpected when he told of the new title, he was not short of witty.
I thought, 'Can't be!
Seriously? '.
Then I looked myself in the mirror and thought - yes, I look sexy today - the actor shared a laugh.
Speaking frankly, Idris pointed out that this title, it's a very pleasant feeling that has emboldened his ego.
The British star says he often received abusive words and bullying, which made his childhood difficult because, as he puts it, he was “very tall and uneasy.”
The young actor did not meet his peers and became the subject of bullying because of his rare and unusual name and his African background.
“As soon as I grew up, I became the hardest guy in my city district,” Idris smiles.
When a man doesn't have to be on the big screen, Elba works as a discovery at parties held in Spain and especially in buzzing Ibiza.
In his spare time, the man enjoys Thai boxing and has a depth to fashion, which he realizes by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor believes his family is the most important thing in the world, so he plans a wedding with his fiancee Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba became the 33 rd man elected by People magazine to be the world's most sexy man.
Blake Shelton won the title in 2017.
Man beaten to death during drinking in Shirvintai district
On Monday evening, a man was beaten to death during a drink in the village of Šalkiškės in the Širvintai district.
According to the Vilnius County Police, a report was received at 21.16 that a man had beaten a neighbour during a drink.
When medics arrived, they stated the death of a man born in 1943.
The suspect, who was born in 1994 and was diagnosed with 2.53 years of drunkenness, was arrested.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the incident.
Those in power no longer need a distance of 20 km when building waste incinerators
Vilnius cogeneration power plant, near the Gariunai market, is being built.
Those in power no longer want the construction of waste incinerators to maintain a distance of 20 kilometres from the settlements.
Kęstutis Mažeika, the head of the Environmental Protection Committee, registered an amendment to the Waste Management Act in the Seimas on Monday refusing such a requirement.
According to Mr. Mažeika, the Peasant Group, which previously supported the provision for a distance of 20 km, promises to support the amendment because of its refusal.
Mr Mažeika's amendment stipulates that from January 2019, waste incinerators could be built on statutory environmental and public health standards.
He acknowledges that the amendments were prompted by the president's doubts about such a ban.
“Given the definition of the residential area, it is clear that a place where the above objects could be built would be almost impossible to discover,” the committee chairman says.
The ruling majority opposed changes to the president's veto in October that tighten construction of waste incinerators.
In addition to banning the construction of waste incinerators closer than 20 km from settlements, the amendments provided permission for the government to make decisions on the future of the two plants already under construction, taking into account public health concerns.
The latter provisions do not offer an adjustment to Mr. Mažeika.
In Vilnius, the waste and biofuel-fired power plant is built by the energy group Lietuvos energija, and in Kaunas – together with Fortum Heat Lietuva, a Finnish energy group.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipeda.
There is talk of a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
The leaders of Britain and Ireland discussed a possible compromise on Monday on a complex Northern Ireland issue that is stalling Brexit negotiations, Dublin reported.
Speaking by phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered an opportunity to review the so-called backstop arrangement mechanism, which would allow an open border between the UK province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the European Union.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has promised to consider the proposal but has ruled out any possibility of Britain unilaterally withdrawing from the deal, according to a report published by the Irish government.
In the conversation, Mrs May “raised the possibility of reviewing the backstop mechanism,” it states.
“Varadkar has made it clear that he is open to reviewing the new proposals, provided that the outcome of such a review is not linked to a unilateral decision to end the use of backstop measures,” the government report said.
Brexit negotiators are finding no acceptable solution to avoid checks on the land border between the UK and Ireland when Britain leaves the single market and customs union in March next year.
Both sides agree on “backstop measures” to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger trade deal is signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to abide by EU customs rules, but London wants them to apply temporarily to the whole of the UK.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab wants Britain to be able to withdraw from the backstop agreement unilaterally after three months.
However, Mr Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government “cannot support this.”
“The three-month or limited-term backstop is not worth the paper on which it will be written,” he said.
Earlier, London and Brussels failed to confirm details of a breakthrough in Brexit negotiations following a report in Britain over the weekend that a deal was within reach.
“I would say we are continuing to make progress in the negotiations but there is still work to be done,” said Mrs May's London spokesman.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas also told reporters: “We're not there yet.”
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, issued a declaration on Monday calling for access to reliable information in the online era.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are the economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, as well as Nobel Prize-winning writer Mario Vargas Llosa.
“We call on leaders of goodwill on all continents to take steps to strengthen democratic models and open public debate through which citizens can make decisions based on facts,” the group's report said.
They argue that a “global area of information and communication” is a common good that “must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion.”
“People have a fundamental right to information that is freely collected, processed and distributed on the basis of commitment to truth, principles of pluralism of attitudes and rational methods of fact-finding,” the authors of the declaration added.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who often criticizes “fake news” but is regularly accused of distorting facts.
World leaders should take a stand on the issue when they gather for the “Peace Forum” in Paris on November 11-13, signatories have urged.
The declaration came within two months under the leadership of Mr Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, head of the Paris-based media freedom and journalist rights organisation Reporters Without Borders (RSF).

Parliament approves higher fines for harmful products
Parliament approved amendments to the Product Safety Act, which stipulates that fines for product safety violations should be increased.
The amendments were adopted unanimously in the Chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health, said, with regard to the new project, it is to be welcomed that the stated objectives concern better consumer protection for products.
Furthermore, its provisions are adapted to the requirements of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
'In my opinion, the proposed bill distributes better and more specifically to all actors involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As the practice shows, the current penalty system does not always prevent further violations, as those who pay fines continue to commit repeated violations,” Vinkus said.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy and was supplemented by its proposals after approval by the Government.
The amendments to the law aim to increase penalties for infringements, strengthen the protection of consumer rights, empower market surveillance authorities and establish a clear framework for monitoring product safety requirements and compliance.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for manufacturers to properly label the product, thereby ensuring its traceability.
Moreover, according to the ministry, market surveillance authorities have been denied access to producer and supplier territory, buildings, premises and inspections during state product safety controls, which complicates the work of the authorities.
The ministry estimates that the six-month deadline for imposing fines and warnings is too short to identify an offence, conduct an investigation and impose a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the fines imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the law's requirements - 14 companies did so in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Economy proposed imposing an obligation on manufacturers to properly label the product, thereby ensuring its traceability, in order to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to clarify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the right to enter the territory, buildings, premises and inspections of operators who produce, supply products to the market through state product safety controls.
It is intended to increase the level of fines for breaches of the law.
The manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who placed dangerous products on the market and the distributor who placed them on the market would be fined between €150 and €2,500 (now between €144 and €1,448) for providing or providing dangerous services.
A fine of between €1,000 and €5,000 (now between 868 and 4,344) would be imposed if the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (SPS) or another market watchdog decided to ban the placing and placing of dangerous products on the market or the provision of dangerous services.
Failure to comply with the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of between €2500 and €6,500 (now between €1,448 and €5,792).
If dangerous products caused harm to consumer health, a fine of between €2,500 and €15,000 (now between 1,448 and 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused a consumer's death, a fine of between €6,500 and €25,000 (now between 5,792 and 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, a fine of up to 25 thousand euros is imposed for breaching product safety legislation (the minimum fine is not set), in Belgium a fine of 26 euros to 600 thousand euros, in Romania a fine of 155 euros to 6,666 euros, in Bulgaria a fine of 125 euros to 7,500 euros.
10-year-old had a baby: she was raped by a family member

The baby saw the world thanks to a caesarean section, but both the girl and her baby feel good.

Police are investigating the incident for rape and child abuse.
Norway's armed battalion takes part in NATO exercises in the most remote and harsh areas
Troops from the Norwegian armed forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the country's capital, Oslo.
It is part of NATO's “Triple Connector 2018” exercise, NATO's largest exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most troops from Norway's second battalion of military forces spent a lot of time away from home after the September 11 terrorist attacks, in places like Afghanistan - that is, in warm lands.
But most of all, they are at war in the Arctic, and these skills are of great service now that NATO is changing its course of attention.
In recent days in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the most remote and harsh areas, soldiers have been involved in inscribed battles against real British troops.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold wildlife, but in a harsh climate they have to stretch much more weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers staying at the command say they share their skills on how to survive and fight under such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the troops, these exercises, which resemble real warfare like no other, will teach them to be ready if there is a serious threat.

Former Kaunas Vice-Mayor Povilas Mačiulis, who left his job in the municipality and the United Kaunas organization due to his support for Vygaudas Ušackas in the presidential elections, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
'I'm going to concentrate on business.
As a shareholder in several companies, I also have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to spend more time on the family,” Mačiulis said.
He said he also did not plan to participate in the upcoming municipal elections.
Mr. Mačiulis had not yet had the opportunity to talk to V. Ušackas after he lost the primary elections of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union to Ingrida Šimonytė on Sunday.
'To be honest, we haven't yet been able to discuss the results in detail with him and the team and talk about future plans.
Obviously, as Vygaudas withdrew from the next election fight, this phase of my life is over,” Mačiulis said.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas politics because of his support for Ušackas, but regretted that “Lithuania has lost a unique opportunity to have a real leader in the context of international relations.”
Mr. Mačiulis briefly served as deputy mayor of Kaunas in 2011 and later returned to the post after the successful election of “United Kaunas” in 2015.
He is a shareholder in Erudito Lyceum, a private school, and several other companies.
Workers cry at Kaunas Castle: What are they doing here?
After seeing the workers crushing at Kaunas Castle, Kaunas residents hoped that the reconstruction works of the surviving tower were finally underway.
Gabrilius Sužiedėlis, the director of Kaunas City Museum, kauno.diena.lt the portal, assured that works are being carried out to change the coating of security stands of the southwestern tower with a fragment of the defensive wall.
According to the interviewer, the stands will be cans.
'The tin coating worn in an emergency condition was a threat to those around us - people could fall in and get injured - so it had to be replaced.
The stands were no longer moisture-resistant, so it was also detrimental to heritage,” the museum's director explained.
Will these stands be similar to those of a few centuries ago?
“All works are aligned with heritage and other institutions,” he added, seeking to make the result as authentic as possible, but at the same time the practical side is important - the stands must protect values from moisture.
A universal solution was chosen when dealing with heritage.
Before that, the elements of Kaunas Castle were covered with tin during the Soviet era, so they no longer had historical value,” the director of Kaunas City Museum elaborated.
The contract was signed on 2 October.
It is planned that the work will not last more than three months after signing the contract.
“It is expected to be completed by the end of November,” the museum's director said.
According to him, the value of the works performed is almost 24 thousand euros.
This amount, according to the interviewer, was provided for in this year's budget.
The works at Kaunas Castle are carried out by the company “Statija”.
Kaunas. diena.lt has written, according to the studies carried out, Kaunas Castle may have looked earlier.

The US has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea.
The two countries have been working on joint military maneuvers for years, which Pyongyang calls “provocation” and “preparation for invasion.”

Eastern Europe Studies Centre to collaborate with two prominent US 'brain centers'
According to Linas Kojala, Head of the EESC, based in Vilnius and counting the thirteenth year of activity, the USA will be able to implement projects and make Lithuania's voice more audible on the other side of the Atlantic.
'We've been working in this direction for a few months.
I am pleased that the two large institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint action.
I have no doubt that niche activities will arise, because the topics we analyze for NATO, security, misinformation, and development of Eastern Partnership countries are also priorities for them,” Kojala said.
The agreements note that the EESC and US institutions will work together to prepare applications for international projects, exchange expertise and knowledge, and organise expert visits.
This should be of particular benefit to Lithuanian analysts, because both partners have a great international reputation.
Fpri has been operating since 1955 and brings together nearly a hundred top analysts.
In the latest global ranking of analytical centers compiled by the University of Pennsylvania, the fpri ranked seventh in its category.
At the time, cepa, whose analysts have repeatedly been invited to advise and work for top U.S. political institutions, is ranked tenth in its category.
“This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to break into the US Information Area and encourage us to raise the quality bar up,” Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be to help partners distribute the upcoming EESC analytical publication Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review among US decision makers and in the public sphere.
The Eastern European Studies Centre operates on the basis of projects implemented and does not retain targeted grants.
Among the EESC partners with which joint initiatives are implemented are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.

Two people were lightly injured when two buildings collapsed in Marseille in the south of France on Monday, according to the fire service.
Debris burst into the street as buildings collapsed and dust clouds rose.
Dozens of firefighters worked at the scene near Marseille's famous old port, some with shaken dogs.

Afghan special forces member shot American instructor during training
Brent Taylor, the 39-year-old mayor of Nort Ogden, north of Salt Lake City, had gone on a year-long holiday to carry out a mission in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer at the United Forces Headquarters, but was due to return to work as mayor in January.
Another member of the US military, whose name has not yet been made public, was injured in Saturday's attack that claimed Mr Taylor's life.
According to officials, Taylor died from an infantry weapons fire.
Gen. Jefferson S. Burton, commander of the Utah National Guard, told reporters that Mr. Taylor had helped train and strengthen the capabilities of the Afghan National Army.
Utah media cited a NATO report that Taylor had been shot by one of the trained special forces soldiers and that the attacker had been killed by Afghan forces.
Mr Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His remains are due to be flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Monday evening.
He had previously carried out two missions in Iraq, which was also his second mission in Afghanistan.
In January, before leaving for Afghanistan, Taylor told local media that he had been appointed to a team of advisers and instructors to one of that country's special forces battalion.
At the time, hundreds of residents of Nort Ogden gathered on the streets of the city with a population of about 17 thousand to accompany their mayor, who was riding a police-accompanied cortege with his family.
Mr Taylor became mayor of the city in 2013.
