Ethics Sargai: liberals' union board over Vilniaus department's submarine rights
"Board decisions comply with the laws," BNS reported its leader, Vytautas Tamošiūnas, after a panel meeting.
'Our decision wasn't something new.
An explanation as a commission we had already done in July, when there was a question about Pagėgių and Utenos.
We then said that under the laws, this is a matter of board competence.
And if the board decides that some section can behave as it wants, - go with the committee and the board agrees, then the department may go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has adopted, then there's a solution for all chapters to draw up partisan lists.
And if you don't agree with the board, then there's an opportunity to stop membership and go with the committee, "he added.
According to Mr Tamošiūno, the party's board will now decide on further action.
On 17 October, the party's Liberals Union board revoked the decision of the Vilnius City department to participate in municipal elections not with the party but with the list of the newly sailed electoral committee.
According to the party's board, the capital's liberals' decision to participate in elections in the form of a committee of public elections violated party laws, board decisions.
By 31 October, the Vilnius Division had to cancel its ambitions to participate in the municipal elections with the committee's list.
But the department didn't do it.
Parliamentarian Aušrinė Armonaitė, the former chief executive of the department, has already quit the Liberals' union.
The mayor of Vilnius, former president of the Liberals Union Remigijus Šimašius, promising to seek another term of office of the capital's leader, has already presented the team and idea of the Social Electoral Committee "behind Vilnius we are proud of!" they're.

Residents of the village in northern India considered the tractor, which had previously composed one man, officials reported on Monday.
Mahaviras Kaujlagi (Mahaviras Kaudžlagis), a forest surveillance officer, said a man who worked on the fields late on Sunday for the tiger, surrounded the village star and, while trying to break it down, considered him a tractor.
Residents say this tigr also attacked and dragged one youngster about 10 days ago.
The minimal village is in Dudhva's tigr draustin in the Lakhympur district of Kherio, about 250 km south-east of Utar Pradesh's state capital Laknau.
Galabyti tigres are prohibited in protected areas.
Rameshas Pandey (Ramešas Pandėjus), director of the insurance, said police would be notified under the Wildlife Protection Act.
In April, the villagers of Utar Pradeš state in the Nighasan district beat another tigr; this one suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is an Indian national animal; according to the Wildlife Protection Act, the tiger is considered a devastating species.
Last year's government data suggested that at least one person was killed every day in the previous three years during clashes with wild tigers or elephants.
People's conflicts with tigers are gradually increasing since the 1980s, when India launched a Tigers Protection Program, under which insurgents were established in national parks, and the galaxy of great cats began to be considered criminal. Mm-hmm.
Although the tigers' calculation methods have changed, the records would indicate that the then population of around 1,800 tigers increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Proposed cats and dogs mandatory labelling with microschemes
Kęstutis Mažeika, chairman of the Seimas' Environmental Protection Committee, jointly with other members of the Seimas, has registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act, which propose compulsory labelling of cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips.
"We propose that cats and dogs be mandatory to label subcutaneous microschemes, and their registration and labelling would be organised by the local municipality, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be labelled free of charge, and in 2020 - yet cats, so residents won't care and costs will be covered by public funding specifically envisaged, "said the Seimas Environment Protection Committee. President Kęstutis Mažeika.
The bill's amendments aim to address the systemic need for labelling of pets.
This is expected to help avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal producers, illegal reproducers or sellers.
It is preliminarily estimated that, according to the expected average cost of providing the microschem and service, which will be around €5, all pet owners will be compensated in the transitional period.
The total price of all pet labelling can reach up to €6 million.
The need for these funds is expected to be distributed over three years and will reach €2 million annually.
Funds for labelling programs are expected to be allocated through the Specific Programme for the Protection of the Environment of the Communities, which will see a significant increase in revenues this year due to increased taxes and redistribution of natural resources.
This money will be available to municipalities not only for labelling cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programs.
According to K. Mažeika, mandatory labelling practices are widespread in almost all countries of the European Union, allowing animals themselves to be protected (because faults can easily be returned to owners), and saved the time of animal producers themselves when there's a lot of time and money to spend on fleeing and demanding pet searches.
In addition, EU legislation provides that only labelled pets are to be allowed to travel.
At the same time, labelling requires responsible caring for the animal throughout his life.
Previous proposals for mandatory labelling have been reluctant because the respective programs have been proposed to fund the population.
"The model now available should avoid this criticism, because animal protection is proposed to finance increased revenues in the Environmental Protection Support Programme and the right to label not only by giving veterinarians, but also by the public. for those who have attended special courses at the Veterinary Academy," says the authors of the project.
The draft law was registered by a group of members representing the different groups of the Seimas: Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikien, Antanas Vinkus and others.

"Parliaments note that, given how the law forms a ban on the construction of objects of state importance in the management of waste (i.e., distance is established and the concept of" residential territory "is defined)), concluding that this prohibition is disproportionately restricted or even denied the very essence of the right to exercise farming in connection with waste incineration to produce energy, because established criteria are formulated in such a way that, after being assessed, the dancing and distribution of Lithuanians in the country would be practically impossible throughout the territory of the country to construct such objects," it adds.

"Transparency, supremacy of laws, strict respect for international contracts - this must be an essential part of a new investment relationship environment," Mr Grybauskaitė stressed.
"Capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China's import show tries to mitigate criticism, avoiding opening its market and protecting only its businesses.
The exhibition is attended by leaders of several states, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions around the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, China occupies 25th place among export partners.
Last year, Lithuania's exports to China grew by 50% - a total of 180 million euros.
At the same time, imports from China exceeded 820 million euros.
Some officials are worried that China's investment in Lithuania may bring unwanted political influence, while Beijing's exceptional focus on Eastern Europe divides EU unity.

Lion Air revealed cause of plane catastrophe: killer's closest attack
Data from the crashed Indonesian airline "Lion Air" lainer's black box suggest that during at least the last four of its flights a disruption in speed meter work occurred, investigators reported on Monday.
Soerjanto Tjahjono, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSK), said a similar rhythm occurred during the last four aircraft flights, including the Lemting, when the latter fell in the Javos Sea on 29 October. after lifting from Jakarta.
During this catastrophe, all 189 people on the plane were killed.
A lot of media have reported non-discriminations during a previous plane "Boeing 737 Max 8" flight from Denpasaro to the capital of Indonesia.
"When we opened the black box - yes, indeed, the technical problem was the speed of air, in other words, the speed of aircraft," Mr. Tjahjono said during the press conference.
"Black box data showed that during two flights ahead of the journey Denpasaras-Jakarta was also the same problem," he added.
"There are many gands smoothing in social networks.
Now we want to explain that in a black box (the data remained) about four flights during which there were problems due to the speed of air measurement, "the NTSK leader indicated.
During a meeting with members of the killed family, Ms Tjahjono said that the information on the flight recording device corresponded to reports that his speed and height had changed insecurely when the plane returned to the last flight.
Search teams have yet to admire the second black box recording conversations in the pilot's cabin.
"Lion Air" indicated that during a flight from Bali to Jakarta, it was reconciled in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the company's founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to Minister of Transport Budi Karyos Sumadi, a moderate meeting of family members with officials overseeing searches for plane and victims' remains and disaster silence Yeah.
However, he stood up and bent his head when angered and affectionate family members demanded that R. Kirana, along with his brother Kusnan, founded "Lion Air" in 1999, be presented.
"Lion Air" behaved inappropriately, "- said one man, presented as passenger Shandy Johano Ramadhano, a father of the prosecutor's office on the island, in which the plane crashes.
"I want Mr Rusdi Kirana and his team to draw attention," he stressed.
- "Lion Air" has never contacted me since the start of the crisis.
We missed our child, but "Lion Air" didn't show us any reason. "
After this meeting, Mrs Kirana walked out in the pockets, avoiding journalists' questions.
Many families are looking forward to the results of a long process of recognition of the killed.
Police medical experts were handed over nearly 140 lavonmaišies, supported parts of people.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives asked why the loan was allowed to fly two months ago, although a disturbance occurred during the October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, among other things, after passengers were dragged out of Jakarta. I felt the plane crashing down that way after the lift.
"Lion Air" said that this disturbance had been removed.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? - asked one of the dead sons.
- If not, appropriate technicians must be held accountable.
The law was very clear, not they said that the plane was allowed to lift again.
These evil technicians must answer under the law to no longer repeat the plane catastrophe in Indonesia.
S. Tjahjono said that a large amount of small debris and the fact that the debris is spreading in a fairly small area indicates that the laineris most likely crawled into the water by crashing at a very high speed.
"The plane was unique when it fell into the sea.
It didn't burst in the air, and the engines of the plane, when it touched the water, operated in large tangles - it shows all the zero-juice turbine mentality, "the official explained.
"Lion Air" aircraft crash is the biggest aviation catastrophe in Indonesia since 1997, when the company's Garuda plane crash near Medano killed 234 people.

Presidency: No artificial relief needed due to referendum
After Seimui's approval of the governing proposal to reduce the referendum cartel to the first section of the Constitution, which currently has greater protection, the president will correct the face, says its adviser, Mindaugas Lingė.
"More than half of the population voted in favour of the Constitution - that's a requirement.
That and its modification, particularly the articles in its first section, should certainly not be a smaller majority.
It's impossible to predict that the president would certainly be vetoing, "said Dalios Grybauskaitė's adviser to the Knowledge Radio on Tuesday.
He emphasized that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamentals of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, sovereignty of the state, so reducing the number of votes necessary to replace those articles, anot m L. they would create a "negative precedent" and "open up unmanaged risks."
"The President believes that there is no need for any artificial relief, there is more need to prepare for the referendum itself, there is more dialogue with people", - he believed.
The Seimas plans to vote on Tuesday on an amendment to the Referendum Act.
It stipulates that a decision on corrections to the first and fourteenth chapters of the Constitution with a higher level of protection should at least two-fifths of citizens with electoral rights endorse it during a referendum.
At present, more than half of all citizens entitled to vote may replace articles in the first and fourteenth section of the Constitution with a referendum.
Electoral law in Lithuania has about 2.5 million citizens: half would be 1.25 million voters, two-fifths - a million voters.
The proposal was born after the Seimas adopted a veto on amendments previously adopted in parliament in September, softening the calculation of votes by changing Article 12 of the Constitution's first section of citizenship.
The cartel for the referendum is proposed to be cut in preparation for a referendum on double citizenship, it should take place on 12 May next year and 26 May, when the first and second tours of the presidential elections are planned.
Emigrants cannot possess double citizenship, except for some exceptions, on March 11, 1990, following the restoration of independence.
Double citizenship is aimed at the world's Lithuanian community, but fears that a referendum would not happen under existing conditions - a sufficient number of people would vote uncertainly.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "Braška" so they need to be updated
Lithuanian airport and road infrastructure is starting to break down, so it needs to be updated, says Rokas Masiulis, Minister of Transport.
According to him, the modernisation of Vilnius airport is a minimum challenge that the state must accomplish.
"The air transport infrastructure is already braška, as it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius airport - it doesn't even fall into further planning, it's the minimum we must do, "- Mr Masiulis said at a conference on Tuesday organised by the Democratic Development Fund and the magazine" State ".
According to the minister, the next decade will be crucial because important projects will have to be implemented - completed to tie "Via Baltica", "Rail Baltica", built Klaipėda's outer port, upgraded Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and possibly a new airport has been built.
'The next decade will be very important - we need to complete road, railway integration, construction of an outer port in Klaipėda, cutting airports, possibly deciding on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, already start projects that will exploit our potential after 10, 20 or 30 years, "the Minister of Transport said.
Mr Masiulis reiterated that too little money has been spent on car road surveillance in recent years.
'The situation of the roads isn't going through yet, because the funds are not sufficiently allocated.
We're willing to build new roads, but even the most necessary care, for example, on magistrates' routes, lacks funds.
We must determine the amount to which road surveillance should be allocated if we want their condition to improve, "Mr Masiulis said.
He emphasised that exports of transport services in Lithuania grew 18.6% this year, while the biggest export market became Germany, after diverting Russia.
Mr Masiulis has once again criticized the European Commission's proposal that will require carriers in EU countries to return periodically to the country of registration.
"We must strive to make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the suggestion of hopefully returning home is absurd, because empty trucks would ride in Europe, burn fuel, increase emissions.
The railways will mostly win, as the costs will rise so much that part of the transport will pass on to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions, "Mr Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Communications, the transport sector accounts for 12,2%.
Lithuanian gross domestic product (GDP).
It employs more than 118,000 people, operates more than 7,500 companies.
Dispute with heritage conservatives
Last week, Mr Masiulis reported to the Economic Committee of the Seimas that negotiations had begun on a cultural purpose modification of the Vilnius airport building - which would allow the old terminal to be dismantled and a new one to be built.
But Algimantas Degutis, temporary leader of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD), called Mr Masiuli's deliberations political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the sixth century of the past decade is a fortune, recorded in the register in 1993, and not politicians, and specialists must decide whether to remove it.
Mr Masiulis then commented that modern arrival terminals would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
"Taking that old terminal out of heritage would be a politically significant step towards demolishing it and building a new modern arrival terminal, to feel in Vilnius's secluded state, not so interesting, real." We don't represent our country as innovative, "Mr Masiulis said last week in Seime.
Mr Masiulis then also announced that Kaunas planned to build a completely new passenger terminal and airport to connect to the Rail Baltica cancer by building an underground station.
This transport node should operate in 2026, after the end of tie "Rail Baltica."
Yesterday, Vilnius airport discussed about 3.7 million people, 4,8 million passengers are expected this year, and 5 million next.
The Kaunas airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers last year.

'We've always got to get ready for tougher times.
What I want to say is that, for the first time in Lithuanian history, for the third year in a row, we accumulate reserves.
But it's also a very important thing - not to interfere with the disease, "said V. Šapoka on Monday, when he visited Brussels.

Lithuanian work traditions and habits
Recently, 120 years have passed since the birth of prominent Lithuanian photographer and cultural metrologist, ethnographer and kraštotyr Balio Buračo (1897-1972) in Sidaria, Šiaulėnų valsčius, then Šiaulių gubernija.
Mentioning the 100-year anniversary of Lithuania's state, we have a great opportunity to remember how life-threatening nation's revival attracted many people of Lithuania, including their brothers Buračus - Balį, Joną, Bronių - from the village's own depth to all creative I may be involved in the pursuit, ordination and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Buračas, travelling after a birthplace with a camera in his hands for more than 50 years, has provided a wide and realistic picture of our country's customs, traditions, folk arts and material culture.
He aimed to preserve the rapidly disappearing clones of the nation's culture and had a rare ability to comprehend the value of his work.
In Balio Buračo's photographs, Lithuanian landscapes, piliakalnias, everyday and celebratory surroundings, embellished the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines in the nation's costumes of our people.
This publication contains a significant proportion of the legacy of Balio Burač for describing the nation's working habits and associated traditions and, above all, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the self-worth and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilisation over the last century, despite two world wars and a severe occupation.
In the book's writing, it's extremely abundant descriptions of intermediate Žemaitia, particularly kupiškėnų, šiaulėnų, telšiškių, as well as the work of the population of Aukštaitija and Dzūkija, their celebrations and other traditions and habits written by Balio Buračo.
Of the roughly 10,000 negative survivors stored in museums and archives, this publication has been selected in 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photographs that are grouped according to selected texts.
They reflect unique aspects of ethnic culture, characteristic of kupiškėnams, dzūkams, other districts of Aukštaitija and Žemaitija.

Israel's premiere calls "historic day" the entry into force of new sanctions against Iran
"Today is a historic day," Mr Netanyahu told MPs of his party "Likud," his office reported.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of President (Donald) Trump (Donald Tramp), the us introduces particularly severe sanctions against Iran, the toughest sanctions against Iran throughout the period when efforts to curb his aggression began," - said the head of the Israeli government.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman (Avigdor Lyberman) said that the new sanctions would cause a "decisive" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
Measures called "toughest sanctions of all time" by Washington have been introduced following D. Trump's decision to withdraw from the world's power deal with Tehran in May. on his nuclear program.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which have already dropped around a million barrels a day since May, and to prevent Tehran from funding internationally.

Other contracts with Iran participants - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - are not in favour of the U.S. decision and say that the agreement, as has been foreseen, has prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons so far.

VRK's party distribution of money, but social workers will need nothing
The Chief Electoral Commission (VRK) intends this week to distribute a budget grant of nearly €3 million to the largest political parties.
In the spring of this year, governors of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), led by Parliament's vice-president Gedimino Kirkilo, have not yet been scheduled to receive funds from the budget.
But they may already be targeted in the near future by a separate VRK decision, should there be a change in the legal environment governing the distribution of grants to parties.
Laura Matjošaityte, VRK's president, told CIA that "a panel meeting is scheduled this Thursday planning to take a decision on the half-year allocation of the budget to parties".
According to her, the VRK is due to make a decision on this issue by 15 November.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentarians, are estimated to be allocated 2,751 million euros.
Opposition Homeland Union-Lietuvos krikščionys Democrats should receive more than 0.66 million euros, governing Valstiečių ir žaliųjų unions - about 0.55 million euros, opposition Social Democratic Party - about 0.5 million euros, opposition to the Liberals Union - nearly 0.4 million euros, Seime to its faction-neutral Labour Party - about 0.23 million euros, recently joined by the ruling party of the Order and Justice Party - nearly 0.22 million euros, parliament represented, but not for governing, neither the opposition unproclaimed Polish electoral shares-Union of the Christian family - about 0.18 million euros.
Under the existing law, which also leads the VRK, allocating budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes cast in the last Seimas, for themselves. elections by boards and European Parliament.
As a result, current legal regulation does not allow LSDDPs established this spring to expect to receive money from the budget.
Mat this party has not yet been involved in either election.
True, the governing coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers receive at least about a couple of hundred thousands of euros as next year's even three elections - the municipality, the president and the European Parliament - approach.
President Dalia Grybauskaitė vetoed the corresponding amendment to the laws of the political parties and this year's budget.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the governing representatives, Mr Kirkilas, and leader Ramūnas Karbauskis, believe that parliamentarians will seek to reject the president's opposition.
However, this will not happen until this Thursday's VRK meeting, so, according to Mr Matjošaitytė, "grants will be allocated in accordance with and until now existing legal arrangements."
True, the CoR's leader has not accepted that if the Seimas rejects the veto of the President this week or next, and new corrections on the allocation of budgets to parties, a decision on the allocation of an additional grant may be considered in the panel. individual political forces, including LSDDP.
"When making a decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in force, because we are an executive, having to enforce the laws adopted," she said.
Should the Seimas be able to reject a veto and new laws come into effect, the government that allocates additional money to parties, the amount involved should be additionally borrowed.
Grants already allocated to seven parties for such a decision would not be diminished.

Poroshenka: activist Handziuk's assassination orderers must be punished
"I want to say that no version - and more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each will be checked very carefully, in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As president, I don't have the opportunity and I don't have the opportunity to receive information that could hurt the investigation's progress.
But the government must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work efficiently.
Only in this way will it be possible to learn the truth and punish the evil, "Mr Poroshenka said at a meeting with young people on Tuesday in Kiev.
He emphasized that he is most interested in clarifying Mr Handziuk's murder, while killers, organisers of crime and contractors "assume the necessary responsibility."
"After this case has been revalidated into a murder (case), they are threatened with absolutely correct and reasonable imprisonment to a live head sentence," the Ukrainian president said.
He rightly named the public's demand for an open and impartial investigation into the case.
Mr Poroshenka stressed that the remarks made by representatives of the law enforcement agencies in parliament should show that "the government is determined to attract criminals and killers to the responsibility of whatever they would be."
He also said that political speculation on the subject would not help clarify the situation and would further confuse everything.
"I call on all, both the power and the opposition-supporting forces, not to stand up with unjustified arguments and, armed God, not to use this murder for public relations," the president said.
- Conversely, now we need to unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, quick - in a way that keeps the public confident.
We just don't have another way. '
"Nothing will be allowed to take advantage of the situation in the country to destabilise," he reassured.

Seimas approved higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas backed amendments to the Product Safety Act, which stipulated that fines for breaches of product safety should be increased.
Unanimously supported the corrections in the sitting room.
As Antanas Vinkus, member of the Seimas' Health Affairs Committee, said, referring to the new project, it is welcome that the objectives raised concern better protection for consumers of products.
In addition, its provisions are aligned with the requirements of the European Parliament and Council Decision.
'My head, the proposed draft law makes it easier and more concrete to distribute to all executives involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As the practice shows, the current penalty system does not always prevent further violations, because subjects who have paid fines continue to commit repeated violations, "Mr Vinkus said.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of the Economy, following the government's approval by the Seimas Economic Committee, which complemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim to increase fines for breaches, strengthen protection of consumer rights, empower market surveillance authorities and create a clear system of product safety requirements and their compliance.
As stated by the Ministry of Agriculture, manufacturers are currently not obliged to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to ministries, market surveillance authorities were not given the right to access producers' and suppliers' territory, buildings, premises, inspections by means of state product safety controls, which complicates the work of the institutions.
The deadline for six months of imposition of fines and warnings, assessed by the ministry, is too brief to identify the infringement, conduct an investigation and impose a fine.
And, according to the ministry, the fines imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the law's requirements - 14 companies did so in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Agriculture suggested that manufacturers should be required to properly label the product, thus ensuring its traceability, so that it would be easier for market surveillance authorities to clarify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the right to access, through state-owned product safety controls, the area, buildings, premises of farms that produce, supply products to the market, to carry out inspections.
The intention is to increase fines for breaches of the law.
A manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who placed on the market dangerous goods, and a distributor, their direct market, would be allocated between 150 and 2 500 to a service provider who provides dangerous services. (now from 144 to 1 448) euros fine.
State Consumer Rights Protection Service (VVTAT) or other market surveillance authority deciding to prohibit the delivery and supply of dangerous products to the market or the provision of dangerous services would range from 1,000 to 5,000 (now from 868 to 4 344) euros fine.
Without the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them, a fine of between 2500 and 6 500 (now 1 448 to 5 792) would be imposed.
Should the dangerous products have caused harm to the consumer's health, a fine of between 2,500 and 15,000 (now 1 448 to 11584) would be imposed.
Should the dangerous products have caused the death of the consumer, a fine of between €6,500 and €25,000 (now between €5 792 and €23 169) would be imposed.
According to the ministry, in Poland and Austria, infringements of product safety legislation amount to up to 25 thousand euros in fine (minimum penalty rate not determined), in Belgium - from 26 euros to 600 thousand euros in fine, in Romania - from €155 to €6 666 fine, in Bulgaria - from €125 to €7,500.
