It was found that there was no explosion on board a Boeing that crashed in Indonesia.
The Boeing 737, which crashed on October 29 at Lion Air, was destroyed by a collision that came at high speed into the sea.
Surjanto Tanjono, head of the Indonesian National Transport Safety Committee, refuted the alleged explosion on board the plane.
According to experts from the device recording information on board the crew (" black box "), when falling into the sea, the aircraft was in force with an engine.
The conclusion about the circumstances of the plane crash was also based on how the debris of the plane lies in the water.
Parts of the aircraft fell within a radius of close to 500 meters.
A Boeing 737 from Indonesia's Lion Air was flying from Jakarta to Pangkalpinang.
The plane, which disappeared from the radar 13 minutes after it was airlifted, crashed into the Yava Sea between Sumatra and the Western Yava Islands.
All 189 people on board were killed.
The plane's "black box" was found on November 1.
Rescuers are looking for a second device to record the words of the crew.
It is not yet known why the plane fell.
The plane was made in 2018.
A person should think in advance about what he or she will receive from him or her.
Our teacher Askar Tokpanov: I saw that you spoke on television.
Not to survive.
The color of the game is still deep, read Abai, review elsewhere.
He read all the poems of Abai.
I also read a lot of tolls, including poems by Abai and Mukagali.
I read again.
The memory of that read remains.
When I was young, my memory was strong, I learned quickly.
Today, all this is my wealth.
In general, I can easily penetrate anywhere and talk.
I am sorry for those who "play" the title.
This is Bereke!
This month I will receive 42,700 tenge.
Who would have beaten Bergen, I joked.
Now this is probably not a lot of money for some, but for me it is not a lot.
After all, now everything from utility payments to food on the table is sold.
The added money will repay one of them.
Give up the debt.
Thank you to the Head of State!
The state of the country is being adjusted, and "if it is in the country, it falls on the lips," D. Yerzhanov said.
This elevator was the object left since the Soviet Union, which no one needed in the 1990s.
At the same time, the enterprise "Elevator Agrofood" has been fully restored and now stores and sells high-quality wheat with a capacity of 30 tons of clay, which is growing in the Turgai region.
One side is China, one side is Arabs, another is Russia.
In the near future we will install a German mill with a capacity of 70 tons of flour per day, then we will give another 10-15 people a job.
We think that we will be able to increase wages again.
To date, the elevator employs 22 people.
Of these, 5-6 people received 32-33 thousand tenge per month.
This is only the basic salary.
After all, the work in agriculture does not take into account the time, sometimes when it is necessary to carry out additional work, another premium per hour is paid, - said the executive director of the elevator Kurman Abdrakhmanov.
The limited liability company "Elevator Agrofood" is aimed at further development of quality storage, processing of solid wheat.
Now clean and sort it out to boost oats in Iran.
The instructions of the Head of State are strictly fulfilled.
Why if we do not develop economy, if we do not benefit the country?
This should be the duty of every entrepreneur, - said Kurman Turganovich.
The entrepreneur is very strong.
The fact that the Soviet Empire celebrates the 100th anniversary of the Leninist Komsomol in all cities and settlements of Kazakhstan is a challenge to our country.
This means that, first of all, the Komsomolets - the Independence of the Kazakh people - "fell."
Yesterday, at the Semipalatinsk mine, the golden cradle of "Alashorda," which was at the origins of the Kazakh statehood, the followers of the Red Wings, headed by Nurlan Omarov, made every effort to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Red Wings.
Once again, on the Internet, I saw red pioneers wearing red ties in schools in Kazakhstan.
Now these Russians, that is, non-native slaves, saw that they began to openly poison the minds of the younger generation of the Kazakh people.
How can these Komsomolets understand the independence of the Kazakh people and the slavery of Russia?
Oh, sorry, the name of the slaves is a slave!
It should be understood that Ana Tasmagambetov, Aitimova, Sultanovs - their recognition that they are in fact the ears of the colonists, the open expression of their "enduring love" for Russia - first of all, the open recognition of the Russian bodyguard, who today's followers of yesterday's Red Wings still say that we have not come.
In 1986, the current "eternal deputies ": K. Sultanov, B. Aitimova in the famous December 1986, one of them openly covered D. Kunayev, who grew up in the service, Gennady Kolbina, and now one of them:" Kolbin Zholdas, I bring the bitches out of the hair and punish them, "wrote the author of the famous radio play" Zobalan "about the same national tragedy in 1990.
At that time, the Kazakh people did not forget about forced drinking!
As a citizen of independent Kazakhstan, as a child of the Kazakh nationality, I openly condemn the followers of these Red Wings!
If our state is a truly independent state, I am open to the fact that the eternal president of this state has a day when they are openly punished or condemned by the whole country as traitors of the state, openly threatening the independence of Kazakhstan!
"I am sorry, I am gay, I am sorry" (Abai), it was a moment when the whole country openly condemns the Red Helmets.
Oyan, Kazagam, your sleep will never be missed by history.
Never forget this!

Usha, local resident: - In the morning, the air is dirty, smoke.
You can't even open your eyes.
Children can't go to classes.
I went to the street and opened my eyes.
Liza, an Australian traveler, said: 'In the morning I had to go back to the hotel after going some land on the street to visit the city.

I remember the forced fall of fresh air in the country, and I was convinced that a lot of work is carried out in this direction in Avstarlia.

Almaty has started the VII International Film Festival of Student Films "Bastau."
This year's film festival will be chaired by the famous director, screenwriter, teacher Irakli Kvirikadze.
The jury included Silvan Kutandin (" Letter to Stalin "), Russian actress Elvira Bolgova (" My Armenian wedding, "stepdaughter "), Kyrgyz director Temirbek Birnazarov and Kazakh Sabit Kurmanbekov.
Along with the main jury in "Bastau" there is a jury of young cinematographer students.
This year the student jury includes students from Spain, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia.
Spanish director Yago Mateo Velasco, who was the winner of "Bastau" just two years ago, is now the chairman of the jury, which will assess the works of talented students.
There are plenty of film festivals around the world, but "Bastau" is a festival that really opens the way to a successful, good start.
The fact that the festival is international is beneficial for students, and we are here to understand a little bit internally what the cinematographer expects in the future.
Of course, there is an Oscar, there is a Cannes Film Festival, but it is impossible to go to it immediately, so it is good to have a ladder like "Bastau," which leads to big bucks.
The most important thing is literacy, a new look at the birth, we are uncertain, we want to give young talents a guide to the world of big festivals, - says Yago Mateo Velasco.
The guests of honor of the festival were the Dean of the Faculty of Film Production of Korea University of Media Kim Yong Du, the sound engineer of "Mosfilm" Marina Nigmatullina and the film operator, the teacher of Karpenko-Karogo University in Ukraine Evgeny Filippov.
The jury and guests of the festival will hold creative meetings and master classes with students of Almaty, film specialists studying in the specialty of cinematography.
All events of the festival, master classes will be held at the National Academy of Arts named after T.Zhurgenov and the University "Turan."
The platform of the international film festival is important for young people.
From the first job, the student should see not only what the competition is, what the classmates shoot, but also how their peers in other countries are looking.
The participation of the film in the festival is separate, it is very important to communicate with the creators of the film, to exchange views.
"Bastau" is a very necessary step to establish creative relations.
Despite the difficult circumstances, the difficulty of moving to great cinematography, cinema is developing.
Film festivals are desperately needed for the same purpose.
Cinema is a collective work, the international film language is universal, and we contribute to its development.
Here we will not only watch cinema, we will learn how to do it, president of the festival Sergey Azimov said.
According to the organizers, the festival of student films, which was presented in the Soviet period, continued during the period of independence and this year is held for the 7th time.
Despite the difficulties, the film festival continues to live even after it has managed to attract the interest of the film community.
