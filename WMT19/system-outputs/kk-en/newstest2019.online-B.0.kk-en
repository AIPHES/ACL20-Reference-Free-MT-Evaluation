Suicide bombers of the Soviet empire are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Leninist Komsomol in all cities and towns of Kazakhstan - a challenge to our country.

Now these Russians, that is, the idle slaves, seeing that the younger generations of the Kazakhs have begun to open their minds, have been cursed by the words of the devil ... What a terrible thing!

Anas Tasmagambetov, Aitimova, Sultanovs - acknowledging that these are really the servants of colonial patrons, and that "open to infinite love" to Russia should be understood, first of all, as the open tannation of modern-day followers of yesterday's red-handed guerrillas, who is still in Russia.
In 1986 the present "eternal deputies": K.Sultanov, B. Aitimova, 1986. in December, when one of the most famous of them, Dunaik Kunov, who grew up in his office, cursed Gennady Kolbin, and another said, "Kolbin's comrade, I will bring them to you and drag them out of your hair." At that time Zhelgalinskaya, as an author of a well-known work of the world wave, one hour radio program on radio "Azattyk" in Munich, 1990, under the Soviet empire, in particular, my poet Zhumash Kokboury, I will not forget it yet!
At that time, the Kazakh people, who had come to their senses, did not forget!
As a citizen of independent Kazakhstan, as a true motherland of the Kazakh nation, I openly condemn the followers of these red flags!
If our state is truly an independent state, I would like to openly note that the eternal president of that country is openly threatening the Independence of Kazakhstan and openly publicly condemn them to the people or be the whole country!
"My dear country, my dear, amazed" (Abay), this is the time when the Komsomols of the Red Crescent became the whole country.
Awakening, pride, your sleep will never come to an end.
Never mind your pride!

At the briefing in Astana, the question was raised on the initiative group's initiative to change the name of the region.
I'm familiar with the letter.
I saw it.
Generally, my position is against.
After all, the Kostanay region has its name from the history.
If I am not mistaken, this letter has been signed by 17 people.
I know a few people.
Sabyrzhan Akhmetuly, a local akim in many areas, personally refuses to say, "I have not signed this letter".
