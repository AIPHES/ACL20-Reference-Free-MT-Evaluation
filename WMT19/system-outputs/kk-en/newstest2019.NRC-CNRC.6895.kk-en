The Head of State supported the idea of setting the Day of Shymkent.
Today at a meeting on social and economic development of Shymkent, the head of the city Gabidulla Abdrahimov asked the President to set City Day.
Historians say that Shymkent is already 2200 years old.
We are currently preparing special documents in UNESCO.
But how many centuries have passed, the official date of our city is not yet set.
The special status of our city will be approved by the special Decree of June 19.
In this regard, the public of the city offers to designate the date of the city, G.Abdrahimov said.
The President did not object to such an initiative.
However, the city did not justify the date of real historical data, but proposed to begin with it.
In fact, Shymkent is an ancient city located on the Great Silk Road.
There are Shymkent, Taraz.
Ideally I have no objections.
If we consider 2200 years, we will call it so, we will start with it.
But it should be proved, - N.Nazarbayev stressed.
Today, the President of Kazakhstan outlined specific directions of development of the city of Shymkent.
The rules of fight against "black archaeology" will be approved.
After the "black archaeologists" monuments remain open and disappear.
This was announced by Minister of Culture and Sports Arystanbek Mukhamediuly during the presentation of the bill "On protection and use of objects of historical and cultural heritage" in the Majilis.
It is necessary to revise the issue of regulation of archaeological, restoration works carried out at objects of historical and cultural heritage.
It is no secret that our unique monuments or yet unstudied objects are often searched and excavated by "black archaeologists", after which the monuments remain open, partially or completely destroyed.
In addition, there are cases where intensive construction works, carried out in the territories adjacent to the objects of historical and cultural heritage, have a significant impact on the historical integrity and preservation of historical and cultural monuments, leading to negative consequences.
In general, it is definitely necessary to strengthen tasks requiring clear regulation in the legal sphere and to create favorable conditions for protection and use of objects of historical and cultural heritage, - the Minister stressed.
According to him, in this regard, at the legislative level it is necessary to approve the order of identification and accounting of objects of historical and cultural heritage, as well as monitoring of their condition, introduction of qualitatively new mechanisms of preservation and use of objects of historical and cultural heritage on the final historical holiday.
In addition, it is proposed to establish rules and conditions of carrying out archaeological works and combating "black archaeology", to settle the legal mode of use of land plots in protected areas, construction of historical and cultural monuments, to determine the legal mode of use of zones of the natural landscape.
In the process of drafting the bill was studied and studied international experience.
For example, the Russian legislation introduced measures to counter "black archaeology" for carrying out illegal archaeological investigations, abductions of archaeological items, avoidance of the implementation of artefacts to the state, etc.
That is, criminal responsibility is provided.
In Italy, there are obligations for private collectors at the legislative level.
In accordance with these, it is envisaged creation and phased renewal of lists of objects of culture and art representing historical and artistic interest and those in private property.
In addition, the objects located in their property, regardless of nationality, the citizenship of the owners of these objects, are subject to state protection, A. Mukhamediuly said.
