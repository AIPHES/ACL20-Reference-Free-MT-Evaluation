I read a lot about Abai, Mukagali and his works.
I read it again and again.
This book will be remembered for many years.

This elevator, which remained since the Soviet Union in the 90s, was not necessary for anyone.
The plant's management is planning to increase the yield to 30 tons of wheat per hectare.
Russia is interested in our Turgai region's wheat on one side, China on the other, and Arabs on the other.
In the near future, we plan to build a powerful German mill with a capacity of 70 tonnes of flour per day and employ 10-15 people.
We also want to increase salaries.
Today, the elevator employs 22 people.
We have increased salaries by 5-6 people, who receive 32,000-33,000 tenge per month.
This applies only to the basic wage.

The celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Leninist Young Communist League in all cities and settlements of Kazakhstan is a great event for the Soviet empire.

When I saw the red tie in schools in Kazakhstan on the Internet, I was surprised.
Now these are the Russian kulaks, that is, the descendants of the Kazakh people who have already started to learn the Kazakh language.
How can these Young Communist Leaguers understand how they want to restore the Kazakh statehood and overthrow Russia?
I think this is a great honor for me.
We must recognize that today's followers of yesterday's Red Ribbons are the most open expression of their love for Russia, not least because they are truly colonialist slaves.
In 1986, the current "eternal deputies" - K. Sultanov, B. Aitimov, D.

The Kazakh people, who were forced to drink at that time, will never forget it!
As a citizen of independent Kazakhstan, as a native of the Kazakh ethnic group, I openly condemn the followers of the Red Ribbons!
If our state is truly independent, I would like to say frankly that the eternal president of this state openly punishes them as traitors to the independence of Kazakhstan, or openly condemns the entire country.
"broad masses of the people of my country, who are executed, are shocked" (Abay). this red gesture of the Young Communist League of the whole country is a moment of open condemnation.
Oh, I would like to say that your story will never be forgotten again.
I will never forget it!

In addition, intensive construction works are carried out on the territories adjacent to the objects of historical and cultural heritage, which have a significant impact on the historical integrity and preservation of monuments of history and culture, and have a negative impact on the situation in the country.
In general, in the legal sphere, which requires clear regulation and creation of favorable conditions for the protection and use of historical and cultural heritage, there is an obvious need to strengthen the tasks in this direction, "the Minister said.
According to him, in this regard, it is necessary to define and record objects of historical and cultural heritage at the legislative level, as well as to establish a procedure for monitoring their state, to establish the order of preservation and use of objects of historical and cultural heritage in their final historical appearance, to introduce qualitatively new mechanisms for their preservation.
In addition, it is proposed to define the legal regime for the use of land plots in protected areas, regulation of the construction of historical and cultural monuments, the legal regime for the use of natural landscape zones.
The international experience was studied and taken into account during the development of the bill.
For example, the Russian legislation introduces measures to combat illegal archaeological research, theft of archaeological objects, evasion of artifacts from the state and other "black archaeology."
In other words, criminal liability is provided for.
In Italy, there are legal obligations for private collectors.
According to them, it is planned to create and periodically update lists of objects of culture and art of historical and artistic interest that are in private ownership.
At the same time, regardless of the nationality of the owners of these facilities, the objects owned by them are subject to state protection, - A. Mukhamediuly said.

College leaders are deceiving the country and the authorities.

By artificially increasing the number of graduates employed, the administration of educational institutions often fails to provide assistance in the employment of graduates.
