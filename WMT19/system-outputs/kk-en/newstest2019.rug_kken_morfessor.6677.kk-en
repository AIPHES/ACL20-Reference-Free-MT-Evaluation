The conclusion about the circumstances of the plane crash is also made to look at how the fragments of the aircraft are in the water.
The aircraft was shot down in an area close to 500 meters in radius.
The Boeing 737 aircraft of the Indonesian company Lion Air flew from Jakarta to Pancampang.

A person has to think in advance about what a book will get from it.
My teacher, Askar Tokpanov: I have seen you speaking on television.

In addition to the poems by Abai, Mukagali and others, I read a lot of poems.
I read again and again.
It is written in the memory of the people of Kazakhstan.
When I was young, my memory was strong, and I was lying fast.
Today, everything is my wealth.

For those who "play" the title, the soul of the deceiving.
God bless you!

The state of the country is improving, and "if we are in the country, we will have our lips," D. Yerzhanov said.
This elevator was an object that was left from the Soviet Union, and nobody needed it in the 1990s.
According to experts, the plant will be able to produce up to 30 tonnes of wheat, which will be grown in the Turgai region.
We are interested in the wheat of the Turgai region - China, the Arabs on the one hand, and Russia on the other.
In the near future, we will lay a mill with a strong German capacity of 70 tons of flour per day, and then we will work for 10-15 more people.
We are planning to increase salaries.
Today, the elevator employs 22 people.
Among them, we increased salaries for 5-6 people, who receive 32-33 thousand tenge per month.
This is only the basic salary.
After all, work in agriculture is not allowed with time, and sometimes, when it is necessary to do additional work, it is paid an hour more, - says the executive director of the elevator Kurman Abdrahman.
According to experts, the agricultural sector is one of the most important sectors of the economy.
Now Iran is trying to clean up and sort it out in order to increase the oil prices.
The President's instructions will be strictly fulfilled.
Why don't we use the country without developing the economy?
It should be the duty of every entrepreneur, "says Kurman Turganovich.
I think that this is a good idea.
It is a great honor for us to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Leninist Komsomol in all the cities and settlements of Kazakhstan.
This means, first of all, that the Komsomol members "have entered the independence of the Kazakh Yeli."
Yesterday, the golden cradle of "Alashora," which is the origin of the Kazakh state, was launched on the Internet in Semey shahar.
Once again, I saw on the Internet the red pioneers wearing a red tie at schools in Kazakhstan, and I kept my collar.
Now, when they saw that the Russian, that is, the unborn slaves, began to openly poison the minds of the younger generation of the Kazakh people, they were tied to the mother tongue without the words...
How can we understand that these Komsomol members have rejected the independence of the Kazakh Yeli, and that they are slaves of Russia?
After all, the name of the slave is a slave!
Ana Tasmagambetov, Aitimova, Sultanova - it is their own recognition that they are truly the slaves of the Makhnovists, the open expression of "boundless love" for Russia - first of all, the open recognition of the freedom of Russia by today's followers of yesterday's Red Hundreds, who have so far been left behind.
In 1986, there were "eternal deputies": K. Sultanov, B. Aitimova, in the famous December 1986, one of them was born in the village of Zolkent, in the village of Otyrar, in the village of Otyrar, in the village of Otyrar, in the village of Otyrar.
The Kazakh people, who were taken from the ruthless, did not forget about it!
As a citizen of independent Kazakhstan, as a descendant of the Kazakh nation, I openly accuse the followers of these red gentiles!
If our state is truly an independent state, I would like to say openly that the eternal president of this state has given birth to a day when he openly punishes and condemns the people as betrayals of the state, openly threatening the independence of Kazakhstan, or as a whole country!
"Thick country, dead land, poor people" (Abai), this beautiful woman was the first to openly accuse the Komsomol people of being the whole country.
Oyan, Kazak, your dream story will never be forgotten.
This is never the case with Umtyk Kazak!

The jury includes Sylvan Kutandin ("A letter to the Stain"), Russian actress Elvira Bulgova ("My Armenian wedding," "Ogea's daughter"), Kyrgyz director Temirbek Birnazarov and Kazakh actress Sabit Kurmanbekov.

This year's student jury includes students from Spain, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia.
The Spanish director Yago Mateo Velasco, who became the winner of "Bastau" two years ago, is now the chairman of the jury, who will evaluate the works of talented students.
There are a lot of film festivals in the world, but "Bastau" is a festival that opens the way to a really successful and good start.
The fact that the festival is of an international level is beneficial for students, and we are here to be able to get a little bit of an understanding of what is expected of the film in the future.
Of course, there is an "Oscar," the Cannes Film Festival, but it is impossible to go there immediately, so it is good to have a ladder like "Bastau," which will lead to a big competition.
The main thing is literacy, a new approach to the world, we want to open the way to the world of great festivals for the unknown, young people, - says Yago Mateo Velasco.
The honorary guests of the festival are the Dean of the Faculty of Film Production of Korea University of media arts Kim Yong Doo, sound director of the "Mosfilm" Marina Nigmatullina and a cameraman, teacher of the Carpenko-Karogo University in Ukraine Evgeny Filippov.
The jury and guests of the festival will hold creative meetings and master classes with students, film professionals of Almaty.
All festival events, master classes will be held at the National Academy of Arts named after T. Zhurgenov and "Turan" University.
For young people, the platform of the international film festival is important.
The student should not only see what the competition is, what the cadets are doing, but also what their peers in other countries are looking for.
The film's participation in the festival is separate, communication with the filmmakers and exchange of ideas is even more important.
"Starting" is a necessary step towards building a creative relationship.
Despite the complexity of the film, the film is developing.
Film festivals are also necessary for this purpose.
Cinema is a collective work, a universal international cinema, and we make our contribution to its development.
The festival's president, Sergei Azimov, says that we will not only watch films, but also learn how to make them.
According to the organizers, the festival of student films, which was premiered in the Soviet period, was continued during the period of independence, and this year it is held for the seventh time.
The film festival is still alive after the film community managed to evoke interest despite the difficulties.

This was announced by Minister of Culture and Sports of Kazakhstan Arystanbek Mukhamediuly during the presentation of the draft law "On the protection and use of historical and cultural heritage sites" in the Mazhilis.
The settlement of archaeological and restoration works at the sites of historical and cultural heritage requires revision.
It is not a secret that our unique monuments or unexplored objects are often subjected to searches and excavations by "black archaeologists," after which the monuments remain open and partially or completely destroyed.
In addition, there are cases when intensive construction works in the areas adjacent to historical and cultural heritage sites have a serious impact on the historical integrity and preservation of historical and cultural monuments and have negative consequences.
In general, it is necessary to strengthen the tasks that require clear regulation in the legal sphere and create favorable conditions for the protection and use of historical and cultural heritage sites, - the Minister said.
According to him, in this context, at the legislative level, it is taken into account the procedure for the identification and registration of historical and cultural heritage sites, as well as the monitoring of their condition, the introduction of qualitatively new mechanisms for the preservation and use of historical and cultural heritage sites in the final historical form.
In addition, it is proposed to establish the rules and conditions of archaeological work and fight against "black archaeology," to regulate the legal regime of the use of land in protected areas, the construction of historical and cultural monuments, and to determine the legal regime of the use of natural landscape zones.
During the development of the bill, international experience was studied and taken into account.
For example, Russian legislation includes measures to counter "black archaeology" in the conduct of illegal archaeological research, theft of archaeological objects, avoidance of the sale of artifacts to the state, and others.
That is, criminal responsibility is provided.
In Italy, there are obligations for private collectors at the legislative level.
According to them, the lists of objects of culture and art of historical and artistic interest are created and updated in time.
In addition, regardless of the nationality, citizenship of the owners of these facilities, the objects in their ownership are subject to state protection, - A. Mukhamediuly said.

College leaders are deceiving the country and the authorities.
The prosecutor's office of East Kazakhstan region inspected the activities of colleges in the region and identified numerous violations, as well as the cases of misuse of budgetary funds.
In particular, during the placement of the state order, the facts of non-compliance with the competitive procedures, false training of students, illegal assignment of grants, failure of teachers to meet the requirements of qualification, failure to provide students with dormitories, as well as the receipt of income from the illegal lease of state property were revealed.
It has often been the failure of the school administration to provide employment assistance to graduates by artificially increasing the number of graduates in the workplace.
Despite the fact that the rules of placement of the state educational order were violated, in particular, students from other places were not provided with dormitories, the Department of Education of the region annually awarded grants to the College of Business and Service in Semey, polytechnical college in Ayagoz and two colleges in Ust-Kamenogorsk.
College administrators have included the costs for public utilities, which are included in the total amount of the contract on the state order, in the price of accommodation in the dormitories, providing rooms in the dormitories for rent to third parties.
In Kurchum College, 12 students were falsely trained.
The teachers and the masters of industrial training during the training classes in the theoretical and practical educational journals assessed these students, sent them to the intermediate attestation, transferred them from the course to the courses.
In addition, these students received scholarships and the total amount of damage to the state amounted to 8 million tenge.
A pre-trial investigation is underway.
The facts of illegal use of property for personal purposes are also revealed on the territory of the college.
For example, on the territory of the East Kazakhstan Regional School of Arts named after the brothers Abdullinov people's artists, there is a long paid parking lot.
After the prosecutor's recommendation has been introduced, the parking lot will be closed and a sports field will be built in its place.
According to the results of the investigation, the prosecutors found damage in the amount of more than 43 million tenge.
According to the supervisory acts, 36 million tenge has been produced so far.
60 people were brought to disciplinary responsibility, 4 - to administrative responsibility.
