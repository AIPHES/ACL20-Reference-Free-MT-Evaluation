This elevator was an object that remained in the Soviet Union in the 1990s was not necessary for anyone.
The company "Elevator Agrofud" has been rebuilt by hand, and now it is less likely to grow in the region of Torgay. The clay, which keeps the quality wheat around 30.
One side of the wheat of our Torgai region is China, one side of the Arabs, Russia is interested in lies.
In the near future, we will have a strong mill of German power, which will attract 70 tons of flour, where we will work for 10-15 people.
We think that the situation is still increasing.
Today there are 22 people in the elevator.

This is only the main salary.
The work in agriculture will be paid even more to the hour when it is necessary to carry out additional work, - said the executive director of the eleventh Kurgan Abdrahman.

Now it is cleaned and sorted for a grey increase in Iran.

The word of the real businessman is strong.
The bloodthirsty of the Soviet empire is the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Leninist Komsomolsk in all cities and settlements of Kazakhstan - the criticism, the brothers.
This means that, first of all, the Komsomolsk - the Independence of the Kazakh country "I smoked".
Yesterday, the golden cradle of "Alashor", which stood at the beginning of the Kazakh statehood, also in the Semipalatinsk temple, the followers of the Red Woman who started today Nurlan Omarov, built the forces with the heads of the former Komsomol, and the information about those who celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Red Woman came to the Internet.
From the Internet, I saw the red tie in schools in Kazakhstan and kept the beach.
Now these are the Russians, i.e. the Slavic castles of the earth, who saw that the minds of the young generation of the Cossacks came to an open poisoning, not to mention the word of the mother's arsenals... It is a gracious thing!
How can this coms confiscate the independence of the Kazakh Page and understand the meaning of the kulaks of Russia?
Oh, good luck, the name of the castle is a slave!
Ana Tasmagambetov, Aitimova, Sultanov - we must admit that they are truly the kulaks of the Ottoman Empire, the open expression of "unlimited love" in Russia - first of all, today's followers of the Krasnoyarsk Women's Azerbaijanis still open recognition of Russia's liberation.

Konnayev, who is open to Gennady Kolbin, has been rolling out of charge, now one of the following: "Kolbin sent me, I am going to get rid of the bloodstream, and I am going to be punished with punishment." Mr. Konstantin, who took part in the campaign, wrote about one national tragedy in the Soviet Empire in 1990.
And the people of the Kazakh people, who were consumed from the immorality, didn't forget!
As a citizen of independent Kazakhstan, as the native speaker of the Kazakh nation, I openly accuse the followers of this red woman!
If our state is indeed an independent state, it is open to say that the eternal president of this state is exposed to the independence of Kazakhstan, who openly threatens them as the saturation of the state, who is openly punished before the people, or accusing the whole country!
"The country of Kala, the current, the shelter of the proletariat" (Abay), this red wife of the Komsomolsk was the whole country, and the moment of the openly accused.
Hovhannisyan, Kazan, your now sleep will never stop history.
Don't forget that!

The jury includes Silvan Kutandino ("Letter to Stalin"), Russian actress Elvira Bolgova ("My Armenian wedding", "Girl"), Kyrgyz director Temirbek Birnazarov and Kazakh Sabit Kurmanbekov.
Together with the main jury, the jury also works with young cinematographers-students in accordance with the tradition of the year "Start".
This student group has students from Spain, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia.
Only two years ago, the Spanish director Yago Mateo Velasco, who became the winner of the beginning, was the chairman of the jury, who now assesses the works of talented students.
There are a lot of film festivals in the world, but "Start" is a festival that opens a way to a successful and good start.
The international level of the festival is effective for students, and we will be able to make a slight impression that the cinema is waiting for us in the future.
Of course, there is "Oscar", there is a Cannes Film Festival, but it is not possible to go straight to it, so it is better to have a staircase such as "Bastau", which leads to big bots.
The most important thing is that a new look of literacy is born, we don’t know, we want to go to the owners of young people to the world of big festivals, - says Yago Mateo Velasco.
As an honorary guest of the festival, the dean of the Department of Cinematography of the Korea university of media arts Kim Yen Du, the sound director of the film "Mosfilm" Marina Nigmatullina and the film operator, the lecturer of the Karpenko-Karsky University in Ukraine Yevgeny Filippov was invited.
The jury and the guests of the festival asked students of Almaty on the specialty of cinematography, creative meetings and master hours with film specialists.
All events, workshops will be held at T. Zhurgenov National Academy of Arts and Turan University.
The International Film Festival is important for young people.
It is necessary to see that the student from the first work is a competitor, not only that the cursors were shot, but also the peers of other countries.
The participation of the film in the festival is also important, as well as the interference with the creators of the film, the exchange of thoughts.
"Start" is a very necessary step to establish creative relationships.
In spite of the difficulty, the film is developing, despite the difficulty of making a step in big cinematography.
Film festivals are also very important for this purpose.
Cinema is a collective work, a universal international cinema, we contribute to its development.
Here we will not only see the film, but also learn how to do it, says the president of the festival Sergey Azimov.
According to the organizers, the festival of student films presented during the Soviet period will continue in the period of independence, which is held 7 times this year.
Despite the disappointment, the film festival is still alive.
