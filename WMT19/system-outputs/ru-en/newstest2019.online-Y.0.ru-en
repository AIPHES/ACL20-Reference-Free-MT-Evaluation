Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly the theme of Russia in a negative way was almost absent
The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it will be able to become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as a an integral participant in solving global problems. $
“The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric to which we have almost become accustomed in recent years concerning Russia, now was much more muted”, - declared Senator in an interview published on Sunday “Rossiyskaya Gazeta”.
He explained that in previous years Russia was sometimes “designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, then along with Ebola fever, then along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in the in any case, in the statement of a group of Western countries, which spoke fairly unanimously in this regard.”
At the 73rd session, Kosachev emphasized, “the theme of Russia in a negative way practically was absent”.
“If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the USA, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I now don't take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir is not was absolutely accurate ", - the politician drew attention, having noticed that Russia “was no longer a certain wall about which train blows with a tennis ball”.
The head of the relevant committee of the Security Council does not rule out that this indicates a certain tendency which, in his opinion, “will allocate the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend is fully may appear in a year, in two, three.”
“I do not rule out that the current session in some sense can be a turning point”, - Kosachev admitted, explaining that “too many examples of how Russia manages to move forward in the international affairs.”
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
“While it, unfortunately, not Ukraine, but I have no doubt, as the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis too will be in demand over time”, - the parliamentarian added.
This is due to the fact, he believes that there is “adequate, common perception of Russia as not just possible - an integral participant in solving global problems of our time”.
“I wouldn't want to be mistaken, but I have a feeling that we where - that pass the point behind which movement any more won't be a reversal movement, it will be movement forward”, - he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context Kosachev called “a request for the Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
“I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I saw with great pleasure that If a year or two or five years ago, the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, nobody was interested, now the situation is different ", - said the chairman of the Committee of the Council of Fed.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that “the so-called new liberal order, which is personified with the West, there are no answers to questions how to solve world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in global space, the lack of ideas on how to deal with the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problems of migration.”
“And here the request for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious”, - Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that he considers in this sense “the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation. successful for Russia ".

Authorities called the sum of the “golden parachute” Voronezh deputy governor
One-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronezh region Yury Agibalov made on the basis of the regional law “On public positions”.
Thus the real sum of “a gold parachute” released from a position of the acting official was several times less than the sum sounded in mass media.
Such explanations were provided by the press service of the regional government.
According to the law, the salary for the position of Agibalov is 11,189 rubles.
Thus, stressed in the press service, the amount of the lump sum payment was net of income tax 223 892 rubles, instead of 1 million rubles, which was written by the media.
The official received an old-age insurance pension from July 2018.
His service in public office is more than nine years.
Appointment of this pension and lump sum payment is made immediately after dismissal from office, explained to agency “RIA Novosti” in the regional government.
Thus payment to Agibalov of an additional payment to pension suspended at appointment to a public office, and the size of his salary has not changed in comparison with the previous period.
The acting governor of the region Alexander Gusev, who won the elections of the governor of the region, took office on September 15.
Agibalov was dismissed in connection with the expiration of the term of office of the acting head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public positions in the region came to an end.
On September 29 Telegram-channel “Nezigar” published documents, which showed that Agibalov, who resigned from the position of vice-governor, was paid severance pay in the amount of 23 salaries, and two days later after that he again received a similar position without the prefix “acting”.

ADG became the second most popular in Germany
Anti-immigrant “Alternative for Germany” breaks another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel ratings fall.
Apparently, the Germans began to get tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which made the country a coveted target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most clearly this is evidenced by recent polls, according to which the anti-immigrant party “Alternative for Germany” is becoming more popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, the ADG broke another record, rising to the second place in the ranking of popular sympathy.
Right conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be written off for statistical error, but it is important to note the fact that the ADG of a small group of eurosceptic economists, created in 2013 managed to turn into a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall standings still continues to hold the ruling bloc of HSS/CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - back in April the support of Angela Merkel block was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also reduced.
Today in support of Angela Merkel speak 48 percent of Germans, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
We will add that after Social Democrats are “green” (15%), left (11%) and liberals (10%).
Evolution of “Alternatives”
The party “Alternative for Germany” was founded in September 2012 on the basis of the group “Alternative Choice 2013", which included people from the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government policy, but initially dealt with only economic issues, including the euro and EU interaction.
At the same time, the group opposed the “sponsorship” of Germany of the weak economies of the EU, did not exclude the possibility of returning to the German mark and the full withdrawal of the country from the European Union.
With the deepening immigration crisis, the political platform of the ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed into a full-fledged party, which occupied a niche of Euroskeptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the ADG managed to break through to the Bundestag for the first time, gaining 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of “Alternative for Germany” get seats in the European Parliament.

Named the date of death of the universe
The universe will last for about 140 billion years, ten times the age of the observed world, which is about 13.8 billion years.
The research of the international team of scientists is laid out in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and directed to publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, according to Japanese Asahi Shimbun newspaper.
To such conclusions experts came, observing with the help of the camera HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) of the Subaru telescope for about ten million galaxies.
Having traced the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 per cent of the energy mass of the observed world, scientists working under the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Cold Dark Matter), estimated the pace of expansion of the universe, which turned out to be slightly slower than previously thought.
Subaru observatory press release notes that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the data of the European space telescope Planck $ clarified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of the ΛCDM.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the Universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments for the fact that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Divide.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
The opportunity to find out the opinion of the people on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
In Moscow on Saturday, a meeting of the federal initiative group of a referendum against raising the retirement age was held.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that registered different formulations of the questions (the Central Election Commission registered five formulations).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a petition for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians a question: “You are for the fact that the legislation on pensions as of 1 July 2018, the age at which Russian citizens are entitled to an old-age pension has not been raised?”
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and legally capacious one.
Most of the participants of the meeting were supporters of a member of “Just Russia” Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist Party (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier Sviridov told “Vedomosti” that invitations were sent to all initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, head of Vologda subgroup (its wording was supported by 15 other subgroups), told Vedomosti that the invitation did not receive and did not plan to come: “We did not understand who is a friend and who is an enemy.”

In the match “Loko” - “Akhmat” Turbin's mistakes were poured as from the horn of abundance
The former judge of the All-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the referee Evgeny Turbina in a match of the 9th round of the championship of Russia “Lokomotiv” - “Akhmat” and sorted controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the refereeing of Evgeny Turbin in the match “Lokomotiv” - “Akhmat”?
- I consider that this arbitrator confirmed the unsuitability for refereeing of matches of the Russian prime minister - league.
I am surprised that the pressure in the meeting of the fifth round of “Spartak” - “Dynamo”, neither Turbin nor heads of MDI made serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not slow to affect in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private omissions of rough techniques were poured out as from the horns of abundance.
For example, on the 50th minute of the railroad worker Eder is filled with hands in his penalty area by the defender of “Akhmata” Rodolfo.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put a penalty.
- How do you estimate the episode involving Idova, which was on the 82nd minute, when it seemed that the ball hit his hand?
- I consider that here there was a deliberate game with a hand of the defender in the penalty area.
The turbine was near the moment, well sees the episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment had to be seen and reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three slept, and the penalty was not assigned.
Therefore, the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice was trampled.
It was the same case when refereeing on concepts displaced and buried the sports spirit of the game.
- On 52-й to minute Turbin didn't dare to remove the defender of guests Oleg Ivanov who broke rules in fight against Kryhovyak and when the judge showed it a yellow card, defiantly applauded it.
What do you think about this episode?
You had to show a second mustard?
- In this moment, Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite on business.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov told after the match about double standards of refereeing that some teams put a penalty for such violations as in an episode with Idova, and some isn't present.
What do you evaluate the words of the player?
- Depends what is meant by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't give him.
So, the referee does not give a second penalty in the opposite gate.
Here is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge watches who plays.
Here played on Saturday “Lokomotiv” and “Akhmat” has serious claims to work of Turbin because the team was disadvantaged.
Matt Damon played Judge Cavanaugh accused of raping at SNL start
American actor Matt Damon played the candidate for the Supreme Court of the United States Brett Cavanaugh, who is accused of raping.
Damon appeared in the first release of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.

The candidate for the Supreme Court of the United States has previously drawn attention to his emotion and detail of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchard.

Barbra Streisand found her cloned dogs strange behavior
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behave completely differently than the original pet.
“They don't look alike.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul ", - said the 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Straisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog breed Coton-de-tulear named Samantha, which had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018 it was reported that the dog breed Chihuahua nicknamed Miracle Milly (Miracle Milly), which was called the smallest dog in the world, cloned for the 49th time.

US thinking about the sea blockade of Russia because of the supply of oil and gas
In the United States can start a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the world energy market.
American authorities are so zealously engaged in the struggle for success in the world market of hydrocarbons that are ready to resort to the sea blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main suppliers energy carriers. $
About the possibility of a sea blockade the day before told the Interior Minister of the USA Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to world practice, the United States Department of the Interior performs civilian functions rather than police, including policies in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke's statement came quite within the competence of the department headed by him, though it was not deprived of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinka said that thanks to the naval forces of the United States control sea routes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
From the words of Zinke it followed that the need may be connected with the desire of Washington to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.

“It's an ugly nepity.”
Spectators are outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show “Voice”
Spectators of the show “Voice 60 +” accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of “ugly nepotism and brazen rigging”.
When in blind auditions he learned from the first notes the voice of his father Nikolay Agutin many hoped that he would remain neutral and would not turn to the performer.
But filial feelings prevailed, and he chose a relative to his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor bias at the first stage.
But the “joke” was prolonged, and the father of the star absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutin such injustice.
Yesterday we, the audience of the show, were indignant with neposterity ugly and frank dragging of our close relatives on the final ladder.
I already even doubted that Agutin will have enough strength and conscience not to drag until the end of the father absolutely already to the first place ", - Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina argued in the program “Man from TV”.
Meanwhile, for the sake of the father Leonid Agutin “merged” beautiful performers who really sang while Nikolay Petrovich whispered touching song about mother, having explained it to that audience and They want to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, it is not so, the audience wants an objective assessment and see in the final really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited the show.
“I sympathize with the participants of “Voices” from the team of Agutin - they were doomed ".
“Last time Agutin showed how much he loved his dad, and today he had to prove himself a professional.”
“The contest has lost its meaning.”
“Remove from the project two talented people and leave in the project his father who does not sing but whispers, how can you then call a mentor?” , $
“Like how Dad sings, organize him a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert.”
It's the Voice show, not the Cool Relatives show.
“From Agutin's side it was unprofessional.”
“Then it is necessary on own show to offer to speak to the father, instead of on a show which is made for money of channel 1.”
“It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why was the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre leaked, and the father of Agutin brought to the final?
And then we all complain that on stage and on screens the same faces for decades!
Yes because not to break through neptism!”
“What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
Circumcated blat and nepity.
And money in the family budget will not be superfluous!
The theater of absurdity continues!”
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of traditional “Voice” on blind auditions there was a son of Gradsky.
Then the meter and in the head didn't come to take the son in own team.
Moreover, he said, “Come on, get out of here, it's clear.”
Agutin could not act as a professional.

I lost all the positions I played at the start, the moment, immediately.
Found himself in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We hoped that after the rest came to the pit stop, we will get into “clean air”, and the pace will return, but there was no rubber.

President of the Tennis Federation of Russia (FTR) Shamil Tarpischev commented on the removal of football players from Moscow “Spartak” Denis Glushakov and Andrey Yeshchenko from training with the main squad after the likes on the criticism of the head coach of the team Massimo Carrera, reports “Sport weekend”.
Carrera's actions were totally absurd.
To pay attention to such things is unimaginable stupidity.
I absolutely disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It only deepens the discord in the team.
First of all, it is poetry that you can read and perceive them as you like.
If I were Carrera, I wouldn't react to that.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to be funerary.
If Glushakov and Eshchenko put likes, it doesn't mean that they have something against the trainer.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility of perception of the situation.
And it does not serve the normal climate in the team.
Today “Spartak” doesn't have a game, so this situation didn't need to inflate at all.
Maybe we should have laughed at it together.
At “Spartak” much is not in order in different lines, there is a lack of play after introduction into structure of youth.
Relations within the team, apparently, don't add optimism before this match ", - Tarpischev is sure.
The game of the two teams will take place on September 30 and will start at 19.00 Moscow time.

“The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a huge benefit.
This is the explosive growth of medical technologies, it is the improvement of quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is a second side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually a technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There is a reverse side - purposeful intervention in human life.
There are always risks.
There was a car - people began to perish under wheels.
But cars still use.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I create medical new technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction ", - quotes the scientist REN TV.

Kemerovchan revolted a herd of sheep in a cemetery
On September 30 on the known Kemerovo page on a social network there was a message from the eyewitness that on one of local cemeteries horned animals freely walk.
Animals considerable herd walked between fences and plucked grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: someone from locals noted that in presence at a cemetery of small cattle there is no harm, and their appetite even can help in clearing the territory from weeds and grass thickets, but some of the residents of the city did not like animal behavior: $

There's nothing to do with the sheep.
Of the sheep, of course, you can't say that they blasphemy, but it's not the case.” (style is kept) - the indignant Kemerovchanka noted in the message.

What is the right thing to do?
The word to press doesn't exist.
That's the right thing to do.
The word “push” in the meaning of “gravitate, influence,” exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word “pull”.
We use that word because we believe it comes from the word “pressure.”
But “pressure” and “bear” etymologically not only are not close, but even in a sense opposite.
Make sure for yourself.
Take it (church. -book, outdated) - means “enough, enough, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy”.
To be happy, pleasure - related words.
Previously, it still had the meaning of “not to depend on anything, to have self-satisfied meaning” - “to bear”.
Old Slavic “dovleeti” is related to words “to order” and “will”.
Pressuing, suppressing - completely different.
These words are truly frightening “relatives”: daos - “wolf” (pressing sheep), deyja - “die” and dvaidī - “oppress”.
The similar phonetic appearance of the words “pressure” and “bear”, as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
So we have this very “d [a] to draw”, which on the letter is used through “a”, which, in a good way, is wrong and impossible from the point of view of the processes of emergence and development of these words.
So, the right thing is to do.
But this word is outdated, in its correct meaning is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word “push”.
You can also use the “exert pressure” design, but remember that this is the office.

The US is satisfied with the growth of opiate production in Afghanistan
About the sharp aggravation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 much talked in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on Afghan territory fighters unleashed a real terrorist war against public authorities and civilians of the country.
This year was a record year in the number of bloody terrorist attacks, which resulted in the death of thousands of ordinary Afghans,” Patrushev noted.
Afghanistan's troubles did not begin yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group “al-Qaeda” (banned in Russia), settled in Afghanistan.
Less than a month ago America and NATO allies launched a military operation “Enduring Freedom”.
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of American contingent and now on Afghan soil.
And peace life is even more ghostly than it was then.
American troops are driven behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As can, pay off from fighters for money - only to them didn't touch.
The government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40% percent, according to Patrushev.
50% - from the Taliban movement (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% - for terrorists of ISIS (banned in Russia).
But they grow up there fast.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly what they did not succeed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be satisfied with this.
As well as the fact that for 17 years of American presence production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan increased at least 40 times.
A huge increase in the area planted with opium poppy and multi-billion dollars in profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in the referendum on accession to the EU and NATO, subject to change the name of the country.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize $ for its northern neighbor the right to be called Macedonia, seeing in such a name an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovski, political scientist: “Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia gets the right to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will secure its right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises cannot make everyone happy.”
The ruling Social Democrats led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev are in favor of renaming the country.
Against - the conservative opposition and the president of the country Gheorghe Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: “Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current the socialist government led by Zaev is imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice made by the citizens of Macedonia will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole.”
