The number of new recruits from Ukraine preparing to send to Donbass is named
The official representative of the People's militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) Andriy Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine will send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbass.
According to him, thus Kiev plans to "at least somehow complete the units".
"Unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass layoffs have led to low staffing", - said Marochko, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians called up for the army can be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the operation of the Joint Forces (JF).
This measure was supposed to strengthen the role of Ukrainian security forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbas deteriorated due to the murder of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities qualified the incident as a terrorist act.
During the investigation of the criminal case were detained several people involved in the explosion.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by the Ukrainian secret services.

British Foreign Minister compared the EU with the Soviet Union and prison

This statement was made by the diplomat at the Congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
According to the Daily Mail, thus Hunt commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to faith in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave.

In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the issue of the Irish border remains open.

Trump noted that Barack Obama's team so launched relations with the DPRK that it could not even call the country's leadership - there simply did not remove the phone.
Then the US and North Korea were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader is writing "fine letters" to the White House, Trump said.

But now their relationship has improved so much that the leaders "fell in love with each other".

Nitsoy urged to replace the "Moscow language Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of her native language Larisa Nitsoy called for ousting from Ukraine "the Russian-language Moscow product and the Moscow language".
She proposes to do it with Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural pressure".
Nitsoy shared her thoughts on the "advisability of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian edition of "Observer".
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language", she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said, earlier on television and radio the Russian speech was widely used, but in the public space it practically didn't remain.
At the same time, according to Nitsoy, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: The actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "the expansion of borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level".
Previously, Nitsoy shared her experience of maintaining the "Ukrainian-speaking regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court network of bookstores Watsons, the cashier of one of which communicated with her in Russian.
Not having achieved the, Nitsoy threw in the girl delivery.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians "linguistic schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the writing of surnames.
Recently Nitsoy declared that the name "Russia" was stolen from Ukrainians so Russia should be called Moscow.
The anger of the writer could not avoid even the Security Service of Ukraine: Coming there and hearing conversations with each other in Russian, she caused a scandal and left, slamming the door.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly the topic of Russia in a negative way was almost absent
Head of the Federation Council Committee on Foreign Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it can become a turning point in the perception of Russia as an integral participant in solving global problems.
"The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my opinion, lies in the fact that the rhetoric to which we are almost accustomed in recent years against Russia, was now much more muted", - said the senator in an interview published on Sunday",Rossiyskaya Gazeta".
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes "identified as one of the three main threats to humanity, now along with Ebola, now along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, at least in the statement of a group of Western countries, which spoke quite unanimously on this subject".
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed",the topic of Russia in a negative way was virtually absent".
"If we carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at least, the choir was not quite accurate", - said the politician, noting that Russia "was no longer a wall, which trains blows with a tennis ball".
The head of the relevant committee of the Security Council does not rule out that this indicates a certain trend, which, in his opinion",will allocate the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may be fully manifested in a year, two, three".
"I do not rule out that the current session in some sense may be a turning point", - admitted Kosachev, explaining that "too many examples of how with the involvement of Russia managed to move forward in international affairs".
He cited the situation in Syria, Iran and North Korea as examples.
"So far, unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time", - added the parliamentarian.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is "an adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just a possible - an integral participant in solving the global problems of our time".
"I would not like to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that somewhere we pass a point beyond which the movement will no longer be a reverse, it will be a movement forward", - he added.
Kosachev called another "interesting and important feeling" in this context "the request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop".
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly], Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I saw with great pleasure that if a year or two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, in general, no one was interested, but now the situation is different", - said the chairman of the Security Council Committee.
According to him, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which is represented by the West, has no answers to the questions of how to solve world problems due to the obvious shortage of ideas in the global space, lack of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, terrorism, nuclear non-proliferation, migration".
"And here the demand for the Russian vision becomes more and more obvious", Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that in this sense he considers "the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia".

AfD became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland is breaking another popularity record, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
It seems that Germans are getting seriously tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has made the country a desirable target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
This is most evident in recent polls, according to which the anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) is gaining popularity and Merkel and Seehofer's ruling bloc are weakening.
This week, the AfD broke another record, rising to second place in the ranking of popular sympathy.
Right-wing conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to a statistical error, but it is worth noting the fact that the AfD, created in 2013 from a small group of Euroskeptic economists managed to turn into a serious political force.
The leadership in the overall ranking is still held by the ruling CSU/CDU bloc, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - back in April, support for Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, down 7 percent from last year.
The Social Democrats were followed by the Greens (15%), the Left (11%) and the Liberals (10%).
Evolution of "Alternatives"
The party "Alternative for Germany" was established in September 2012 on the basis of the group "Alternative choice 2013", which included people from the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government's course, but initially dealt only with economic issues, including the euro and EU interaction.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of weak EU economies, did not exclude the possibility of a return to the German brand and the country's complete withdrawal from the European Union.
As the immigration crisis deepened, the AfD's political platform expanded.
In 2013, the group became a full-fledged party, which took the niche of Euroskeptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to make its way to the Bundestag for the first time with 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of Alternative für Deutschland win seats in the European Parliament.

The term of death of the universe is named
The universe will last another 140 billion years, ten times the age of the observed world of about 13.8 billion years.
Research of an international team of scientists posted in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and aimed at publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts came to such conclusions by observing about ten million galaxies with the help of the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) camera of the Subaru telescope.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the mass energy of the observed world, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model "Cold Dark Matter" ("Cold Dark Matter"), estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which was a little slower than previously thought.
The press release of the Subaru Observatory noted that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the data of the European Space Telescope Planck clarified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of the CDM.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Divide.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
Opportunity to learn people's opinion on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the federal referendum initiative group against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that registered different formulations of questions (the Central Election Commission registered five formulations in total).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a request to register a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Are you in favor of not raising the age established by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, after which Russian citizens get the right to an old-age pension?"
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and most legally capacious.
The majority of participants were supporters of Ilya Sviridov, a member of Just Russia (six subgroups) and the Communist Party (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier Sviridov told "Vedomosti" that invitations were sent to all initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (her wording was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she had not received an invitation and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who is a friend and who is an enemy".

In the match "Loko" - "Akhmat" mistakes Turbin poured out like from the horn of abundance
The former judge of the All-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the championship of Russia "Locomotive" - "Akhmat" and analyzed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How you estimate Evgeny Turbin's refereeing in a match "Locomotive" - "Akhmat"?
- I believe that this referee confirmed his unsuitability for refereeing matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that pressure in a meeting of the fifth round of "Spartak" - "Dynamo", neither Turbin, nor heads of DSI didn't draw serious conclusions about its low qualification.
The result didn't slow down to affect in the ninth round: Mistakes in his actions, private passes of rough receptions poured as from a horn of abundance.
For example, on the 50th minute of the railway Eder fills with hands in his penalty area defender "Akhmata" Rodolfo.
From a gate eight meters, but Turbin doesn't put penalty shootout.
- How you estimate an episode with participation to Idov who was on the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball got to his hand?
- I believe that there was a deliberate play by the defender in his penalty area.
Turbin was close to the moment, and his first assistant on the right saw the episode well.
This moment had to see and reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three slept and no penalty was imposed.
Therefore the score in a match is distorted, and sports justice was violated.
It was that case when refereeing by concepts displaced and buried sports spirit of game.
- On the 52nd minute Turbin didn't dare to remove the defender of guests Oleg Ivanov who violated rules in fight against Kryhovyak and when the judge showed it a yellow card, demonstratively applauded it.
What do you think about this episode?
It was necessary to show the second "mustard man"?
- In this moment Turbin and the first yellow card showed not absolutely on business.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov told after a match about double standards of refereeing that to any teams put penalty shootout for such violations, as in an episode with Idov, and any isn't present.
What do you assess the football player's words?
- Watching what to mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
He was not given.
It means that the referee does not give a second penalty in the opposite gate.
Here is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the referee looks who plays.
Here I played on Saturday "Locomotive" and "Akhmat" has serious claims to Turbin's work because the team was infringed.
Matt Damon played accused of rape Judge Kavanaugh at SNL launch
American actor Matt Damon played U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
In a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on charges of rape.
The U.S. Supreme Court nominee has previously attracted attention for his emotionality and detail of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
Thus, Kavanaugh repeatedly confessed his love for beer, but said that he had never drunk to the point of oblivion.
In addition, in an attempt to plead guilty to charges of rape, Kavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin at the time.
Those moments were also beaten by Damon.
I only did that much drank and at all didn't think of sex.
I was the proudest, most drunk virgin anyone had ever seen.
Everyone knows this",- said the judge performed by Matt Damon.
Kavanaugh had previously been elected US chief justice.
Barbra Streisand discovered strange behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behave completely differently from the original pet.
"They are different.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul",- said the 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old cat-de-tulear dog named Samantha, who had to fall asleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the dog breed Chihuahua nicknamed Miracle Milly (Miracle Milly), who was called the smallest dog in the world, cloned for the 49th time.
Specialists are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
U.S. thinks about naval blockade of Russia because of oil and gas supplies
The United States may begin a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the world energy market.
The U.S. authorities are so eager to fight for success in the world hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main energy suppliers.
U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke told about the possibility of a naval blockade the day before.
Contrary to world practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior does not perform police, but civilian functions, including the implementation of natural resources policy.
Therefore, Zinke's statement came quite within the competence of his department, although it was not deprived of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the Navy, the U.S. controls the sea lanes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
According to Zinke, the need may be related to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from supplies to the world market of oil and gas.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow's activation in this region, Zinke said.
The Minister made it clear that the United States still expects to secure leadership in the world energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to push Russia and Iran, and the sea blockade of trade routes - an acceptable measure along the way, said Zinke.

"This is ugly nepotism"
The audience is outraged by Agutin's choice on the show "Voice"
The audience of the show "Voice of 60 +" accuses mentor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen fraud".
When in blind auditions he recognized the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But son's feelings took over, and he chose the relative in the team.
Then many considered it as joke, but forgave to the instructor bias at the first stage.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the star's father absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now already the audience isn't ready to forgive Agutin of such injustice.
Yesterday we, the audience of the show, were indignant at the cronyism of the ugly and frank dragging of our close relatives to the final ladder.
I already even doubted that Agutin will have enough strength and conscience not to drag up to the end the father absolutely already to the first place",- Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the Man from TV program reasoned.
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father Leonid Agutin "merged" beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience wants to see his father in the show.
But, as it appeared, it at all so, the audience wants an objective assessment and to see in the ending of really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited show.
"I sympathize with the participants of" Golos "from Agutin's team - they were doomed".
"Last time Agutin showed how he loves the father, and today had to prove to be the professional".
"The contest has lost its meaning".
"To remove from the project two talented people and to leave in the project the father who doesn't sing and whispers, how it is possible to call after that the instructor?",
"I like the way dad sings, organize a concert in the Kremlin for his own money and see how many people will come to this concert".
This is the show "Voice", not the show "Cool relatives".
"It was unprofessional on Agutin's part".
"Then you have to offer to play your dad on your own show, not on a show that is made with Channel 1 money".
"It was a real chance for someone, and it took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why the worker from Surgut with magnificent voice and timbre merged, and father Agutin brought to the ending?
And then we all complain that on stage and from the screens the same faces for decades!
Yes because not to break through nepotism! "
"What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!
Around blessing and nepotism.
And the money in the family budget will not be superfluous!
The theater of absurdity continues! "
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" on the blind auditions came the son of Gradsky.
Then to a meter and in the head didn't come to take the son in own team.
Moreover, he said",Come on, come from here, everything is clear".
Agutin couldn't act as the professional.

I had a good start, and in the second turn I found myself between two cars, which immediately clamped me.
I lost all those positions which I played at start, moment, at once.
It appeared in very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
It was hoped that after the rest of the pit stop, we will get into the "clean air", and the pace will return, but there was no rubber.
Plus fought with the partner, with it too there was a contact.
As I understand it, he was a little mistaken.
We were in such a situation on the most unraced track of the season, I could not do anything, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to speak about it any more",- quotes Sirotkin RIA Novosti news agency.

Tarpishev called absurd the removal of Glushakov and Yeshchenko from the basis of "Spartacus"
President of the Tennis Federation of Russia (FTR) Shamil Tarpischev commented on the removal of players of Moscow "Spartacus" Denis Glushakov and Andrei Yeshchenko from training with the main team after likes to criticize the head coach of the team Massimo Carrera, reports "Sports Weekend".
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is nonsense.
I absolutely disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It only deepens discord in team.
First of all, these are poems, you can read and perceive them as you like.
I on Carrera's place wouldn't react to it in any way.
Everyone after all has the opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to be healthy.
If Glushakov and Yeshchenko put likes, it doesn't mean that they have something against the trainer.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to perceive the situation.
And it doesn't serve the normal climate in the team.
Today",Spartacus" has no game, so this situation did not need to inflate.
Maybe it was worth laughing at together.
"Spartacus" is not in order in different lines, there is a lack of play after the introduction of the youth.
Relations within the team, apparently, do not add optimism before this match",- said Tarpischev.
The two teams will play on September 30 at 19: 00 Moscow time.
Earlier refused to "Spartak" John Terry headed Chelsea youth team.
Pupils of "Sirius" discussed with scientists nature-like technologies
Pupils of the educational center "Sirius" in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatov Institute".
The speech of researchers took place in the framework of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Nature-like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by a documentary film "Kurchatov Codes", during which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The lecture of the scientist is published on the website of "Sirius".
The students learned that modern technologies need a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to develop such volumes.
According to the organizers of the forum, nature-like technologies, on which young scientists are working today, will help to solve this problem.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, as well as spoke about the risks that inevitably arise in the creation of such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a colossal benefit.
It is explosive growth of medical technologies, it is improvement of quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is a second side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually a technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There is a downside - purposeful interference in human life.
There are always risks.
There was a car - people began to die under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I create medical new technology, and thus I can create weapons of mass destruction",- quotes the scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
The speakers were Yulia Diakova, Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-like technologies of the Kurchatov Institute, and Vyacheslav Demin, Head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS technologies.

Macedonia: Referendum failed due to low turnout
The referendum was intended to approve an agreement between the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country "Northern Macedonia".

However, since the referendum was only consultative, it is possible that the authorities in Skopje will decide not to refuse the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the closure of polling stations, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a supporter of changing the name of the republic, said that if there is more "yes" among the votes cast, Macedonia will change its name, despite the unachieved quorum.

Kemerovo residents were outraged by the herd of sheep in the cemetery
On September 30 on the well-known Kemerovo page in a social network there was a message from the eyewitness that on one of local cemeteries horned animals freely walk.
The animals walked among the fences and plucked the grass.
Commentators have expressed different opinions: One of the local residents noted that in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery there is no harm, and their appetite can even help in clearing the area of weeds and grass, but some of the residents of the behavior of animals did not like:
"These are graves, not pastures.
The sheep have nothing to do there.
About rams, of course, you won't tell that they blasphemy, but nevertheless not business it".(Style is kept) - the indignant resident of Kemerovo noted in the message.

To push and to win - how it is correct?
The word push does not exist.
It is correct - to dominate.
The word "push" in the sense of "pull, influence, influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "pull".
We use this word thinking that it comes from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "dominance" are etymologically not only not close, but even in a sense opposite.
See for yourself.
It is enough to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy.
To be content, pleasure - related words.
It used to have the meaning "not to depend on anything, to have a self-sufficient meaning" - "to dominate".
The Old Slavonic word "dovleti" is related to the words "command" and "will".
To press, to suppress - absolutely others.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": DAOS - "wolf" (crushing sheep), deyja - "die" and dvaidī - "oppress".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "dominate", as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter, forced them into conflict.
So we have this very "d [a] fly", which is used in writing through "a", which, in a good way, is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of emergence and development of these words.
So, it is correct - to dominate.
But this word is outdated, in its proper meaning is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word "pressure".
You can also use the "apply pressure" design, but remember that this is the office.

With the help of the operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, of whom 85,000 were killed by the Russian Air and Space Forces.
This was told in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria, former commander of the Air Force, head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Bondaryev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of means of destruction from the air: Aerospace forces struck and continue to strike all strikes exactly at terrorist targets.
According to Bondaryev, tens of thousands of terrorist targets have been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition depots, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian air strikes, the defense of jihadists was hacked - this was a decisive contribution to the advancement of Syrian government troops, Interfax reported.
At the same time, according to Bondaryev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (ISIS, banned in Russia) and Jabhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the side of ISIS fought about four thousand militants from among the Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries, reports TASS.
And we are talking only about the registered persons, not including those who have not been identified, said Bondaryev.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any moment, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, said Bondaryev, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant borders - otherwise this evil "would flow to us".

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the UOC with the actions of fascists
Metropolitan Hilarion, head of the Synodal Department for External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate into the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It is like in fascist Germany to aim a yellow pointed star at a Jew, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created", - said the Metropolitan on the TV channel "Russia-24" (quote from Interfax).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and "outlaw it", believes the clergyman.
"It is the Ukrainian church, and believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of the country", - he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills № 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), № 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and № 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).

At different times in history, our predecessors and Christian relatives had to confess their faith and defend their holy places.
Taking into account the situation that has developed, and the information we have, and the death threats that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to endure something",- said the Metropolitan.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
The Lavra's deputy also stressed that it is likely that "your physical presence will be needed".
The clergyman added: "Lenin's grandchildren - in spirit, threaten to kill, and therefore protect their sacred".
Those who care about the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - an Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine - should be ready to protect it, the appeal reads.
The Metropolitan urged not to follow the example of those who mislead believers.
UOC has canonical status, determined by Tomos on October 29, 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to make dependent on the news patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has",- said the deputy Lavra.
He recalled that the UOC since October 1990 is canonically independent and completely independent in its management.
There is no administrative or financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact Tomos our church already has.
What other Tomos do we need? "- noted Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochaev, urging the faithful and all citizens to ask whether other confessions have Tomos, are they independent of the Vatican?
Believers to some extent understood and decided in what temple they go.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and discord again.
Some are fed up with envy that the domes shine on the temples that they want to destroy",- said the priest.
Pochaev Lavra is the largest church complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The Lavra is located on the top of the Pochaev mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the 13th century.

The main Macedonian opposition refused to vote in the referendum
Macedonia is holding a referendum on Sunday, 30 September, on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece to rename the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
Nevertheless, the leader of the leading opposition party "Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity" (VMRO-DPNE) Christian Mitskoski said that he would not vote in the referendum.
As explained by party spokesman Naum Stoilkovsky, Mitskoski decided to abstain from voting to express his disagreement with the treaty, which he considers "harmful".
According to the spokesman, the current referendum resolves the issue of renaming the country and nothing more, while the strategic goal of the party - to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, Macedonian President Gheorghe Ivanov also refused to participate in the September 30 referendum.
He explained that he chose the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence.
"A new semi-sovereign state with a new name is being created", Ivanov said.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic - the Republic of Northern Macedonia - was signed by the Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece on June 17 this year during a ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, which is the border between the two countries.
This treaty should resolve the long-standing dispute over the name of the country, as well as Skopje's path to NATO and the EU, reminds TASS.

U.S. is satisfied with the growth of opiate production in Afghanistan
The sharp escalation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 was much discussed in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations involving Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on Afghan territory militants unleashed a real terrorist war against the state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year was a record year in the number of bloody terrorist attacks, which killed thousands of ordinary Afghans",Patrushev said.
Afghanistan's troubles did not begin yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared a terrorist group "Al Qaeda" (banned in the Russian Federation), settled in Afghanistan.
Less than a month later, America and NATO allies launched Operation Enduring Freedom there.
Seventeen years have passed.
Thousands of American troops are still on Afghan soil.
And the peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
American troops are driven behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they buy off the militants for money if they are not touched.
The government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - the Taliban (banned in Russia).
Another 10% - for ISIS terrorists (banned in the Russian Federation).
But they are growing fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly what they failed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be comfortable with this.
It is also gratifying that the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased by at least 40 times over the 17 years of the American presence.
An enormous increase in the area sown with opium poppy and multi-billion dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on EU and NATO membership, provided the name of the country is changed.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbour to be called Macedonia as an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovski, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement Macedonia or Northern Macedonia gets the right to a better future, hope for social changes.
And Greece will entrench the right to its past.
There are no ideal agreements.
They arise from difficult compromises and cannot make absolutely everyone happy".
The ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are in favor of renaming the country.
Against - the conservative opposition and President Gheorghe Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetina Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it: "Many of those who do not like the agreement, believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, loss of sovereignty.
It is obvious that there are countries that would not like Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans".
FEI Dulgheri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choices Macedonia's citizens make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole".
