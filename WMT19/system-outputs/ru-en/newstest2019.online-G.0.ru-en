The writer's anger could not be avoided even by the security Service of Ukraine: having come there and heard the conversations of employees with each other in Russian, she caused a scandal and left, slamming the door.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly the theme of Russia in a negative way was practically absent
The head of the Federation Council Committee on international Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it can be a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric, to which we have almost become accustomed in recent years in relation to Russia, was now much more muted," - said the Senator in an interview published on Sunday "Rossiyskaya Gazeta".
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes "designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with Ebola, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this series, at least, in the statement of the group of Western countries, which in this regard was expressed quite unanimously".
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "the theme of Russia in a negative way was practically absent."
"If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of foreign Affairs of Germany, I now do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir was not exactly" - drew the attention of the politician, noting that Russia "was no longer a kind of wall, which is trained tennis ball strikes."
The head of the relevant Committee of the Federation Council does not exclude that this indicates a certain trend, which, in his opinion, "will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may fully manifest itself in a year, two, three."
"I do not exclude that the current session in some sense can be a turning point," Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how Russia manages to move forward in international Affairs with the connection."
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine yet, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," the parliamentarian added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is "an adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just a possible - an integral participant in the solution of global problems of our time."
"I would not like to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that we are somewhere passing the point where the movement will not be a movement backwards, it will be a movement forward," he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly], foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago, Russian opinion, Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, no one was interested, now the situation is different," - said the Chairman of the Federation Council Committee.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which is personified with the West, has no answers to the questions of how to solve the world's problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, lack of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problem of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problem of migration."
"And here the request for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that he believes in this sense, "the current session is successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia."

ADH became the second most popular in Germany
Anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" beats another record of popularity, and the ratings of Angela Merkel fall.
Apparently, the people of Germany began to get seriously tired of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, thanks to which the country has become a coveted target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most clearly this is evidenced by the latest polls, according to which the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" is becoming more popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, ADH broke another record, rising to the second place in the ranking of people's sympathies.
Right-wing conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to bypass the social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to a statistical error, but it should be noted that the ADG created in 2013 from a small group of eurosceptic economists managed to turn into a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall standings continues to hold the ruling bloc of the CSU/CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - in April, the support of Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
Reduced and personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term.
Today, in support of Angela Merkel are 48 percent of Germans, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
We add that after the social Democrats are "green" (15%), the left (11%) and the liberals (10%).
Evolution "Alternatives"
The alternative for Germany party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the alternative choice 2013 group, which included people from the Christian democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government's course, but initially dealt only with economic issues, including the problems of the Euro and cooperation within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of the weak economies of the EU, did not exclude the possibility of a return to the German mark and a full exit of the country from the European Union.
Amid deepening immigration crisis, the political platform of ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party, which took a niche of eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, ADH managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the "Alternative for Germany" get a seat in the European Parliament.

Named the time of death of the Universe
The universe will exist for another 140 billion years, ten times the age of the observed world, which is about 13.8 billion years.
The study of the international team of scientists posted in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and aimed at publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, according to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
To such conclusions, experts have come, watching with the camera HSC (Hyper Supreme-Cam) telescope Subaru for about ten million galaxies.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-the mass of the observed world, scientists working within the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Cold Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the Universe, which was a little slower than previously thought.
In a press release of the Subaru Observatory it is noted that the observations made it possible to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the data of the European space telescope Planck specified the restrictions imposed on the parameters ΛCDM.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the Universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of a Large gap.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
The opportunity to learn the opinion of the people about the pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the Federal initiative group of the referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that registered different formulations of questions (in total, the Central election Commission registered five formulations).

This formulation was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and legally capacious.
The majority of the meeting participants were supporters of Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist party (four subgroups), a member of Just Russia.
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.

In a match "Loko" - "Ahmad" error Turbine fell like a horn of plenty
The former judge of the all-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship Lokomotiv - Akhmat and reviewed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How can you estimate refereeing Eugene Turbine in the match "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmad"?
- I believe that this referee has confirmed his unfitness for judging the matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the pressure in the meeting of the fifth round of "Spartak" - "Dynamo", neither Turbin nor the leaders of the DSI did not make serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result was not slow to affect in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private omissions of rough receptions fell as from a cornucopia.
For example, at the 50th minute of the railroad Eder floods with his hands in his own penalty area, the defender "Akhmad" ELISA.
From the gate of eight meters, but Turbine doesn't award a penalty.
- How do you assess the episode with Idov, who was on the 82nd minute, when it seemed that the ball hit him in the hand?
- I believe that there was a deliberate play by the defender's hand in his penalty area.
Turbin was near the moment, well sees this episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment had to be seen also by the reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three of them slept, and the penalty was not awarded.
Therefore, the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice was trampled.
This was the case when judging by the concepts supplanted and buried the sports spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute, Turbine decided not to remove the defender of the guests, Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight against Krychowiak, and when the referee showed him a yellow card and demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think about this episode?
It was necessary to show the second yellow card?
- At this point the Turbines and the first yellow card shown is not quite the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of refereeing that some teams get a penalty for such violations as in the episode with Idov, and some do not.
What do you evaluate the words of a football player?
- Depends what you mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't.
So, the referee does not give a second penalty to the opposite goal.
Here is the principle that is used.
And the second point of the double standards that the judge looks at who's playing.
Played here on Saturday "the locomotive" and "Ahmad" there are serious claims to work of the Turbine, because the team was slighted.
Matt Damon played accused of rape judge Cavanaugh at the start of SNL
American actor Matt Damon played us Supreme court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at a Senate hearing on rape charges.
Candidate to the US Supreme court has previously attracted attention with its emotion and detail in his stories during the conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
Thus, Cavanaugh has repeatedly admitted his love of beer, but said that he had never drunk to unconsciousness.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Cavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
These moments also beat Damon.

I was the proudest, drunkest virgin anyone had ever seen.
Everyone knows it," said the judge in the performance of Matt Damon.
Previously, Cavanaugh was elected chief judge of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found her cloned dogs strange behavior
American singer Barbra Streisand said that clones of her dead dog behave quite differently than the original pet.
"They don't.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul," - said the 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old Coton de tulear dog named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep because of health problems.
In July 2018,it was reported that the dog breed Chihuahua named Miracle Milli (Miracle Milly), which was called the smallest dog in the world, cloned for the 49th time.

The US thought about the naval blockade of Russia because of oil and gas supplies
The United States may begin a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The American authorities are so zealously engaged in the struggle for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main suppliers of energy.
On the possibility of a naval blockade on the eve told the interior Minister Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to world practice, the American Ministry of the interior does not perform police and civil functions, including the implementation of policies in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke's statement came quite within the competence of the Department headed by him, although it was not devoid of political overtones.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the naval forces of the United States control sea routes in the middle East region and can block them if necessary.
From zinke's words it followed that the need may be related to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from the supply of oil and gas to the world market.

Expensive violin was pawned for a song
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in Somerville, Massachusetts, a pawnshop worker offered only $ 50 for an old-looking and unpresentable instrument.
But an experienced store Manager Dylan Mcdermitt suspected that this is an old and expensive tool, and asked for advice from an expert.
Then it turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at 250 thousand dollars.
Only bows the violin is estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin was not so long ago stolen from one of the city's residents, and the tool returned to the rightful owner.

And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should cause me to understand more than any other participant with real vocal abilities.

And then we all complain about the same faces on stage and on screen for decades!
Yes because not cut through nepotism!"

It's Russia!

I found myself in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We hoped that after the others would stop at the pit stop, we would get into the "clean air", and return the pace, but the rubber was gone.

President of the tennis Federation of Russia (FTR) Shamil Tarpischev commented on the suspension of players of the Moscow "Spartak" Denis Glushakov and Andrei Eschenko from training with the main team after Laika to criticize the head coach of the team Massimo Carrera, reports "Sport weekend".
Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is utter stupidity.
I totally disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It only deepens the discord in the team.
First, it is poetry, to read and to perceive them as you like.
I wouldn't react to that if I were Carrera.
Everyone has an opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to be buried.
If Glushakov and Eschenko put likes, it does not mean that they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks flexibility in his perception of the situation.
And it does not serve the normal climate in the team.
Today, Spartak did not have a game, so this situation did not need to be inflated at all.
Maybe we should have laughed about it together.
"Spartak" has a lot of things not in order in different lines, there is a lack of play after the introduction of the youth.
Relations within the team, apparently, do not add optimism before this match," - said Tarpischev.
The game of the two teams will take place on September 30 and will start at 19.00 Moscow time.

The development of technologies that resemble natural ones in fact there is a technological reproduction of the systems of nature.
There is a downside - purposeful intervention in human activity.
There are always risks.
There was a car - people began to die under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of the technology immediately.
I create a new medical technology, and at the same time can create weapons of mass destruction", - quotes the scientist REN TV.

For people outraged by a flock of sheep in the cemetery
On September 30 on the known Kemerovo page on a social network there was a message from the eyewitness that on one of local cemeteries horned animals freely walk about.
Animals a considerable herd walked between the fence and plucked the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: some of the locals noted that in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery there is no harm, and their appetite can even help in clearing the area of weeds and grass, but some of the residents of the animal behavior did not have to like:
"These are graves , not pasture.
Sheep have nothing to do there.
About sheep, of course you will not say that they blaspheme, but still it is not the case." (style is kept) - the indignant Kemerovo woman noted in the message.
Anyway, someone from eyewitnesses noted that about a problem in the form of animals in the middle of a cemetery it is already known, and soon necessary measures will be taken.
Press and dominate - how right?
There is no word for pressure.
Right - to cling to.
The word "press" in the sense of "to weigh, to influence, to influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "to dominate".
We use this word, believing that it comes from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "dominate" etymologically are not only not close, but even in some sense opposite.
See for yourself.
To dominate (Church.-bookish, outdated) - means "enough, full, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something to satisfy."
To be content, pleasure - related words.
Previously, it still had the meaning of "do not depend on anything, have a self-sufficient value" - "to dominate yourself."
Old Church Slavonic "doville" related words "command" and "will".
Press, suppress - completely different.
These words are really frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (crushing sheep), deyja - "die" and dvaidī - "oppress".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "dominate", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
So we have this very "d[a]vlet", which is used in writing through "a", which, in a good way, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of occurrence and development of these words.
So, the right - to cling to.
But this word is outdated, in its correct meaning is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word "push".
You can also use the "apply pressure" design, but remember that this is a stationery.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the UOC with the actions of fascists
The head of the Synodal Department for external Church relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It's like in Nazi Germany to put a yellow pointed star on a Jew, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and for this purpose this bill was created," the Metropolitan said on the TV channel "Russia-24" (quote from "Interfax").
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and "put it outside the law," the priest believes.
"This is the Ukrainian Church, and the believers of this Church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country," he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills №4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), №4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and №5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).

Given the situation that has developed, and according to the information that we have, and the threats of violence, which is spreading, it is clear that we will have to go through something," - said the Metropolitan.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
Also, the vicar said that probably "need your physical presence."
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren - in spirit, threaten with violence, and therefore protect their Shrine."
Who cares about the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrines, we must be ready to protect it, the address says.
Metropolitan urged not to go on about those who mislead believers.
The UOC has a canonical status determined by Tomos on October 29, 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to make dependent on the news Patriarch and a friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our Church has," said the vicar of the Lavra.
He recalled that the UOC has been canonically independent and fully independent in its management since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, our Church already has Tomos.
What other Tomos do we need?"- said Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochaev, calling the faithful and all citizens to wonder whether other religions Tomos, whether they are independent from the Vatican?
Believers in some measure understood and decided in what temple they go.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and discord again.
Some are seized with envy that Shine domes on the temples that they want to destroy," - said the priest.
Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
Lavra is located on the top of Pochaev mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.

U.S. satisfied with the growth of opiate production in Afghanistan
Tehran talked a lot about the sharp aggravation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26.
There were multilateral consultations with Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, the militants unleashed a real terrorist war against the state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year was a record in the number of bloody terrorist attacks, which killed thousands of ordinary Afghans," Patrushev said.
The troubles in Afghanistan did not start yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared a terrorist group "al-Qaeda" (banned in Russia), entrenched in Afghanistan.
Less than a month, as America and NATO allies began there military operation "enduring freedom".
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of American troops are still on Afghan soil.
And peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
American troops are driven behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As can, pay off fighters for money - if only they weren't touched.
The government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - the Taliban (banned in Russia).
Another 10% - for ISIS terrorists (banned in Russia).
But they grow fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-Caliphate in Central Asia - exactly the one that they failed in Iraq and Syria.
America, apparently, is satisfied.
How happy that in 17 years the American presence and the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased by at least 40 times.
Huge growth of the areas sown with opium poppy and multibillion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its Northern neighbor's right to be called Macedonia, seeing in this name an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia gets the right to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will consolidate the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of a difficult compromise can not bring happiness to absolutely everyone."
For renaming the country are the ruling social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against - the conservative opposition and President George Ivanov.
According to the journalist Cvetin Filimonova, Macedonia makes no sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement, believe that the current socialist government headed by Sevim imposed from the outside to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
Euronews: "the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that Macedonian citizens will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole."
