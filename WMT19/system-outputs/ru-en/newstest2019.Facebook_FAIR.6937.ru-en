The number of recruits from Ukraine preparing to be sent to Donbas has been named
The official representative of the People's Police of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), Andrei Marochko, said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine will send no less than 3,000 new recruits to Donbas.
According to him, in this way Kiev plans to "at least in some way complete the units".
"The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass dismissals have led to low staffing of the units", Marochko said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real figures of Ukrainians conscripted into the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched a so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by a joint force operation (JF).
It was supposed that this measure would strengthen the role of Ukrainian security forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbas escalated because of the assassination of the head of the DPR, Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DNR authorities qualified what happened as a terrorist attack.
In the course of the criminal investigation, several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by the Ukrainian special services.

To settle claims from the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the entrepreneur will also pay $20 million

It is specified that the arrangement has yet to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it was revealed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Musk of misleading shareholders by claiming that there were sufficient funds to buy back the company's shares, and sued the entrepreneur.

After the tweet, the company's shares rose nearly 11%.
British Foreign Office chief compares EU to Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of taking member states prisoner.
The diplomat made this statement at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As the Daily Mail notes, Hunt has thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
Whatever happened to the belief in and ideals of the European dream?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not let anyone leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who will want to escape from captivity, "declared the Minister.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave the European Union will only exacerbate the crisis, Gazeta.ru notes.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that the Brexit negotiations had reached an impasse.
This is how she commented on the outcome of the informal EU summit in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was made in 2016 following a referendum.
The United Kingdom's exit is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the question of the Irish border remains open.

Telegram users have complained about the malfunction of the new version
iPhone users complained about problems with the messaging service Telegram after the update, released on September 28.
You can find out the phone number of the user by his username
The complaints concern gadgets with the up-to-date operating system iOS 12.
According to their owners, after the update, the app shows a white screen or closes immediately.
Messenger representatives reacted to the glitch.
According to them, the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new app written in the Swift language.
Telegram has temporarily suspended the automatic update of the app until the problems are fixed.
On April 13, the Tagansky Court of Moscow granted Roskomnadzor's claim to block the Telegram messenger in Russia.
Three days later, the telecom operators began enforcing the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the messenger administration to provide the FSB with the keys for the decryption of correspondence needed to obtain data about terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a suspected terrorist user when a court order is obtained.
The audience of Telegram after the blocking in Russia decreased by 1.2 million

Elon Musk forced to resign as head of Tesla board
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their dispute over fraud.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the channel, as part of the agreements reached, Musk will have to step down as head of Tesla's board of directors.
In doing so, the commission allowed Musk to retain his position as Tesla's chief executive.
As noted, the Tesla founder will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million
A similar amount will be recovered from Tesla.
At the same time, the money will be distributed among affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur listed as one of the 50 richest people on the planet by Forbes magazine.
He is the chief executive of space corporation SpaceX, neurotech company Neuralink and electric car developer Tesla, as well as a co-founder of Paypal.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission had previously sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk over his tweet about a possible buyout of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy back all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The share price of $420 was set allegedly "because of the significance of this number in the marijuana culture", Bloomberg reported earlier, citing the commission's co-director of security, Stephen Peikin.
Meanwhile, Elon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy back the shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said that he believes the allegations of fraud are unfounded, and added that he is very disappointed and saddened by the claims.
"Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I did not violate it in any way", the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
Meanwhile, in August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a class-action lawsuit against Musk, complaining about the financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts brought them losses.
In particular, one shareholder claimed that the businessman's tweets were misleading, which forced sellers of Tesla shares to buy paper at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that Elon Musk's careless remarks led to sharp fluctuations in the rate.
In September, Elon Musk was also accused of stock market manipulation by the head of research company Citron Research.
Meanwhile, if Musk had failed to settle his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would have faced removal from the company's leadership and even jail.
Former Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt, among others, told CNBC.
Musk is "not a bad guy who doesn't know how to run a car company".

The ROC compared the possible renaming of the UOC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Department for External Church Relations (DECR) of the Moscow Patriarchate, Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk, compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church into the Russian Church in Ukraine to the actions of fascists in Germany.
Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk - on the causes of the conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the possible Church schism and its political subtext
According to him, now that "the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at an acute stage", renaming the church is like giving "the Jews a yellow six-pointed star" in fascist Germany.
"This means labeling the church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created", a representative of the ROC said on Rossiya 24 television.
The Metropolitan also stressed that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, because "the faithful of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country".
The UOC called on the Constantinople exarchs to leave its territory
Grand Prix in Sochi: full house, Russian car and Kvyat's return
Within the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing car.
This was stated by Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Kozak summarizing the results of a meeting with Russian automakers on the eve of the start of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
Also, the Deputy Prime Minister shared his opinion on the return of Daniil Kvyat to Toro Rosso and estimated the attendance of the Russian stage of Formula One.
The result of our meeting with car manufacturers should be, in the foreseeable future, the creation of a Russian Formula One car, which has no analogues in the world, said Dmitry Kozak.
We need to stimulate our automakers in this direction.
It was about plans until 2024, but I don't think that is possible in such a time frame.
I think a more realistic time frame is within the next ten years". 
From 2012 to 2014, the Marusya team performed under a Russian license in Formula One.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there are already investors ready to invest in the creation of a domestic team in the world championship in motor racing in the Formula One class.
I know that in Russia there are fans of motor sports, wealthy businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of a Russian Formula One team, "he noted.
"We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we have such a team.
I suspect that the intention to create a team came about partly because such infrastructure appeared in Sochi". 
Tomorrow, "Sochi Avtodrom" expects a full house.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50 thousand tickets.
Look, even in qualifying, the grandstands were practically full, - noted the Deputy Prime Minister.
I can say that revenue this year has grown by 72% compared to last year.
This is a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the efficiency of the use of Sochi Avtodrom's infrastructure throughout the year.
It will be an additional tourist product that will add even more appeal to Sochi.
Nor did Dmitry Kozak avoid the main topic of the day for Russian motorsport fans - the return of Daniil Kvyat to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel together and wish him success in the next season, - said the Deputy Prime Minister to "News".
He is a promising racing driver.
Next year, for the first time in history, two main Russian drivers will be able to take part in the Formula One peloton at once.
Although the future fate of Sergei Sirotkin in the "Royal Race" remains unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results so far have not been impressive: he finished 18th in qualifying for the Russian Grand Prix.
Let's hope that next season there will be more of our main pilots than this year, - stated Dmitry Kozak.

On September 30, 1928, that is, exactly 90 years ago, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming worldwide fame, and made him a Nobel laureate.
By the way, the release of penicillin from mold fungi was not Fleming's first discovery.
A few years earlier, when he had a cold, he sowed mucus from his own nose on a petri dish (the kind of glass lid in which bacteria are tested) and a few days later found that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
Almost by accident, he discovered penicillin as well.
Fleming's name was added to a list of the 100 most distinguished individuals in human history.
His discovery, according to many scientists, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to cope with most of the most ancient diseases, previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after winning the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, Paris newspapers wrote: "He did more than dozens of divisions to defeat fascism and liberate France".
Experts estimate that Fleming's discovery of the world's first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million Earth's inhabitants.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 of a heart attack.
He was cremated and, a week later, his ashes were buried in London's famous St Paul's Cathedral.
Where, by the way, my wife and I drew attention to this by a word-hungry Russian-speaking tour guide.
And a few years later, we saw the full-length statue of Alexander Fleming in the most unexpected place in Spain's capital.
There, next to the main bullfighting arena of the Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, Spain's most famous matadors erected a monument to the man whose efforts saved, in their opinion, the lives of hundreds of outstanding bullfighting masters.
By the way, this, in my opinion, quite interesting porcelain work was found by me there, in Madrid, but at a different time and not on this occasion at all.

Trump talks about 'falling in love' with Kim Jong-un
The US and North Korean leaders went from mutual cruelty to almost falling in love with each other, Donald Trump has joked.
US President Donald Trump made a good joke about his successes on the North Korean crisis front.
Starting with mutual threats of annihilation, the two leaders have now mended their relationship to such an extent that they are almost in love with each other, the American president noted.
The White House host recalled that he had accepted from the previous administration the North Korea issue as a major foreign policy challenge.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had so launched relations with North Korea that they couldn't even call the country's leaders - they simply didn't take the phone off.
Back then, the US and North Korea were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader is writing "beautiful letters" to the White House, Trump noted.
Trump admitted that he, too, was "cruel" to Kim Jong-un at the beginning of his tenure, though it was mutual.
Now, however, their relationship has improved so much that the leaders "fell in love with each other".
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the US media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump pointed out that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests, and is also closing military test sites.
All this is a credit to the work of his administration, the American president is confident.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump flattering Kim Jong-un from the podium of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that sanctions against North Korea will remain in place until the Korean Peninsula is fully denuclearized.

Meanwhile, other practical steps toward North Korea's denuclearization have so far stalled.
Media reported that after the Singapore summit, the US had already sent North Korea several disarmament scenarios, but Pyongyang rejected them as "gangster".

Nice urged to supplant "the Moscow language with a Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of the native language Larisa Nitsoy called for the "Russian-language Moscow product and the Moscow language" to be displaced from Ukraine.
She offers to do this with a Ukrainian product - "a cultural wave, a cultural onslaught".
Nitsoy shared her thoughts on the "expediency of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian edition of the Observer.
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language", she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said, in the past, Russian speech was widely used on television and radio, but there was virtually no Russian speech left in public space.
At the same time, according to Nitsoy, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "an extension of the boundaries for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level".
Earlier, Nitsoy shared her experience of maintaining a "Ukrainian-speaking regime" at a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened legal action against bookstore chain Watsons, the cashier of one of which communicated with her in Russian.
Having failed to achieve her goal, Nitsoy threw the surrender at the girl.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians "linguistic schizophrenia", calling on Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the spelling of family names.
Recently, Nitsoy claimed that the name "Rus" had been stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscovia.
The writer's anger could not be avoided even by the Security Service of Ukraine: when she came there and heard the employees talking to each other in Russian, she caused a scandal and left, slamming the door.

"Such a difficult game turned out, during the break we had a serious men's conversation, and it paid off: we scored two goals and didn't miss.
"You missed a few matches because of the injury you suffered at the beginning of the month.
How did I feel today? "
"If I withstood 90 minutes, then everything is good!
In fact, it felt good.
Maybe there was a little bit of strength in the end so that nothing would happen.
And so, the doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev brought me to this game, for which I thank them very much!
"What do you say about the atmosphere in the team?"
"It is no secret that after victories and it is easier to recover, and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white band, even though at first it was black.
It is necessary to continue in the same spirit and to please fans". 
"Did I miss the game during the time I didn't go out on the pitch?"
"There is such a thing, a little bit bored, because really, the unpleasant situation has come out.
But once again, thank you to the physiotherapist and the doctors for putting me on my feet.
The most important thing is that we won and pleased the fans.
And the rest is all secondary".

The indictment for the Dagestan deputy became news
The Soviet District Court of Makhachkala has detained for two months a deputy of the People's Assembly of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, suspected of participating in a criminal association that registered a disability for bribes.
Kommersant has learned details of the investigation materials that shed light on exactly how, according to the Investigative Committee of Russia, the younger brother of the former head of the republic, Ramazan Abdulatipov, Rajab Abdulatipov, facilitated the criminal actions of the now former head of the Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise, Magomed Makhachev, and his accomplices.
Among other things, in the course of operational and search activities conducted by employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was established that Rajab Abdulatipov lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Makhachev to the post of head of the bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles for it.
Earlier, the investigation against Magomed Makhachev, other heads and employees of the territorial bureaus of medical and social expertise under his authority, initiated a criminal case under Article 210 (creation of a criminal association using official position and participation in it), Article 290 (taking bribes by an organized group), Article 292 (official forgery), and Article 159 (fraud on a particularly large scale) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
As follows from the investigation materials, at the end of 2013, Rajab Abdulatipov, knowing about the illegal actions of Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices, who were engaged in the theft of Pension Fund funds, joined their activities by joining a criminal association.
While serving as the head of the Department of the Federal Migration Service of Russia for Dagestan and having ties to state authorities and law enforcement agencies, as well as taking advantage of his relationship with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, according to investigators, "provided for the activities of other members of the criminal association, established contacts with officials of state bodies to support the illegal activities of Magomed Makhachev and his tenure as head of the federal state institution" Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise for the Republic of Dagestan, "organized the illegal establishment of disabilities to citizens".
After the announcement of this information at a meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov denied the charges against him.
"Of course, everything that is being accused of me today is new to me, absolutely I am not familiar with it", he said.
The court arrested the deputy from United Russia not for ten days before the indictment, as was the case with previous high-ranking Dagestan officials, but for two months at a time, because his case involves Article 210 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, the investigation has much longer time to bring charges - up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

The Serbian leader made the relevant statement during a press conference, reports the local newspaper Vecherniye Novosti.
According to the source, the head of Serbia specified that, when speaking about the need for support from the Russian side, he does not mean military support following the example of Syria.
Aleksandar Vucic stated that he does not want to allow a scenario in which some major military clashes could occur on the territory of the state.
The President of the country promised to make maximum efforts to preserve peace, the publication reports.
Add that, according to information from Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for the coming Tuesday, October 2, writes "Lenta.ru".
A day earlier, it was reported that the Serbian president had put the state's army on full alert because of the situation with Kosovo.
This is about the events of last Friday, when several dozen Kosovo special forces entered the territory adjacent to the lake that supplies water to the Gazivode hydroelectric power plant.
It is specified that this hydropower plant is located on the territory of Kosovo, but at the same time belongs to the Serbian power grid.
Recall that Kosovo declared independence from Serbia a decade ago, however, Belgrade refused to recognize this fact.
Last spring, the parties stopped negotiating on this issue.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, Russia was practically absent in a negative way
Head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly a success for Russia and does not rule out that it could become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in the solution of global world problems.
"The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my opinion, lies in the fact that the rhetoric to which we have become almost accustomed in recent years regarding Russia has now been an order of magnitude more muted", the senator said in an interview published Sunday by Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
He explained that in previous years, Russia was sometimes "designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, then along with Ebola, then along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, at least in the narrative of a group of Western countries, which was quite unanimous in this regard".
At the 73rd session, Kosachev emphasized, "the topic of Russia in a negative way was practically absent".
"If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not now take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at any rate, the chorus was not absolutely accurate", the politician noted, noting that Russia "was no longer some kind of wall against which tennis ball blows are trained".
The head of the relevant committee of the Security Council does not rule out that this indicates a certain trend, which, in his opinion, "will single out the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although the full extent of this trend will probably emerge in a year, two, three years".
"I do not rule out that the current session may in some sense be a turning point", Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how, with Russia's involvement, we manage to move forward in international affairs".
As an example, he cited the situations in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"So far, unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time", the parliamentarian added.
This is because, he believes, there is an "adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just possible - an integral participant in the solution of the global problems of our time".
"I don't want to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that somewhere we are passing a point beyond which the movement will no longer be a movement backwards, it will be a movement forward", he added.
Kosachev called another "interesting and important feeling" in this context "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop".
"I attended a lot of meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly], Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if only a year or two or five years ago no one was interested in Russian opinion, Russian vision of what is happening in the world, now the situation is different", stated the Chairman of the Committee of the Council of Fed.
According to him, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which is personified with the West, has no answers to the questions of how to solve the world's problems because of the obvious shortage of ideas in the global space, the shortage of ideas about how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of nuclear non-proliferation, the problems of migration".
"And here the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious", Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that he considers in this sense "the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia".

Damascus says it has the right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that military force will not have to be used in the Syrian province of Idlib, said Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem.
At the same time, he said, Syria is entitled to it.
The minister added that Turkey has an opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of the withdrawal of fighters from the Russian-banned Jabhat al-Nusra organization from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, RIA Novosti reports.
The Foreign Minister also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories to the east of the Euphrates in the event of Kurdish aspirations for separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, negotiations with the Kurdish SDF forces were good, until they broke down because of the US.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdogan agreed to create, by October 15, a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in Syria's Idlib province.
Terry took charge of Chelsea's youth team
Earlier it was reported that the 37-year-old defender was in talks over a move to Spartak Moscow.
According to RT, with reference to the Mirror, former England captain John Terry headed the Chelsea youth team.
According to the source, the well-known player, who has long been a part of the London club, will manage the team no older than 23 years.

First Deputy Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada Irina Gerashchenko apologized to the Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushchenko, who had been convicted in the Russian Federation for "espionage", for the fact that he had still not been released from detention.
She said this in a video message to a political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of Sushchenko's illegal arrest by the FSB.
According to her, these days, an action is taking place under the walls of the Russian embassy in Paris, the participants of which have announced a hunger protest demanding the release of prisoners of the Kremlin.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, including people who know you well, go hungry, supporting Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and, of course, you.
There is not a single international meeting, not a single negotiation, not a single interview, where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand to exert pressure on the Kremlin, to exert pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those guys who are being illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbas and Crimea, "Gerashchenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the tests will temper every Ukrainian, making us "angrier, tougher in protecting Ukraine's national interests, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil".
Recall that the correspondent of Ukrinform in France, Roman Sushchenko, was detained by Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 at the Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with spying on the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a strict regime penal colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia declared this verdict lawful.
Russian jailers granted the Ukrainian's last request before his transfer to the colony.

"I couldn't even hold a spoon"
Vakhtang Kikabidze on the fight against cancer
Now many artists are talking about how they have managed to cope with cancer.
The disease, unfortunately, spares no one, and popular people's stories of victories over cancer give hope to many sufferers.
The well-known actor Vakhtang Kikabidze admitted that he is alive only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was given a terrible diagnosis that sounded like a verdict.
"I was kind of hit on the skull with a hammer from below.
I fell.
Lost his orientation.
They put him in a hospital.
I couldn't hold a spoon there, I couldn't stand up, I was falling all the time.
They started to do tests, it turned out that things were bad, the artery didn't allow blood to pass.
They brought me to Moscow, where they told me that I had a large purulent cyst in my head, and they urgently performed surgery.
And during the surgery, doctors behind the cyst saw a tumor, "Kikabidze said in the program" Once". 
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, residents of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to their idol on the doorstep of his house.
But the actor's wife did not allow the live actor to be buried, she saintly believed that she could cope with the disease and did not leave the bed of her beloved husband for more than a year.
If it hadn't been for Irina, I wouldn't be alive now.
Always when I had critical situations, she was there like a rock, "the actor admitted.
The actor has managed to cope with the disease, and now lives happily in his home in central Tbilisi.
And, from time to time, he denies rumors of his illness or untimely death, which repeatedly appear on the Web.
The creators of the "Peacemaker" site have added Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto to the "Purgatory" section.
The occasion was "an attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine".
In addition, the head of the Foreign Ministry of the neighboring country was found guilty of "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine", as well as of participating "in the organization of provocation aimed at mass violation of Ukrainian legislation by citizens of Ukraine".
It should be noted that before Szijjarto, the vicar of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, Pavel, and the primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate), Onufry, pleased in the "Purgatory".
The occasion was their opposition to the acquisition of Tomos by the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Transcarpathia, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for Ukraine's sovereign rights.
The authorities named the amount of the "golden parachute" of the Voronezh deputy governor
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronezh Region, Yuri Agibalov, was made on the basis of the regional law "On public positions".
At the same time, the real amount of the "golden parachute" released from the post of acting official was several times less than the amount announced in the media.
Such explanations were provided to the press service of the regional government.
According to the law, the salary for the position Agibalov holds is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, the press service emphasized, the size of the lump-sum payment amounted to 223,892 roubles net of income tax, not the 1 million roubles reported by the media.
The official had been receiving an old-age insurance pension since July 2018.
His record in public office is more than nine years.
The appointment of this pension and lump-sum payment to him is made immediately after his dismissal from his post, the regional government explained to RIA Novosti agency.
At the same time, payment of an additional pension to Agibalov was suspended upon appointment to a state post, and the size of his salary did not change in comparison with the previous period.
Alexander Gusev, the acting governor of the region, who won the governor's election, took office on September 15.
Agibalov was relieved of his post in connection with the expiration of the term of office of the acting head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public office in the region have ended.
On September 29, Telegram-channel "Nezygar" published documents, from which it appeared that Agibalov, who resigned from the post of vice-governor, was paid severance pay in the amount of 23 salaries, and two days after that he again received a similar post without the prefix "acting".
State Duma deputy urged to tell schoolchildren about the harm of masturbation
Onishchenko holds the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on his work experience, he noted in an interview that teenagers are provoked to masturbate by harmful information they find on the Internet.
It is worth fighting this at the level of educational institutions and the family, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, Deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Says Moscow":
As part of general sex education for children, this needs to be done by explaining the harm, because there is a risk to the sexual health of the child, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it is that the maturation of children comes early enough, and then there are large scissors between their puberty and the possibility of officially having intersex contacts.
According to Onishchenko, the solution to the problem is hampered by "bigotry", silence about "problems of sexual age", and the absence of a culture of adequate child-rearing.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers are confronted with onanism.
The deputy believes that it is primarily worth practicing lessons about the harm of onism in the schools of "hyperurbanized" regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, we will simply not be understood with you, to put it mildly", the professor said.
Gennady Onishchenko is a current academician of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, member of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, doctor of medical sciences, professor.
Honored doctor of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the Presidium of the all-Russian public organization "League of Health of the Nation".

AfD becomes second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany is breaking another popularity record, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
Apparently, Germans have begun to tire seriously of Angela Merkel's immigration policies, which have made the country a coveted target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Nowhere is this more evident than in recent opinion polls, according to which the anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party is becoming increasingly popular and the positions of Merkel and Seehofer's ruling bloc are weakening.
This week, the AfD broke another record, rising to second place in the popular sympathy rankings.
The right-wing conservatives, with 17 percent popularity, have managed to beat the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The one-percentage-point gap can be attributed to statistical error, but the fact that the AfD, created in 2013 from a small group of Euroskeptic economists, has managed to become a serious political force cannot be ignored.
The overall lead is still held by the ruling CSU / CDU bloc, which has about 30 percent.
But there is a tendency to lose points here - back in April, support for Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who heads Germany's government for a fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans back Angela Merkel, down 7 percentage points from last year.
Add that the Social Democrats were followed by the Greens (15%), the Left (11%), and the Liberals (10%).
The evolution of the "Alternative"
The Alternative für Deutschland party was founded in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which includes people from the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government's course, but initially focused only on economic issues, including the euro and interaction within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of weak EU economies, did not rule out the possibility of a return to the deutsche mark and a full exit from the European Union.
With the immigration crisis deepening, the AfD's political platform has broadened.
In 2013, the group emerged as a full-fledged party that took on a Euroskeptic niche and began harshly criticizing the government for its failed immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary election in 2017, the AfD managed to make its way into the Bundestag for the first time, gaining 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the Alternative for Germany will win seats in the European Parliament.
A video of a journalist calling citizens of Ukraine a "nation of bollocks" has been published
The host of a political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books, Ostap Drozdov, admitted live on air that he considers his compatriots to be a "nation of bollocks".
They believe TV and don't read much.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We have not been instilled with a culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood", the journalist stated.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov's words, accusing him of a lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio Broadcasting of Nezalezhnaya has begun to combat literature that contains the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of as many as 201 editions.

Canadians created car in case of apocalypse - Behind the wheel magazine
Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions has said that it is already accepting applications for its new armoured vehicle.
The Apocalypse Armor Roshel Senator APC
On the theme of the apocalypse, it is not just video game manufacturers, film studios, and book publishers that make money.
Now car companies are also developing a new niche for themselves.
For example, Canada's Roshel Defense Solutions has unveiled its Senator APC armored apocalypse vehicle.
In their spare time, engineers from this company create armored vehicles for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are accommodated in an all-welded armor capsule without much comfort, but in complete safety.
This bunker, or else the structure cannot be called, as its booking level corresponds to the B7 standard, is mounted on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armoured, is capable of protecting the capsule from grenades and anti-personnel mines.
The interior of the Roshel Senator APC armoured vehicle
In order for passengers not to be harmed even by an explosive wave from a shell that exploded next to the car, the interior of the car is equipped with special shock absorbing seats.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire extinguishing system.
For safe viewing, the Roshel Senator APC vehicle is equipped with a 360-degree camera system with night vision function, as well as an armoured observation tower on the roof.
There are no weapons in the vehicle.
The front of the interior of the Roshel Senator APC armoured vehicle
To ensure that the heavy weight of the armoured vehicle does not affect its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-horsepower 6.7-litre turbodiesel engine, the full power of which is transmitted to the four wheels of the armoured vehicle through a 6-speed automatic transmission.
No chance of getting stuck at all in Roshel Senator APC apocalypse armor
An armored vehicle of the Roshel Senator APC apocalypse can be seen at a specialized exhibition in Washington in October.
Term of Death of the Universe Named
The universe will survive for another 140 billion years or so, which is ten times the age of the observed world of about 13.8 billion years.
The research of an international team of scientists has been posted in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is aimed at publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts reached similar conclusions by observing about ten million galaxies with the Subaru telescope's HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam).
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observed world, the scientists, working within the standard cosmological model known as Cold Dark Matter, estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously thought.
The Subaru Observatory said in a press release that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and data from the European Planck space telescope clarified the limitations imposed on the CDM parameters.
In July, scientists simulated the possible demise of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Gap.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum fails
Opportunity to find out people's opinion on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the all-federal initiative group of the referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that registered different formulations of the questions (in total, the Central Election Commission registered five formulations).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a request to register a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Are you in favor of not raising the age set by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, at which Russian citizens are entitled to old-age pensions?"
This formulation was registered by the Vologda sub-group, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered to be the simplest and legally capacious.
The majority of participants in the meeting were supporters of Just Russia member Ilya Sviridov (six sub-groups) and the Communist Party (four sub-groups).
They were joined by three independent sub-groups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that invitations had been sent to all the initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups had expressed their agreement to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda sub-group (its wording was supported by 15 other sub-groups), told Vedomosti that she had not received an invitation and had not planned to come: "We did not understand who is a friend and who is an enemy".

'It wasn't an easy game, it was a difficult game.
The rival fought with dignity, created big problems for us.

In the Loko-Akhmat match, Turbin's mistakes poured down like a cornucopia
Former All-Union referee Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Lokomotiv" - "Akhmat" and dissected the disputed episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the refereeing of Evgeny Turbin in the Lokomotiv-Akhmat match?
- I believe that this referee has confirmed his unfitness to referee matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the pressure in the meeting of the fifth round "Spartak" - "Dynamo", neither Turbin himself nor the heads of the DSI have drawn serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private passes of rough receptions rained down as if from a horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute, the railway worker Eder is felled with his hands in his penalty area by the defender "Ahmat" Rodolfo.
Eight yards from goal, but Turbin doesn't put a penalty away.
- How do you assess the episode involving Idowu, which was in the 82nd minute, when it seemed that the ball hit him in the hand?
- I believe that here was a deliberate play by the defender's hand in his penalty area.
Turbin was close to the moment, sees the episode well and his first assistant on the right.
Reserve referee Sergei Karasev should have seen this moment as well.
Nevertheless, all three slept, and no penalty was awarded.
So the score in the match is skewed, and sporting justice has been trampled.
It was the same case where refereeing by definition supplanted and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute, Turbin did not dare to remove the defender of the guests, Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight with Krykhovyak, and when the referee showed him a yellow card, demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think about this episode?
Was it necessary to show the second "mustard"?
- At this point Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite on the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of refereeing that some teams are given a penalty for such violations, as in the episode with Idowu, and some are not.
What do you assess a footballer's words?
- Looking at what to mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
It was not given.
It means that the referee does not give a second penalty in the opposite goal.
Here is the principle that is being used.
And the second point of double standards is that the referee is watching who is playing.
Lokomotiv played on Saturday and Akhmat has serious complaints about the work of Turbin, because the team was infringed.
Matt Damon played accused rapist Judge Kavanaugh on SNL start
American actor Matt Damon played US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared on the first edition of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
In a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on a rape charge.
The US Supreme Court nominee previously drew attention for his emotional and detailed accounts during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
Kavanaugh, for example, has repeatedly professed his love of beer, but has said he never got drunk to the point of oblivion.
Moreover, in an attempt to exonerate himself of the rape charge, Kavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
These moments were also beaten by Damon.
All I was doing was drinking a lot and not thinking about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunk virgin anyone had ever seen.
Everyone is familiar with it, "said the judge, played by Matt Damon.
Earlier, Kavanaugh was elected chief justice of the United States.
Barbra Streisand has discovered strange behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand has said that clones of her dead dog behave completely differently from the original pet.
"They are not alike.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but you can't clone a soul, "the 76-year-old singer stressed.
In late 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog, a Coton de Tulear breed named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a Chihuahua breed dog named Miracle Milly, who was named the world's smallest dog, had been cloned for the 49th time.
Experts have been cloning the six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
US ponders naval blockade of Russia over oil and gas supplies
The US may begin a naval blockade of Russia in order to gain an advantage in the world energy market.
The American authorities are so eager to fight for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are prepared to resort to a naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main energy suppliers.
US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke spoke about the possibility of a naval blockade the day before.
Contrary to international practice, the US Department of the Interior performs civilian rather than police functions, including the implementation of natural resources policy.
So Zinke's statement fell well within the purview of the agency he heads, though it was not devoid of political overtones.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said the US Navy controls sea lanes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
Zinke's words suggested that the need may be related to Washington's desire to interfere with Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from supplies to the world market of oil and gas.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow's activism in the region, Zinke is sure.
The minister made it clear that the US still expects to ensure its leadership in the world energy market by becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do so, Washington will have to squeeze out Russia and Iran, and a naval blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure along the way, Zinke believes.

A club has appeared in Russia that I am following
Former Chelsea and England captain John Terry - about why he attended the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship Spartak - Rostov (0: 1).
"In Russia, I have got a club that I follow.
I've been watching quite recently and I was interested to see him from the sidelines.
I can't say that I am a fan, as my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartak and once again I want to apologize for the decision, "the Chelsea fans" website quotes Terry as saying.
Recall, "Rostov" with 18 points rose to third place in the standings, and "Spartak" settled down on the fifth line, having 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, on October 7, red and white on the road will play with "Enisey", and Valery Karpin's wards the day before will host "Orenburg".
An expensive violin was handed over to a pawn shop for a pittance
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawn shop in Somerville, Massachusetts, a pawn shop worker offered just $50 for what looked like an old and unpresentable instrument.
But experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected that it was an ancient and expensive tool, and sought advice from an expert.
Here and it turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at 250 thousand dollars.
The bonds to the violin alone are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin had recently been stolen from one of the city's residents, and the instrument was returned to its rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the man who handed it over to the pawnshop, but he has no record of any previous run-ins with the law.
The manager says that now everyone bringing a violin to the pawn shop will be asked to play it to make sure that it really belongs to the customer.
In the ninth round of the RPL, an exciting confrontation awaits us: "Spartak" will host "Rostov" at its stadium in Tushin under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a man, as it is known, not at all alien to the "people's team".
The special piquancy of this meeting is given by the fact that the clubs now have an equal number of points - 15 each, and they share 3 and 4 places in the standings, lagging far behind Zenit and being one point behind Krasnodar, which plays tomorrow with Dynamo.
The red and white now have a difficult streak: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League Massimo Carrera's team unexpectedly flew "Rapida", and recently lost at home to "Ahmat".
After the derby with CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, Spartak beat Chernomorets with minimal score and not without difficulty in the Cup, and it is too early to say whether Russia's most popular club has come close to getting out of the crisis.
"Rostov" could not win three matches in a row, but knows no defeats for five matches already.
Let's see if Karpin can extend the win-win streak with such a crucial match for himself.
The previous meeting of the Karpinsky "Rostov" with "Spartak" ended in favor of the capital team.
Start - at 19: 00.
Indonesia rocked by aftershocks after massive tsunami
In Indonesia, where a few days ago there was an earthquake that triggered a three-meter tsunami, meteorologists are watching more than 170 aftershocks.
The magnitude was 7.4, mainly affecting the island of Sulawesi, reports Rossiya 24 TV channel.
The death toll has exceeded 420, and more than five hundred have been injured.
Authorities alerted the public to the tsunami threat in advance, but later canceled it.
The fact is that the instruments did not detect the approach of the wave.
The fate of dozens more residents who were preparing to celebrate the national holiday on one of the embankments of the city of Palu, which was most devastated after the disaster, is still unknown.
London has erupted with accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the Cold War, British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has said.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech to the ruling Conservative Party's convention in Birmingham.
Threats are increasing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, and enemies are operating in grey areas through cyber attacks and false news, the minister added.
But the biggest one is Russia, which is building up its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians have been repeatedly denied by Moscow, TASS reports.
At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury last March of ex-GRU colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of spying for the UK, and his daughter Yulia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the country's name.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year-old dispute with neighboring Greece over the country's name, which coincides with that of a neighboring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, an ardent supporter of renaming the republic Northern Macedonia.
The preparations for the referendum and today's vote are being monitored by international organizations.
The head of the monitoring mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of the observers is organized:
Approximately 100 teams traveled across the country to observe the entire process today, from the opening of polling stations to their closing, then the counting of votes and the drafting of protocols.
For a month, 10 of our teams worked in the country, observing the preparations for the vote, the work of the media, compliance with the law on campaign finance and the organization of the referendum.
Fei Dulgheri: "About 500 foreign observers are closely following the voting process.
Observation teams record in detail what is happening and communicate with the members of the election commissions in order to present them in a final report". 
The translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role for mutual understanding.
This was reported on the International Translator's Day, September 30, by professional interpreter-interpreter Barbel Sakse.
She has been involved in translations from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"Germans like to plan events calmly, and Russians, as the proverb goes", harness for a long time, and go fast". 
But it seems to me, for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter, this does not play a significant role, "the specialist said in a comment to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries cannot do without each other, "it is enough to know the history".
And in the future, Sakse noted, there is no point in Germany ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny, "she said.
A day earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country was trying to "forge a relationship" with Russia and maintain it.
According to her, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is being built from the coast of Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, is particularly important for Berlin of mania.

Russians donate one rouble for MP with low salary
In Yekaterinburg, the Humanchek charitable foundation opened a fund-raising event for State Duma deputy Vera Ganzi, who complained about her low salary.
The progress of the campaign can be tracked on the organization's website.
"The Human Charitable Foundation expresses the hope that we will be able to save the servant of the people with the whole world.
We ask all caring people to present a chance for life and a happy future!
All funds raised will be handed over personally to the poor.
God save you! "the foundation said in a statement.

The most frequent amounts of donations are one rouble and 50 kopeks.
At the time of publication of the note, Russians had donated 1,633 roubles to Vera Gansa.

The film "Between Two Seas" received the Golden Shell of the San Sebastian Festival

The film was awarded the main award of the festival - the "Golden Shell".

The comedy "Evening School" topped the American box office
The comedy "Evening School", which debuted in American theaters last Friday, earned $28 million in its first weekend at the box office.
That result allowed the uncomplicated picture, starring Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish, to top the US box office for September 28-30.
In the international market, the film, so far released in only 20 countries, has grossed $5.5 million, including $2 million from British viewers.
In the fight for the first line, Malcolm Lee's creation, remarkably, was well ahead of another newcomer to Western distribution - the cartoon "Smallfoot", the curious story of a charming yeti meeting a member of the human race whose existence the main character never believed.
The project, directed by Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reissig, grossed $23 million during its opening weekend, broadly meeting the expectations of experts who had predicted 20-25 million for the film over the weekend.
As for Smallfoot's total fees, they currently amount to $38.6 million (and it has already debuted in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active, adding 3.6 million to the film's coffers.
This time, the top three were rounded off by the children's fairy tale "The Mystery of the House with the Clock" from horror master Elay Roth, which finally proved that the director knows how to make quality movies for the 12 + audience as well.
In its second week at the box office, the adaptation of John Bellers's book with the charming Jack Black with Cate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing its worldwide total to $53.8 million
Despite dropping out of the top 3, the thriller with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick "A Simple Request" continues to surprise with a "+" sign: in 17 days at the US box office, Paul Fieg's film, from which some unrealistic financial accomplishments were not initially expected from the word "at all", has collected $43 million (including 6.6 million for October 28-30) and right now has as much as 62.9 million total revenue.
The last representative of the top five this week was horror "The Curse of the Nun", which grossed $5.4 million during the reporting period
Spin-off "The Spells", after 24 days in American (and not only, of course) theaters, has $330 million in total earnings and recently proudly holds the title of the most successful film in the franchise, which also includes two parts of "The Spell" itself and two films about the creepy doll Annabelle.
Directly following Corin Hardy's horror at the end of last weekend was another representative of the genre - the debutant "Hallfest", one of the main youth horror of the year.
In its first weekend, the brainchild of acclaimed editor (and recent director) Gregory Plotkin, who has previously worked on a number of big horror projects, including "Happy Death Day", to which Hallfest bears a strong resemblance in places, earned $5.1 million in the US.
Given the film's modest budget, the result is extremely positive.
Seventh was "Crazy Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), which doesn't seem to be thinking about dropping out of the top 10 of the American box office: the romantic comedy, now in its seventh week on screens, is the sixth highest-grossing film of the genre on record in September, with 165.7 million.
This is the amount that the picture has now earned in the domestic market - the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million
As for the last three lucky ones to make the top ten in the United States for September 28-30, they were "Predator", "White Guy Rick" and.".. Crimson Mint", which earned $3.7 million, $2.38 million and $1.1 million, respectively, over the past weekend.
Add that next weekend in the United States the long-awaited "Vienna" with Tom Hardy, who - no doubt about it - will easily take the lead in the American boxing office following the results of the first weekend of October.
Other premieres in the coming week include Bradley Cooper's Oscar-winning musical melodrama A Star Is Born and the crime drama Your Hatred.

Valery Belov: The Lord today was helping Siberia
Vityaz head coach Valery Belov speaks about the defeat by Siberia (3: 4) in the KHL regular-season match.
"A colleague was talking about the fans of" Siberia, "and I want to mark our fans", Belov is quoted as saying by the official Vityaz website.
"I hope they will support as well, because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
In terms of the game, probably the Lord helped "Siberia" today, because they were very grossly mistaken, especially our leaders.
In general, we lost the micro - match 0: 3 our leading leaders, so it was difficult for us to pull this match out, although there were moments.
But nevertheless, I will take the blame.
Because, apparently, they missed something in the preparation.
Compared to the last match it was a different team". 
"This is ugly nepotism"
Viewers outraged by Agutin's choice on The Voice show
Viewers of the show "Voice 60 +" accuse mentor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen rigging".
When, in blind auditions, he recognized from the first notes the voice of his father, Nikolai Agutin, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But filial feelings took over, and he chose a relative on his team.
At the time, many considered it a joke, but forgiven the mentor for being biased at the first stage.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the star's father completely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now viewers are no longer prepared to forgive Agutin for such an injustice.
Yesterday, we viewers of the show were outraged at cronyism by the ugly and blatant dragging of their close relatives onto the final ladder.
I already doubted that Agutin would have the strength and conscience not to drag his dad all the way to the first place, "Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina argued in the program" The Man from TV". 
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "merged" the fine performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience still wants to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, this is not the case at all, viewers want an objective assessment and to see really talented performers in the final, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the members of" The Voice "from Agutin's team - they were doomed".
"Last time, Agutin showed how much he loves his dad, and today he had to show himself as a professional".
"The contest has lost its meaning".
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project your dad who doesn't sing but whispers, how can you name a mentor after that?",
"Like how the pope sings, organize him a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert".
This is "The Voice", not "Cool Families".
"On the part of Agutin, it was unprofessional".
"Then you have to ask your dad to perform on your own show, not on a show that is made for Channel 1 money".
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone else's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should arouse my understanding more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why was a worker from Surgut, with a magnificent voice and timbre, drained, and Agutin's dad brought to the final?
And then we all complain that the same faces have been on stage and off screens for decades!
Because you can't break through the nepotism! "
"What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!
Blat and cronyism are all around.
And the money to the family budget will not be excessive!
The theatre of the absurd continues! "
Users also remembered that in one season of the traditional "Voice", Gradsky's son appeared at blind auditions.
Back then, it never occurred to him to take his son on his own team.
Moreover, he said, "Come on, go from here, everything is clear".
Agutin couldn't act like a professional.
Canada's military allowed to wear beards to boost spirits
Canada's Department of Defense has issued an order that allows service members to wear beards.

The innovation is expected to "boost morale in the military and attract more Canadians to the service".

At the same time, a court in Egypt upheld the decision to suspend police officers who wear beards.

Head of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Anatoly Petrukovich, told RIA Novosti about a possible program of scientific research for Russian cosmonauts on the moon.

"There is no consolidated opinion yet", the scientist stressed.
He noted that one option would be to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the back of the moon, which would avoid interference from the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to investigate cosmic sources of radio emissions", Petrukovich added.
He also believes that the moon could be used to test robotics, use local resources for construction.
In addition, cosmonauts should be involved in the search on the Earth's satellite for primitive organic matter, the scientist believes.
This could help to determine how life appears on the planets.
Earlier, the head of Roscosmos Corporation said that, in an optimistic version, the Russian Federation could carry out a manned flight to the moon by 2030.

I couldn't do anything and it was very painful
Sergei Sirotkin: I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful
The Russian Williams driver, Sergei Sirotkin, commented on the result of the Russian Grand Prix race.
'To be honest, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second corner I found myself between two cars, which immediately squeezed me.
I lost all those positions that I had played at the start, the moment, right away.
I found myself in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We hoped that after the others came to the pit stop, we would get into the "clean air" and the pace would return, but there was no rubber anymore.
Plus struggled with a mate, with him too there was contact.
As I understand it, he was a bit mistaken.
We found ourselves in this situation on the most unraced track of the season, there was nothing I could do and it was very painful to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it any more, "RIA Novosti quotes Sirotkin as saying.
Recall that Sirotkin in the race at the Russian Grand Prix finished 18th, the winner was the British driver of "Mercedes" Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev called the removal of Glushakov and Eshchenko from the basis of "Spartak" absurd
President of the Russian Tennis Federation (FTR) Shamil Tarpischev commented on the suspension of Spartak Moscow players Denis Glushakov and Andrei Eshchenko from training with the main squad after liking the criticism of the head coach of the team, Massimo Carrera, reports "Sport Weekend".
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
It is nonsense to pay attention to such things.
I totally disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It only deepens the discord in the team.
First, they are poems, you can read and perceive them any way you like.
I wouldn't have reacted in Carrera's place to that.
Everyone has an opinion, after all.
Second, everyone wants to be laid to rest.
If Glushakov and Eshchenko put up likes, it does not mean that they have anything against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility of understanding the situation.
And it does not serve the normal climate in the team.
Today, Spartak do not have a game, so this situation did not need to be hyped at all.
Maybe it was just worth having a laugh together.
Spartak have a lot of things wrong with different lines, there is a lack of play after the introduction to the youth structure.
Relations within the team, apparently, do not add to the optimism before this match, "Tarpischev is sure.
The game of the two teams will take place on September 30 and will begin at 19.00 Moscow time.
Having previously turned down Spartak, John Terry has taken charge of Chelsea's youth team.
The pupils of "Sirius" discussed nature-like technologies with scientists
Pupils of the Sirius Educational Center in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists from the Kurchatov Institute, a national research center.
The researchers "speech took place within the framework of the program of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Nature-Like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary film "Kurchatov's Codes", during which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Mikhail Kovalchuk, spoke about global challenges as a driving force of civilization development.
The scientist's lecture is published on the Sirius website.
Pupils have learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
The alternative energy industry is not yet capable of generating such volumes.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, nature-like technologies that young scientists are working on today will help.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, and also spoke about the risks that inevitably arise in the creation of such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a colossal blessing.
It is the explosive growth of medical technology, it is the improvement of the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is a second side.
The development of nature-like technologies is, in fact, the technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There is a flip side - purposeful interference in human activity.
There are always risks.
A car appeared - people began to die under the wheels.
But cars are used all the same.
The dual nature of the technologies at once.
I am creating medical new technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction, "REN TV quotes the scientist as saying.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, schoolchildren were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
The speakers were Yuliya Dyakova, Candidate of Physics and Mathematics, Head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-like technologies at the Kurchatov Institute, and Vyacheslav Demin, Head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS technologies.
The Sirius Educational Center in Sochi was created by the Talent and Success Educational Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure on the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational center's work is the early identification, development and further professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian online Olympiad on information security "Cyber Challenge" will be sent to Sirius for training.

Kemerovo residents were outraged by a herd of sheep at the cemetery
On September 30, a message appeared on a well-known Kemerovo page on a social network from an eyewitness that horned animals roam freely in one of the local cemeteries.
The animals walked between the fences in a large herd and plucked the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: some locals noted that there was no harm in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery, and their appetite could even help in clearing the area of weeds and grass thickets, but some of the city's residents did not like the animals "behavior:
"These are the graves, not the pasture.
Nothing for the sheep to do there.
Of course, you can't say about the sheep that they are blasphemous, but that is not the point". (the style is preserved) - noted the outraged resident of Kemerovo in her message.
Somehow, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known and the necessary measures will be taken soon.
To press and to dominate - how is it right?
The word pressure does not exist.
The right thing to do is dominate.
The word "pressure" in the sense of "pull, influence, influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in "dominate".
We use this word in the belief that it comes from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "domination" are etymologically not only not close, but even in a sense opposite.
See it for yourself.
To be attracted (church-bookish, obsolete) means "enough, enough, enough, enough for someone or something, enough to satisfy".
To be satisfied, pleasure is kindred words.
Before, it still had the meaning of "not to depend on anything, to be self-sufficient" - "to dominate yourself".
Old Slavonic "dovleti" is related to the words "to command" and "will".
To press, to suppress - completely different.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (pressing sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaidī - "to oppress".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "dominate", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, caused them to enter into contagion.
So we have this very "d", which is also used in writing through "a", which, in a good way, is wrong and impossible from the point of view of the processes of emergence and development of these words.
So, the right thing to do is to dominate.
But the word is obsolete, in its correct meaning no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances / people have a negative influence on you from above, use the word "pressure".
You can also use the "apply pressure" construction, but remember that this is a chancery.

Russia has shielded itself from terrorists with an operation in Syria
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists have been killed, of whom 85,000 terrorists have destroyed the Russian Air and Space Forces.
This was told in connection with the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria by Viktor Bondarev, former commander-in-chief of the Supreme Military Council, head of the Federation Council's Committee on Defense and Security.
He noted the high precision of the use of air strikes: the Aerospace Forces have carried out and continue to carry out all strikes precisely against terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, in three years, tens of thousands of terrorist targets have been destroyed in Syria - for example, ammunition depots, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the jihadists "defenses were hacked - a decisive contribution to the advance of Syrian government troops, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria made it possible to shield Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IS, banned in Russia) and Jabhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, about four thousand fighters from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries fought on the side of IS, TASS reports.
And we are talking only about recorded persons, not including those who have not been identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any moment, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter our country's territory.
Thus, Bondaryev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant frontiers - otherwise, this evil "would flow to us".

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kyiv's decision to rename the UOC with the actions of fascists
The head of the Synodal Department for External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate into the Russian Church in Ukraine to the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It is like pointing a yellow pointed star at a Jew in fascist Germany, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and it is for this very purpose that this bill was created", the Metropolitan said on the Rossiya-24 TV channel (quoted by Interfax).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is at an acute stage.
Kyiv thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and "outlaw it", believes the cleric.
"This is a Ukrainian church, and the faithful of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country", he added.
Earlier, it became known that deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).

The deputy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian holy places
The vicar of the Holy Dormition Lavra of Pochaev, Metropolitan Vladimir, issued an appeal to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian sacred sites.
The text of his address to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the monastery's website.
At different times in history, our predecessors and fellow Christians in faith and spirit had to profess their faith and defend their holy places.
Given the situation that has developed, and according to the information that we have and the death threats that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to go through something, too, "stated the Metropolitan.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
The vicar of the Lavra also stressed that "your physical presence will probably be needed".
The cleric added: "Lenin's grandchildren are in spirit, they are threatening to kill, and therefore we will defend our shrine".
Who is not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaev Lavra, an Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, should be prepared to protect it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged not to go along with those who mislead the faithful.
The UOC has canonical status, defined by Tomos on October 29, 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
Now someone wants to make the newly fashionable patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope, Bartholomew, dependent.
The new style, with its consequences, is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are happy with the status that our church has, "noted the vicar of the Lavra.
He recalled that, since October 1990, the UOC has been canonically independent and fully independent in its management.
There is no administrative-financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, Tomos our church already has.
What other Tomos do we need? "noted Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochaevsky, calling on the faithful and all citizens to ask whether other denominations have Tomos, whether they are independent of the Vatican?
The believers, to some extent, figured out and decided which temple to go to.
Some, however, want to sow hostility and discord again.
Some people are envious that the domes on the temples that they want to destroy are shining, "stressed the priest.
The Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The laurel is located on the top of the Pochaevskaya mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopol.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the 13th century.

"It was a good game, interesting, although it went all the way to the goal", Vorobyov was quoted as saying by the official website of "Motorist".
"We tried to play very simple.
Very much liked the first period.
Did not take advantage of a few good moments.
In the second period, the opponent squeezed us a little bit, we stood up.
But the removal has fed us a little bit.
The guys played great, executed the coaching set-up.
I think if we continue to play the right way, the victories will come.
We didn't score, with zero goals games are not won, but the content of the game was right.
Luck will come if we continue to play in this direction". 
"In your opinion", Motorist "added in comparison to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
"Back then, the foreign link didn't play.
In the pre-season, teams were solving other problems, a lot of young guys were playing.
I think it was a completely different game there, a different hockey.
"Motorist" is a good good quality team.
From the standings, it is clear, the team is playing right.
Good hockey, a good atmosphere both in the arena and in the city.
One can wish them only good luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
There are a lot of good players, there are leaders.
A solid defence, a good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were preparing.
We knew that the team was going without defeats, we wanted to break that, but it didn't work out".

The main Macedonian opposition leader refused to vote in referendum
Macedonia is holding a referendum on Sunday, September 30, on the issue of an intergovernmental treaty with Greece to rename the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece?"
Nevertheless, the leader of the leading opposition party, the Inner Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNE), Christian Mitskoski, has stated that he will not vote in the referendum.
As party spokesman Naum Stoilkowski explained, Mitskoski decided to abstain from the vote in order to express his opposition to the treaty, which he considers "harmful".
According to the spokesman, the current referendum resolves the question of renaming the country and nothing more, whereas the strategic goal of the party is to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov also refused to participate in the referendum on September 30.
He explained that he chose the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader considers the renaming of the country a negative factor.
"A new semi-sovereign state with a new name is being created", Ivanov noted.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic - the Republic of North Macedonia - was signed by the Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece on June 17 this year during a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, on which the border between the two countries runs.
This treaty should resolve the long-standing dispute over the name of the country, as well as Skopje's path to NATO and the EU, TASS reminds.

The US is comfortable with the rise in opiate production in Afghanistan
The sharp escalation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 was much talked about in Tehran.
Multilateral consultations involving Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev, were taking place there.
In fact, on Afghan territory, the militants have unleashed a real terrorist war against the state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year has been a record year for the number of bloody terrorist attacks, as a result of which thousands of ordinary Afghans have died, "Patrushev noted.
Afghanistan's woes began far from yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group "Al Qaeda" (banned in the Russian Federation), which settled in Afghanistan.
Less than a month later, America and NATO allies launched military operation Enduring Freedom there.
It has been 17 years.
Many thousands of American troops are still on Afghan soil.
And peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
American troops are cornered behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they buy off the militants for money - if only they would not be touched.
Afghanistan's government controls a smaller part of the country - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - the Taliban (banned in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% is for ISIS terrorists (banned in the Russian Federation).
But they are growing up fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly what they did not succeed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be comfortable with this.
How satisfying that, in the 17 years of the American presence, the production of narcotics (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40-fold.
A huge increase in the area planted with opium poppy and multi-billion dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the country's name.
The agreement to change the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on 17 June as the culmination of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbor's right to be called Macedonia, seeing the name as an attack on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia gets the right to a better future, the hope for social change.
And Greece will enshrine the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise from difficult compromises that cannot make absolutely everyone happy". 
The country's renaming is advocated by the ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against is the conservative opposition and the country's president, Gheorghe Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, it makes no sense for Macedonia to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, led by Zaev, is imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will entail negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that would not like Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans". 
Fay Dulgheri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country finds itself at a crossroads.
The choice that Macedonia's citizens will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole".
