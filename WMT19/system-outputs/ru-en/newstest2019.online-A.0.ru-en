Kosachev: At the 73 session of the UN General Assembly, Russia's theme was virtually absent in a negative manner
The head of the Committee of the Federation Council on International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73 session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it will be able to become a turning in the perception of RUSSIA as an integral participant in solving global world problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73 session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric, to which we are almost accustomed in recent years towards Russia, has now been on the order of more subdued,"-said the senator in an interview published on Sunday " Russian newspaper ".
He explained that in previous years the Russian Federation sometimes "was designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with Ebola, in addition to climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, in any case, in the statement of the group of Western countries, Which was quite unanimous in that regard. "
At the 73 session, Kosachev stressed, "Russia's theme was practically absent in a negative way."
"If we carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the speech of the foreign Minister of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or British, in any case, the choir was not absolutely accurate,"-drew the attention of the politician, Noticing that Russia "was no longer a wall, which is being coached by tennis ball."
The head of the Sovfea Profile Committee does not rule out that this is indicative of a trend which, in his view, "will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may be manifested in a year, two or three."
"I do not rule out that the current session may in some sense be a turning point," Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how Russia can move forward in international affairs".
He cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea as an example.
"While it is unfortunately not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time,"-the MP added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is an "adequate, sensible perception of Russia as not just possible-an integral participant in the solution of global problems of the present".
"I would not like to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that we are somewhere passing a point, for which the movement will no longer be reversed, it will be moving forward,"-he added.
Another "interesting and important sensation" in this context Kosachev called "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop".
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago the Russian opinion, Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, no one was interested in, now the situation is different, "-said the chairman of the Committee Sovfea.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which embodies the West, there are no answers to the questions, how to solve the world problems because of the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas about How to solve the problems of the Middle East, problems of terrorism, problems of non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, problems of migration ".
"And here the request for Russian vision becomes more and more obvious," Kosachev expressed his confidence, stressing that in this sense "the current session is successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia".

ADG became the second most popular in Germany
Anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" beats another record of popularity, and the ratings of Angela Merkel fall.
It seems that German residents began to seriously tire of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, which has made the country a cherished target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The most obvious of all is the latest sociological polls, according to which the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" is becoming more popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and zeehofer are weakening.
This week, the ADG beat another record, rising to the second place in the rating of people's sympathies.
Right-wing conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap in one percentage point can be written off on statistical error, but it should be noted the fact that the ADG created in 2013, from a small group of economists-Euroskeptics, has become a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall standings continues to hold the ruling block of CSU/CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, the trend towards loss of points is visible-back in April the support of Angela Merkel's block was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is declining.
Today in support of Angela Merkel are 48 percent of Germans, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
Let's add that following the Social Democrats settled "green" (15%), left (11%) and Liberals (10%).
The evolution of "alternatives"
The "Alternative for Germany" party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the group "alternative Choice 2013", which included the descendants of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially stood in opposition to the government's course, but at first it dealt only with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and the interaction within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed the "sponsorship" by Germany of weak EU economies, did not exclude the possibility of a return to the German mark and the full withdrawal of the country from the European Union.
Amid the deepening of the immigration crisis, the political platform of the ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the band formed a full-fledged party that took the niche of Euroskeptics and began to harshly criticize the government for failing immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the ADG managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, having received 94 seats (from 709).
Two representatives of the "Alternative for Germany" get seats in the European Parliament.

Term of death of the universe is named
The universe will last approximately 140 billion years, which is ten times the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The research of the international team of scientists is published in the Library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is directed to publication in magazine Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun informs.
To such conclusions experts have come, observing with the help of the camera HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) of the telescope Subaru for approximately ten millions galaxies.
Investigating the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observed world, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Cold Dark Matter), estimated the pace of expansion of the universe, Which was slightly slower than previously thought.
The Subaru Observatory's press release notes that observations have resulted in a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the Planck of the European Space Telescope has clarified the limitations imposed on ΛCDM parameters.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments that the observed world would cease to exist after 22 billion years as a result of the big divide.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
Opportunity to know people's opinion about pension reform postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the Federal Initiative Group of the referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that have registered different wording of the issues (the Central Election Commission has registered five formulations).

This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, the representatives of which did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered to be the simplest and legally capacious.
The majority of the participants of the meeting were supporters of the member of "Fair Russia" Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the CPRF (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups-from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Sviridov previously told "statements" that invitations were sent to all initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups expressed their consent to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (her wording was supported by 15 more subgroups), said "statements" that the invitations were not received and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who is a friend and who is the enemy."

In the match "Loko"-"Ahmat" errors turbine raining down as from the Horn of Abundance
Former judge of the All-Union category Vladimir Levatin commented on the work of referee Evgeny Turdin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Lokomotiv"-"Ahmat" and disassembled the controversial episodes of the game.
-How do you evaluate the refereeing of Evgeny Turin in the match "Lokomotiv"-"Ahmat"?
-I believe that this referee confirmed his unsuitability to the refereeing of matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the heads in the meeting of the fifth round of "Spartak"-"dynamo", neither turbines nor the leaders of the DSI did not make serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result was not slowed down in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private passes of coarse receptions raining down as from the Horn of abundance.
For example, on the 50th minute of the Raillander Eder floods with the help of hands in his penalty area defender "Akhmat" Rodolfo.
The gate is eight meters away, but the turbine does not put a penalty.
-How do you estimate the episode with the participation of Idov, who was in 82 minutes, when it seemed that the ball hit him in the hand?
-I believe that here was the deliberate play of the defender's hand in its penalty area.
The turbine was next to the moment, well sees this episode and its first assistant on the right.
This moment was to be seen by the reserve Judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three slept, and the penalty was not assigned.
Therefore, the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice was trampled.
This was the case when the judging by the notions superseded and buried the sports spirit of the game.
-On 52 minutes of the turbine did not dare to remove the defender of the guests Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight against Kryhovykom, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, defiantly applauded him.
What do you think about this episode?
Did you have to show the second mustard?
-In this moment the turbines and the first yellow card showed not quite on the case.
The second would be illogical.
-Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of refereeing that some teams put a penalty for such violations, as in the episode with Idov, and somehow not.
What is the player's words?
-Depending on what to understand under double standards.
There was a penalty.
He was not given.
So the referee does not give the second penalty to the opposite gate.
Here is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the referee is watching who is playing.
Here played on Saturday "Lokomotiv" and "Akhmat" have serious claims to the work of Turin because the team was infringed.
Matt Damon played accused of raping Judge Cavanaugh at the start of SNL
American actor Matt Damon played the U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, who is charged with rape.
Damon appeared in the first release of the new season of Saturday Night Live broadcast on NBC TV.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavano at a Senate hearing on charges of rape.
The U.S. Supreme Court candidate has previously drawn attention to his emotionless and detailed stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobushar.
Thus, Kavano repeatedly confessed his love for beer, but said that he had never been drunk to unconsciousness.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavano claimed that in those years he was a virgin.
These moments also defeated Damon.
All I did was drink a lot and never think about sex.
I was the most proud, most drunken virgin anyone has ever seen.
Everyone is familiar with it, "said the judge in the performance of Matt Damon.
Kavano was previously elected US Supreme judge.
Barbra Streisand discovered in her cloned canine oddities in behavior
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behave quite differently than the original pet.
"They are not alike.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul, "-said the 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old Koton de Tulaar dog named Samantha, who had to be euthanize because of health problems.
In July 2018 it was reported that the dog of the Chihuahua breed named Miracle-Milli (Miracle Milly), which was named the smallest dog in the world, was cloned in the 49-th time.
Specialists are engaged in cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
US to think about Russia's naval blockade due to oil and gas supplies
In the U.S. can start a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The American authorities have been so zealously in the struggle for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the sea blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's major suppliers of energy.
The head of the US Interior ministry Ryan Zinke told about the possibility of the naval blockade.
Contrary to world practice, the American Ministry of the Interior is not a police officer, but a civilian function, including a natural resource policy.
That's why Zinke's statement came out entirely in the competence of his department, though it was not devoid of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that the U.S. naval forces control the sea routes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
Zinke's words suggested that the need could be related to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the global energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from supplies to the global oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, as in Eastern Europe, was the main motive for Moscow's revitalization in the region, Zinke believes.
The minister made it clear that the United States still expects to provide leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to push Russia and Iran, and the sea blockade of trade routes-an acceptable measure along the way, Zinke said.

"It's a hideous nepotism"
The audience is outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show "Voice"
Spectators of the show "Voice 60 +" accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen manipulation".
When in the blind auditions he from the first notes learned the voice of his father Nikolay Aguutin many hoped that he would remain neutral and would not turn to the performer.
But the sons of the senses took the upper hand, and he chose a relative to his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgiven the mentor bias in the first stage.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the father of the star absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more deserving performers.
And now the spectators are not ready to forgive Agustou such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience of the show, resented the nepotism of the ugly and frank dragging of their close relatives to the final staircase.
I have even doubted that Agustou will have enough strength and conscience not to drag to the end of his dad quite already to the first place, "-said Irina Petrovsky and Ksenia Larina in the program" Man of the TV ".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father Leonid Agutin "leaked" the beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining it to the fact that the audience and further want to see in the show of his father.
But, as it turned out, it is not so, viewers want objective evaluation and see in the finals really talented performers, and now Aguutin discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the participants of the" voices "from the Agutin team-they were doomed."
"Last time Agutin showed how he loved dad, and today he had to show himself a professional."
"The contest has lost its meaning."
"Remove from the project two talented people and leave in the project of his father who does not sing but whispers, how can you then call the mentor?",
"Like Dad sings, organize a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert."
It's the voice show, not the cool cousins show.
"From the side of Agutin it was unprofessional."
"Then it is necessary on the own show to offer to speak to the pope, instead of on a show which is made for money of 1 channel".
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I do not understand why a voiceless pope should cause me to understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why was the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre drained, and father Agustina brought to the finals?
And then we all complain that on stage and from screens the same faces for decades!
Yes, because I can't get through the nepotism! "
"What have you been waiting for?
This is Russia!
Blat and nepotism.
And the money in the family budget will not be superfluous!
The theatre of absurdity continues! "
The users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "voices" on blind auditions the son of Gradsky has left.
Then the meter and the head did not come to take the son in his own team.
What's more, he said, "Come on, get out of here, all clear."
Agutin did not do as a professional.

I had a good start, and in the second corner I was between two cars, which immediately caught me.
I lost all those positions that I played at the start, moment, right away.
I found myself in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
It was hoped that after the rest of the pit stop we would get into the "clean air", and the pace would return, but the rubber was gone.
Plus he fought with a partner, he was also contacted.
I understand he was a little mistaken.

Carrers ' actions were completely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is an unluminous stupidity.
I absolutely disagree with what Carrera does.
This only deepens the discord in the team.
First of all, it is poetry, reading and perceiving them as you wish.
I would not have reacted to this in the place of Karriers.
Everyone has an opinion.
Second, everyone wants to bury themselves.
If Glushkov and Eshchenko put Huskies, it does not mean that they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility of perception of the situation.
And it does not serve the normal climate in the team.
Today, "Spartak" has no game, so this situation was not required to inflate at all.
Maybe we should have laughed at it together.
"Spartak" much is not in order in different lines, there is a non-uniformity after the introduction of youth.
The relations within the team do not seem to add optimism to this match, "Tarpischev is sure.
The game of the two teams will be held on September 30 and will start at 19.00 Moscow time.
Previously, the failed "Spartak" John Terry led the youth team "Chelsea".

This is an explosive growth of medical technology, it is an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is a second side.
The development of nature-like technologies actually has a technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There is a downside-purposeful intervention in the livelihoods of the person.
There are always risks.
A car appeared-people began to die under the wheels.
But cars still use.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I create medical new technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction, "-quoted scientist REN TV.

Kemerovo has angered herd of Rams in cemetery
September 30 on the famous Kemerovo page in the social network appeared a message from an eyewitness that one of the local cemeteries freely roam the horned animals.
The animals of a considerable herd walked between the fence and plucked out the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: some locals noted that there was no harm in the presence of small horned cattle in the cemetery, and their appetite could even help in clearing the territory of weeds and grass thickets, but some of the residents City behavior of animals did not have to liking:
"These are graves, not pasture.
There's nothing ram to do there.
About the Rams, of course you will not say that they are blasphemous, but still not the case. " (style saved)-said in her message indignant Kemerovo.
One way or another, some of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and the necessary measures will be taken soon.
What's the right thing to do?
There is no word for it.
That's right.
The word "to press" in the meaning "to gravitate, to exert influence, to effect" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of the word "cheer".
We use that word in the belief that it comes from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "to cheer up" etymologically not only not close, but even in some sense are opposite.
Make sure you do it yourself.
To Dowst (Tserk.-book, outdated) means "enough, full, sufficient, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy".
Settle for, pleasure-related words.
Previously, he still had the meaning of "not to depend on anything, to have a self-reliant value"-to "cheer himself".
The old Slavic "Dovlѣti" is related to the words "to be told" and "will".
To crush, to suppress-completely other.
These words are truly frightening "relatives": Daos-"wolf" (pressing sheep), Deyja-"die" and Dvaidī-"oppress".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "cheer", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
So we have this very "D [a] volder", which is also used in the letter "A", which, in a good, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
Well, that's right.
But this word is obsolete, in its proper meaning is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have negative influence on you, use the word "press".
You can also use the "exert pressure" design, but remember that it is clerical.

With an operation in Syria, Russia has robbed itself of terrorists
During three years of the Russian military operation in Syria about 100 thousand terrorists have been killed, from them 85 thousand terrorists have destroyed air-space forces of the Russian Federation.
This was explained in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former chief of the VKS, head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev.

Thus, said Bondarev, in Syria Russia fights against international terrorism on distant forefront-otherwise this evil "would have poured to us".

Who cares about the fate of the Pochaev Lavra-Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, we must be ready to protect it, says the address.
The metropolitan called not to go on the occasion of those who mislead the believers.
UOC-has the canonical status defined by Tomom on 29 October 1990 from the mother of the church.
And now someone wants to be addicted to the Novostilnogo patriarch and friend of the Catholic pope Varfolomey.
The new style with its consequences to US Orthodox is unacceptable.
And we are pleased with the status that our church has, "-said Governor Lavra.
He recalled that UOC-since October 1990 is canonically Independent and completely independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability for the Moscow Patriarchate.
Actually Tomis our church already has.
What kind of tomus do we need? "said metropolitan Vladimir Pochaevsky, urging believers and all citizens to ask whether other faiths have Tomis, are they independent from the Vatican?
Believers in some measure understand and decided, in what temple to them to walk.
But someone wants to sow enmity and discord again.
Some people seize envy that shine domes on temples which they want to destroy, "-the priest emphasized.

But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
It is obvious that there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain a sovereign country in the Balkans. "
