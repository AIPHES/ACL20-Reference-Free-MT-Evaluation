The number of recruits from Ukraine preparing to be sent to Donbass is named
The official representative of the People ’ s Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People ’ s Republic ( LNR ) Andrei Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine will send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbass .
According to him , in this way Kiev plans " at least somehow to complete the units " .

During the investigation of the criminal case , several persons involved in the explosion were detained .
According to preliminary data , they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by the Ukrainian special services .

Starting with the mutual threats of destruction , now the leaders of the two countries have adjusted the relationship so much that they are almost in love with each other , the American president said .
The White House owner recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main difficulty in foreign policy .
Trump pointed out that Barack Obama ’ s team had launched relations with the DPRK so much that it could not even call the country ’ s leadership – there they simply did not remove the pipe .
At that time , the US and the DPRK were on the brink of war , and today the North Korean leader writes “ beautiful letters ” to the White House , Trump said .
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work , too , he was " cruel " to Kim Jong-un , which , however , was mutual .
But now their relationship has so much changed that the leaders " fell in love with each other " .
At the same time , Trump has asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media are blaming them for incompetence .
Trump has pointed out that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile testing , and is also closing military test sites .
All this is the merit of the work of his administration , the American president is sure .
Last Tuesday , Donald Trump flattered Kim Jong-un from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly .

At the same time , Trump noted that the sanctions against the DPRK would continue until the Korean Peninsula was completely denuclearized .

Nitsoy called to replace " Moscow language with Ukrainian product "
Ukrainian children 's writer and wrestler for purity of native language Larisa Nitsoy called to displace from Ukraine " the Russian-language Moscow product and the Moscow language " .
It offers to do this with a Ukrainian product - " cultural wave , cultural onslaught " .
Nitsoy shared her thoughts on the " expediency of eliminating the Russian language in Ukraine " with the Ukrainian publication " Observer " .
According to her , the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even already exists and continues to develop further .
Over time , Ukrainians will " recover " from this " Moscow language " , she is convinced .
For example , in neighboring Poland , she said , earlier on television and radio , Russian speech was widely used , but in public space it practically remained .
At the same time , according to Nitsa , Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process : the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language , in her opinion , are only " the expansion of the borders for the Ukrainian speech at the legislative level " .
Earlier , Nitsa shared her experience of maintaining the " Ukrainian-speaking regime " in a children 's camp in Carpathians , where she was invited to work .
In December 2016 , she threatened to court a network of Watsons bookstores , a cashier of one of whom communicated with her in Russian .
Having failed her , Nitsoy rushed to the girl to hand over .
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians she calls " linguistic schizophrenia " , urging Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in the writing of surnames .
Recently , Nitsoy said that the name " Rus " was stolen from Ukrainians , so Russia should be called Moscow .
The anger of the writer could not escape even the Security Service of Ukraine : having come there and having heard conversations of the employees with each other in Russian , she caused a scandal and left , slamming the door .

How did you feel today ? "
" If I stood for 90 minutes , then everything is good !
In fact , I felt good .
Maybe at the end there is a little shore of strength , so that nothing happens .
And so , doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolievich Gasnev brought me to this game , for what to them a big thank you !
" What would you say about the atmosphere in the team ? "
" It is no secret for anybody that after victories and to be restored easier , and the mood in team is good .
Now we have a white stripe , although at first there was black .
It is necessary to continue in the same spirit and please fans " .
" Собучился по игре за то время , что не выходил на поле ? "

Kosachev : At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly , the topic of Russia was almost absent in a negative way
The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it will be able to become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in the solution of global problems .
" The uniqueness of this 73rd session , in my opinion , is that the rhetoric that we have become almost accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been much more muted , " said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper .
He explained that in previous years the Russian Federation sometimes " identified as one of the three main threats to mankind , then along with Ebola , then along with climate change or terrorism , Russia was in this series , at least in the statement of a group of Western countries , which in this regard expressed quite unanimously " .
At the 73rd session , Kosachev stressed , " Russia 's topic was virtually absent in a negative way . "
" If I carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States , the President of France , the speech of the German Foreign Minister , I now do not take Ukraine , Georgia , or the British , in any case , the choir was not exactly , " the politician said , noting that Russia " was no longer a wall , about which punch trains " .
The head of the relevant committee of the Security Council does not rule out that this is indicative of a trend which , in his opinion , " will single out the current session of the [ UN General Assembly ] , although this trend may fully manifest itself in a year , two or three " .
" I do not rule out that this session in a sense can be a turning point , " Kosachev admitted , explaining that " there are too many examples of how Russia can move forward in international affairs with its involvement " .
As an example , he cited the situations in Syria , around Iran and North Korea .
“ Unfortunately , this is not Ukraine yet , but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time , ” added the parliamentarian .
This is due to the fact , he believes , that there is " an adequate , sound perception of Russia as not just a possible - an integral participant in solving the global problems of the present day " .
" I don 't want to make a mistake , but I have a feeling that we are going through a point where the movement will no longer be a reversal , it will be a move forward , " he added .
Kosachev called another " interesting and important feeling " in this context " a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop . "
" I attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [ at the session of the General Assembly ] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , I held my own meetings , and I saw with great pleasure that if a year or two or five years ago Russian opinion , the Russian vision of what is happening in the world , by and large , nobody was interested , then now the situation is different , " said the Chairman of the Committee of the Council .
In his opinion , this is due to the fact that " the so-called new liberal order , which represents the West , has no answers to questions on how to solve world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space , lack of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East , problems of terrorism , problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , problems of migration " .
" And here the request for a Russian vision becomes more and more obvious , " Kosachev expressed confidence , stressing that in this sense " this session is successful for the work of the Russian delegation , successful for Russia . "

As part of the general sex education of children , this should be done by explaining the paguba , because there is a risk determined to the sexual health of the child , both boy and girl .
The problem is objective , it is that the ripening of children comes early enough , and there are further large scissors between their puberty and the ability to formally enter into intersex contacts .

AdG became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant " Alternative for Germany " beats another record of popularity , and Angela Merkel 's ratings are falling .
Apparently , the people of Germany have begun to be seriously tired of Angela Merkel ’ s immigration policy , which has made the country the desired target for millions of refugees from the Middle East .
This is most evident in recent social surveys , according to which the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany is becoming more popular , and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Seehofer are weakening .
This week , the AdG hit another record , rising to the second line in the rating of popular sympathies .
Right-wing conservatives , with 17 percent of popularity , managed to bypass the Social Democrats , who have about 16 percent .
The gap of one percentage point could be written off for statistical error , but the fact that the ADG , created in 2013 from a small group of Euroskeptics economists , had managed to become a serious political force .
The leadership in the overall ranking continues to hold the ruling CSU / CDU bloc , which has about 30 percent .
However , there is a tendency to lose points - as early as April , support for Angela Merkel ’ s bloc was four percentage points higher .
The personal rating of the German Chancellor , who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term , is also decreasing .
Today , 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel , 7 percent lower than last year .
Let us add that the Social Democrats were followed by the " green " ( 15 % ) , the left ( 11 % ) and the liberals ( 10 % ) .
Evolution of " Alternatives "
The Alternative for Germany Party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group , which included people from the Christian Democratic Union .
The group initially opposed the government policy , but initially dealt only with economic issues , including the euro and EU cooperation .
At the same time , the group opposed the " sponsorship " by Germany of weak EU economies , did not rule out the possibility of a return to the German mark and a complete withdrawal of the country from the EU .
Against the background of the deepening immigration crisis , the political platform of the ADG has expanded .
In 2013 , the group became a full-fledged party , which took the niche of Euroskeptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy .
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017 , the APG managed to break through the Bundestag for the first time , having received 94 seats ( out of 709 ) .
Two representatives of " Alternatives for Germany " get seats in the European Parliament .
Published a video with a journalist who called the citizens of Ukraine " a nation of bolvans "

" We have not been taught a culture of reading and accepting texts since our childhood , " the journalist said .
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov ’ s words , accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed .
As previously reported , the State Committee on Television and Radio Broadcasting of the Nezalezhnaya began to fight with literature , which has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities , banning the import of 201 editions .

Named the death date of the universe
The universe will last for about 140 billion years , ten times the age of the observed world , about 13.8 billion years .
The study of the international team of scientists is published in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is aimed at publishing in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan , the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reports .
The experts came to such conclusions by watching with the help of the Hyper Suprime-Cam camera of Subaru telescope for about ten million galaxies .
After tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy , which account for more than 95 per cent of the energy mass of the observed world , scientists , working under the standard cosmological model <unk> CDM ( <unk> Cold Dark Matter ) , estimated the pace of expansion of the universe , which was slightly slower than previously thought .
A press release from the Subaru Observatory noted that the observations had produced a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe , and the inclusion of data from the European space telescope Planck had clarified the limitations imposed on the LCDM parameters .
In July , scientists modeled the possible death of the universe .
Three years earlier , their colleagues presented new arguments that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Gap .
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
The opportunity to hear the people 's opinion on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the federal referendum initiative group against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday .
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups , who registered different wording of questions ( the Central Election Commission registered five formulations ) .
They decided to apply to the CEC for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question : " Are you in favour of not raising the age of eligibility for old-age pension as defined by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1 , 2018 ? "
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup , whose representatives did not participate in the meeting , but it was considered to be the simplest and most legally binding .
The majority of the participants of the meeting were supporters of a member of Fair Russia Ilya Sviridov ( six subgroups ) and KPRF ( four subgroups ) .
They were joined by three independent subgroups from Nizhny Novgorod , Voronezh and Orenburg .
Earlier , Sviridov said to Vedomosti that invitations were sent to all the initiators , and about 40 subgroups agreed to come .
But , for example , Marina Semenova , the head of the Vologda subgroup ( her wording was supported by another 15 subgroups ) , said to Vedomosti that the invitations did not receive and to come did not plan : " We did not understand who the friend , and who the enemy " .

В матче " Локо " - " Ахмат " ошибки Турбина сыпались , как из рога изоблия
The former judge of the All-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship " Lokomotiv " - " Akhmat " and dismantled the controversial episodes of the game .
- How you estimate refereeing of Evgeny Turbin in the match " Lokomotiv " - " Akhmat " ?
- I consider that this arbitrator confirmed his unsuitability to refereeing matches of the Russian Premier League .
I am surprised that the pressure in the meeting of the fifth round of " Spartak " - " Dynamo " , neither Turbin himself , nor the DSI leaders made serious conclusions about his low qualification .
The result didn 't slow down to affect in the ninth round : mistakes in his actions , private omissions of rough receptions fell as from a horn of abundance .
For example , on the 50th minute of the railway worker Eder is throwing a defender , Ahmata Rodolfo , with the help of hands in his penalty area .
From the gate is eight meters , but Turbin does not put a penalty .
- How you estimate an episode involving Idov who was on the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball got to it in hand ?
- I consider that here there was a deliberate game with the hand of the defender in the penalty area .
Turbin was close to the moment , seeing the episode well and his first assistant on the right .
This moment should have been seen by reserve judge Sergey Karasev .
However , all three slept and the penalty was not appointed .
Therefore the score in the match is distorted , and sports justice was violated .
It was the very case when refereeing by concept ousted and buried the sports spirit of the game .
- On the 52nd minute Turbin didn 't decide to remove the defender of guests Oleg Ivanov who violated rules in fight against Krykhovyak , and when the judge showed him a yellow card , evidently applauded him .
What do you think about this episode ?
It was necessary to show the second " mustard " ?
- In this moment Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite on business .
The second would be illogical .
- Oleg Ivanov told after the match about double standards of refereeing that some teams put penalties for such violations , as in an episode with Idov , and somehow isn 't present .
What do you estimate the words of a football player ?
- Looking what to understand by double standards .
There was a penalty .
He was not given .
Thus , the arbitrator does not give a second penalty in the opposite gate .
Here is the principle that is used .
And the second point of double standards that the judge looks who plays .
Here played on Saturday " Lokomotiv " and " Ahmata " have serious claims to work Turbin because the team was injured .
Matt Damon played a rape accused Judge Cavanaugh at the SNL start
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Cavanaugh , who is accused of rape .
Damon appeared in the first release of the new Saturday Night Live season on NBC .
In a small sketch , the actor played Cavanaugh at Senate hearings on charges of rape .
A candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotionality and detail of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobushar .
For example , Cavanaugh repeatedly confessed his love for beer , but said that he had never drunk to the memory .
In addition , in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape , Kavano stated that he had been a virgin in those years .
These moments also beat Damon .
Я только и делал , что много пил и совсем не думал о секс .
I was the most proud , the most drunk virgin anyone ever saw .
Everyone knows it , " said Matt Damon , a judge .
Earlier , Cavanaugh was elected as the supreme judge of the United States .
Barbra Streisand discovered strange behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand said that clones of her dead dog behave quite differently than the original pet .
" They don 't look like that .
In fact , [ clones ] look like she , but it is impossible to clone the soul " , - the 76-year-old singer emphasized .
At the end of 2017 , Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old cat de tulear dog named Samantha , who had to sleep due to health problems .

Experts clone a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature .

The US authorities are so eager to fight for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the naval blockade of Russia , which remains one of the world ’ s major suppliers of energy .
On the possibility of a sea blockade the previous day told the head of the U.S. Interior Ministry Ryan Zinke .
Contrary to world practice , the United States Department of the Interior does not perform police but civilian functions , including natural resource policies .
Therefore , Zinke 's statement came within the competence of his department , although it was not devoid of political colour .
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh , Zinc said that , thanks to the US Navy , it controlled the sea routes in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary .
According to Zinke , the need may be related to Washington 's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market .
Zinke reminded that Russia still receives the lion ’ s share of its revenues from oil and gas supplies to the world market .
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive of Moscow ’ s activation in this region , Zinke believes .
The Minister made it clear that the US still hopes to provide leadership in the global energy market by becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas .
To do this , Washington will have to sweep Russia and Iran , and the maritime blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path , Zinke believes .

Translator compared mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different , but few differences between them do not play a big role for mutual understanding .
This was announced on the International Day of the Translator , September 30 , by professional synchronous translator Berbel Saxe .

According to the translator , to understand that two countries cannot do without each other , " it is enough to know history . "

" This is an immaculate crony "
The audience is outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show " Voice "
Audience of the show " Voice 60 + " accuses the mentor Leonid Agutin of " immaculate nepotism and brazen fraud . "
When he heard the voice of his father , Nikolai Agutin , in blind auditions from the first notes , many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer .
But the son 's feelings prevailed , and he chose a relative in his team .
Then many considered it a joke , but forgave the mentor bias in the first stage .
But the " joke " lasted , and the father of the star absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers .
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutin such injustice .
Yesterday , we , the audience of the show , were indignant by the cunning and frankly dragging the close relatives on the final ladder .
I even doubted that Agutin would have enough strength and conscience not to drag his father to the end at all to the first place " , - Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina argued in the program " Man from TV " .
Meanwhile , for the sake of his father , Leonid Agutin " slashed " the beautiful performers who really sang , while Nikolay Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother , explaining it by the fact that the audience still want to see in the show of his father .
But , as it turned out , it at all not so , the audience want an objective assessment and to see in the ending really talented performers , and now Agutin discredited the show .
" I sympathize with the participants of the " Voices " from the Agutin team - they were doomed . "
" Last time Agutin showed how he loves dad , and today he had to show himself as a professional . "
" The contest has lost its meaning . "
" To remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project his dad who does not sing but whispers , how can you call a mentor after that ? "
" Like Dad singing , organize a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert . "
Это шоу " Голос " , а не шоу " Крутые родинники " .
" This was unprofessional on the part of Agutin . "
" Then it is necessary to offer on own show to act pope , instead of on show which is made for money of Channel 1 . "
" It was a real chance for someone , and he took someone 's place .
And I don 't understand why a hollow dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data .
Why the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre drained , and Papa Agutin brought to the ending ?
And then we all complain that on the stage and from screens the same faces for decades !
Да потому что не пробиться трех кумовство ! "
" What were you waiting for ?
This is Russia !
Кругом блат и кумовсство .
And the money in the family budget will not be superfluous !
The theatre of the absurd continues ! "
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional " Voices " on the blind auditions came the son of Grady .
Then it didn 't come to mind to take a son into own team .
Moreover , he said , " Come on , come from here , everything is clear . "
Agutin could not act as a professional .

Carrer ’ s actions were totally absurd .
To pay attention to such things is nonsense .
I absolutely disagree with what Carrera does .
It only deepens the discord in the team .
First of all , these verses can be read , read and read as you wish .
I would not have reacted to this in the place of Carrera .
Everyone has their own opinion .
Secondly , everyone wants to bury .
If Glushakov and Eshchenko put likes , it doesn 't mean that they have something against the trainer .
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility of perception of the situation .
And it does not serve the normal climate in the team .
Today " Spartacus " has no game , so this situation at all didn 't need to be inflated .
Maybe just together it was worth laughing at it .
" Spartacus " has a lot not in order in different lines , there is inplay after introduction into structure of youth .
Relations within the team , apparently , do not add optimism before this match " , - Tarpischev is sure .
The game of two teams will take place on September 30 and will begin at 19.00 Moscow time .

" The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing , it is a huge benefit .
This is the explosive growth of medical technologies , improving the quality of life and infrastructure .
But there is a second side .
The development of natural technologies is actually a technological reproduction of wildlife systems .
There is a downside - purposeful interference in human life .
There are always risks .
A car appeared - people began to die under the wheels .
But cars still use .
The dual nature of technology at once .
I create a medical new technology , and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction " , - quotes the scientist REN TV .

The animals walked between the flock and the grass .
Commentators expressed different opinions : one of the local residents noted that in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery there is no harm , and their appetite can even help in clearing the territory from weeds and grasses , but some of the residents of the city did not have the behavior of animals to their liking :

Давлать и довлеть - как правильно ?
Words of pressure do not exist .
Правильно - довлекать .
The word " give " in the meaning of " pull , influence , influence " exists only phonetically , because we hear the sound [ a ] instead of [ o ] in the word " catch " .
We use this word , believing that it comes from the word " pressure " .
But " pressure " and " catch up " ethymologically not only are not close , but even in some sense are opposite .
See for yourself .
To take ( church , book , old ) means " enough , full , enough , enough to be sufficient for anyone or anything , to satisfy " .
To be content , pleasure - related words .
Earlier it still had the value " not to depend on anything , to have a self-sufficient value " - " to get to itself " .
Старославянское " довьлети " родственно слования " велеть " и " воля " .
To press , to suppress - completely other .
These words have really frightening " relatives " : daos - " wolf " ( giving sheep ) , deyja - " die " and dvaidī - " oppress " .
A similar phonetic appearance of the words " pressure " and " catch up " , as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter , forced them to conceive .
So we have this very " d [ a ] to drive " , which is also used on the letter through " a " , which , good , is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of creation and development of these words .
Итак , правильно - довлекать .
But this word is obsolete , no longer used in its proper meaning .
If you want to note that any circumstances / people have a negative impact on you from above , use the word " pressure " .
It is also possible to use the " pressure " design , but remember that it is an office .

Through the operation in Syria , Russia has shielded itself from terrorists
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria , about 100,000 terrorists were killed , including 85,000 terrorists who destroyed the Russian Air and Space Forces .
This was told in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by former head of the CCS , head of the Federation Defense and Security Council Committee Viktor Bondarev .
He noted the high precision in the use of air strikes : the space and air forces have carried out and continue to strike all attacks on terrorist targets .
According to Bondarev , tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria in three years , such as ammunition depots , fortifications and headquarters .
With the help of Russian air strikes , the defense of jihadists was hacked - it was a decisive contribution to the advancement of the Syrian government troops , Interfax reports .
At the same time , according to Bondarev , the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists , many of whom had Russian passports .
At the beginning of the operation in Syria , more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups , including the Islamic State ( ISIS , banned in Russia ) and Jabhat al-Nusra ( banned in Russia ) .
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation , about four thousand fighters from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries fought on the side of the ISIS .
And we are talking only about the registered persons , not counting those who were not identified , Bondarev stressed .
Most of them were trained and ready to take arms into their hands at any time , and Russian passports gave them the right to enter freely the territory of our country .
Thus , Bondarev noted , in Syria , Russia is fighting international terrorism on the distant borders - otherwise this evil would " bounce to us . "

" It 's like pointing a yellow pointed star in fascist Germany to a Jew , it means marking the Church as an enemy organization , and it is for this purpose that this bill was created , " said the Metropolitan on the TV channel " Russia-24 " ( quote on " Interfax " ) .
In his opinion , this step will have the most serious consequences right now , when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage .
Kyiv thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and " outlaw it " , the priest believes .
" It is a Ukrainian church , and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians , they are patriots of their country , " he added .
Earlier it became known that deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills Nos. <unk> ( on change of subordination of religious communities ) , <unk> ( on special status of religious organizations ) and <unk> ( on change of name of religious organizations ) .

Deputy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian holy sites
Metropolitan Vladimir , deputy of St. Uspenskaya Lavra of Pochaev , made a call to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian holy sites .
The text of his appeal to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church ( UOC ) was published on Saturday on the site of the monastery .
In different times of history , our predecessors and our family members , in faith and spirit , had to confess their faith and defend their holy places .
Taking into account the situation that has developed , and according to the information we have , and on the threats of massacres that are spreading , it is clear that we will have to survive , " said the Metropolitan .
He asked for support - prayer , moral .
Also the deputy of the Lavra stressed that it is likely " will need your physical presence " .
The minister added : “ Lenin ’ s grandchildren , in spirit , are threatened with death , and therefore we will defend our holy place . ”
Who is not indifferent to the fate of Pochaev Lavra - Orthodox Ukrainian and world holy , it is necessary to be ready to protect it , the address says .
The Metropolitan urged not to follow the example of those who mislead believers .
The UOC has a canonical status defined by Tomos of October 29 , 1990 from the Mother of the Church .
And now someone wants to make dependent on the newly-stylish patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew .
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox .
And we are happy with the status that our church has , " the governor of the Lavra said .
He recalled that the UOC had been canonically independent and fully independent in its administration since October 1990 .
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate .
Actually Tomos our church already has .
What else do we need Tomos ? " said Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochaev , urging believers and all citizens to ask whether other denominations have Tomos , are they independent from the Vatican ?
Believers to some extent understood and defined what temple to them to go to .
However , someone wants to sow enmity and strife again .
Some are envied by envy that the domes shine on the temples that they want to destroy , " said the priest .
Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine .
The Lavra is located on the top of the Pochaev mountain , 70 kilometers from Ternopil .
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the XIII century .

The United States is pleased with the growth of opiate production in Afghanistan
On September 26 , much was said about the sharp aggravation of the situation in Afghanistan in Tehran .
There were multilateral consultations with Iran , India , China , Afghanistan and Russia , represented by Secretary of the Security Council Nikolay Patrushev .
In fact , on Afghan territory , militants unleashed a real terrorist war against the State authorities and the civilian population of the country .
This year has been a record year in terms of the number of bloody terrorist attacks that killed thousands of ordinary Afghans , ” Patrushev said .
The ills of Afghanistan did not begin yesterday .
After the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group " Al-Qaida " ( banned in the Russian Federation ) , which settled in Afghanistan .
Within a month , America and NATO allies launched a military operation called Enduring Freedom .
17 years have passed .
Thousands of American troops are still on Afghan soil .
And peaceful life is even more ghosts than then .
American troops were driven out of dozens of their bases .
As they can , they buy back from the militants for money - only if they were not touched .
The government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40 % , according to Patrushev .
50 % of the Taliban ( prohibited in the Russian Federation ) .
Another 10 % - for ISIS terrorists ( banned in the Russian Federation ) .
But they are growing fast there .
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly what they did not do in Iraq and Syria .
America seems to be happy with it .
It is also gratifying that the production of drugs ( opiates ) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times over the 17 years of the United States presence .
The huge growth of areas sown with opium poppy and multibillion profits .
Macedonians are preparing to vote in the referendum on joining the EU and NATO , subject to the change of name of the country .
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece , which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbour to be called Macedonia , seeing in such a name the attempt on the Greek province and Greek history of the same name .
Lyupko Petkovski , political scientist : " Through this agreement Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is entitled to a better future , hope for social change .
And Greece will consolidate the right to its past .
There are no perfect agreements .
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy . "
The renaming of the country is supported by the ruling Social Democrats , led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev .
Against is the conservative opposition and the president of the country George Ivanov .
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov , Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it : " Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the present socialist government headed by Zaev is imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country .
But this decision will have negative consequences .
First of all , the loss of sovereignty .
It is obvious that there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans . "
Fei Dulgheri , Euronews : " The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history .
The country was at a crossroads .
The choice that Macedonian citizens will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans , but also of Europe as a whole . "
