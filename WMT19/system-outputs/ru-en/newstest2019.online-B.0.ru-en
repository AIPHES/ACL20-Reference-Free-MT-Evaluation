The number of recruits preparing to be sent to Donbass from Ukraine is named
The official representative of the People’s Militia of the self-proclaimed Lugansk People’s Republic (LNR), Andrei Marochko, said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new recruits to the Donbass.
According to him, in this way Kiev plans to "somehow complete the units."
“The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass layoffs led to low staffing levels,” said Marochko, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians drafted into the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev began the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the operation of the joint forces (EP).
It was assumed that this measure would lead to the strengthening of the role of Ukrainian security officials in resolving the situation.
In late August 2018, the situation in the Donbass aggravated due to the murder of the head of the DPR, Alexander Zakharchenko.
The authorities DNR qualified what happened as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by the Ukrainian special services.

Ilon Mask is forced to leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Ilon Musk settled their fraud dispute.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the channel, under the agreements reached Mask will have to leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla.
At the same time, the commission allowed Mask to keep the post of the head of Tesla.
As noted, the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $ 20 million.
A similar amount will be charged with Tesla.
At the same time, the money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
According to Forbes magazine, Ilon Musk is an American entrepreneur on the list of the 50 richest people on the planet.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission earlier sued Tesla's CEO Ilona Mask because of his message on Twitter about a possible buyout of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy back all the shares on the exchange at a fixed price of $ 420.
The cost of the share was set at $ 420 allegedly "because of the significance of this number in the culture of marijuana," Bloomberg reported earlier, citing Stephen Paykin, co-director of the security department.

Meanwhile, if Musk could not settle his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would be in danger of being removed from management and even a prison.
About this, in particular, said the former CNBC chairman Harvey Pitt on CNBC.
Musk - "a good guy who can not manage a car company."

Trump spoke about the "love" in Kim Jong-un
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and the DPRK came almost to falling in love with each other, Donald Trump joked.
US President Donald Trump noted a good joke about his successes on the front to resolve the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries straightened the relationship so much that they are almost in love with each other, the American president said.
The host of the White House recalled that he had accepted from the previous administration the North Korean problem as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump said that the team of Barack Obama had launched relations with the DPRK so much that they couldn’t even reach the country's leadership - they simply didn’t pick up the phone.
Then the United States and the DPRK were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes "beautiful letters" to the White House, Trump said.
Trump acknowledged that at the beginning of his work, too, he was “cruel” to Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
But now their relationship has improved so much that the leaders "fell in love".
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the fact that recently Pyongyang has stopped nuclear and rocket tests, and also is closing military ground.
All this is the merit of the work of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump complimented Kim Jong-un from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that the sanctions against the DPRK will continue until the full denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

Nitsoy urged to oust "Moscow language Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of the native language Larisa Nitoy called for ousting from Russia "the Russian-speaking Moscow product and the Moscow language."
She proposes to do this with a Ukrainian product - “a cultural wave, a cultural onslaught”.
Her thoughts on the "expediency of the eradication of the Russian language in Ukraine" Nitsoy shared with the Ukrainian edition "Observer"
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is being prepared now - it even exists and continues to evolve further.
In time, Ukrainians will “recover” from this “Moscow language”, she is convinced.
For example, in the neighboring Poland, according to her, Russian speech was widely used on television and radio earlier, but it practically did not remain in the public space.
At the same time, according to Nitsa, the Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "expanding the boundaries for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level."
Earlier, Nitsa shared the experience of maintaining the "Ukrainian-speaking regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the Watsons bookstore chain with a court, the cashier of one of whom spoke with her in Russian.
Not having achieved her, Nitsoy threw the change into the girl.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians “language schizophrenia”, urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in spelling of surnames.
Nitsoy recently said that the name Rus was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Muscovy.
The writer's anger could not be avoided even by the Security Service of Ukraine: when she came there and heard employees talking to each other in Russian, she caused a scandal and left, slamming the door.

"What can you say about the atmosphere in the team?"
"It is not a secret for anyone that after victories it is easier to recover and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white strip, although at first it was black.
We need to continue in the same spirit and please the fans. "

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia was practically absent in a negative way
Konstantin Kosachev, head of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Federation Council, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not rule out that it can be a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global world problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, lies in the fact that the rhetoric to which we have almost become accustomed in recent years towards Russia has now been an order of magnitude more muffled," said the senator in an interview published Sunday. Russian newspaper. "
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes "designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, then along with Ebola, then along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this series, at least in the presentation of a group of Western countries which was fairly unanimous on this. "
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "the topic of Russia was practically absent in a negative way."
“If we carefully analyze the speech of the US President, the French President, the speech of the German Foreign Minister, I don’t take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, there was absolutely no chorus,” the politician noted, noting that Russia was “more It was not a kind of wall that a tennis ball is trained on. "
The head of the specialized committee of the Federation Council does not exclude that this indicates a certain tendency, which, in his opinion, "will single out the current session of the [UN General Assembly], although this tendency may fully manifest itself in a year, two, three."
"I do not exclude that the current session in some sense may be a turning point," Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how Russia can move forward in international affairs with the connection."
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
“So far, unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time,” the parliamentarian added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there appears "an adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just possible - an integral participant in solving global problems of our time."
"I would not like to be mistaken, but I have a feeling that we are somewhere passing a point beyond which movement will no longer be a reverse movement, it will be a movement forward," he added
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly session] of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I saw with great pleasure that if a year or two or five years ago the world, by and large, no one was interested, now the situation is different, "- said the chairman of the committee of the Federation Council.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, personified with the West, does not have answers to how to solve world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, lack of ideas on how to solve East, problems of terrorism, problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, problems of migration ".
“And here the demand for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious,” Kosachev said, stressing that he considers in this sense “the current session successful for the Russian delegation, successful for Russia.

Onishchenko holds the post of first deputy chairman of the committee on education and science.
Based on the experience of his work, he noted in an interview that teenagers to masturbation are provoked by harmful information that they find on the Internet.
It’s worth fighting at the level of educational institutions and families, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, Deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Moscow Says":
In the framework of the general sexual education of children, this must be done, explaining the destruction, because here there is a risk specific to the sexual health of the child, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it lies in the fact that the maturation of children comes early enough, and further large scissors appear between their puberty and the ability to officially enter into intersexual contacts.
According to Onishchenko, the "bigotry", the hushing up of the "problems of sexual age" and the lack of a culture of adequate parenting prevent the solution of the problem.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers are faced with masturbation.
The deputy believes that practicing the lessons about the dangers of onanism is primarily in the schools of the “hyper-urbanized” regions.
“If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, they will simply not understand us, to put it mildly,” said the professor.

AdG became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" beats another record of popularity, and the ratings of Angela Merkel are falling.
Apparently, the people of Germany began to tire of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, which has made the country a desirable goal for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The latest polls, according to which the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" is becoming more popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Seehofer weaken, most clearly show this.
This week, AdG broke another record, rising to the second line in the rating of popular sympathies.
Right-wing conservatives, with 17 percent of their popularity, managed to outflank the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to the statistical error, but it should be noted the fact that the AdG created in 2013 from a small group of economists-eurosceptics managed to become a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall standings continues to hold the ruling bloc of the CSU / CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a visible tendency to lose points - back in April, support for Angela Merkel’s bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth time in a row, is also dropping.
Today, Angels Merkel is supported by 48 percent of Germans, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
Add that after the Social Democrats are located "green" (15%), the left (11%) and liberals (10%).
Evolution "Alternatives"
The party "Alternative for Germany" was created in September 2012 on the basis of the group "Alternative choice 2013", which included people from the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially stood in opposition to the government’s policy, but at first it dealt only with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and EU cooperation.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany’s “sponsoring” weak EU economies, did not rule out the possibility of a return to the German mark and the country's complete withdrawal from the EU.
Against the backdrop of a deepening immigration crisis, the AdG political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party, which occupied a niche of eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of its immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, AdG managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 deputy chairs (out of 709).
Two representatives of the "Alternatives for Germany" get seats in the European Parliament.

Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio Broadcasting Nezalezhnaya began to struggle with literature, in which there are the slightest hints of criticism from the Kiev authorities, banning the imprint of the 201 edition.

Called the death of the universe
The universe will last about 140 billion years, which is ten times more than the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The study of the international team of scientists posted in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and sent for publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts arrived at similar conclusions by observing about ten million galaxies using the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) camera of the Subaru telescope.
Tracing the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observed world, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Cold Cold Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the Universe, which turned out to be slightly slower than previously thought.
In a press release, the Observatory of Subaru notes that the observations made it possible to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the recording of data from the European space telescope Planck specified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of ΛCDM.
In July, scientists modeled the possible destruction of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments for the fact that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Gap.
Another attempt failed to unite the initiators of the pension referendum
The opportunity to learn the opinion of the people about pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the federal initiative group of the referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
Representatives of 13 subgroups that registered different formulations of questions took part in it (the CEC registered five formulations in total).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a request to register a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "You are in favor of the age set by the legislation on pensions as of July 1, 2018, upon reaching which citizens of Russia are entitled to an old-age pension , did not rise? "
This formulation was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the most simple and legally succinct.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of a member of the Fair Russia Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that invitations were sent to all the initiators, and representatives from about 40 subgroups agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (another 15 subgroups supported her wording), told Vedomosti that she did not receive invitations and did not plan to come: “We did not understand who was friend and who was enemy.

In the match, "Loko" - "Akhmat" Turbine errors rained down from the horn of plenty
Former all-union referee Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Yevgeny Turbina in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship “Lokomotiv” - “Akhmat” and dismantled the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you evaluate the refereeing of Eugene Turbina in the match “Lokomotiv” - “Akhmat”?
- I believe that this referee confirmed his unsuitability to refereeing matches of the Russian Premier League.
It surprises me that the pressure in the meeting of the fifth round of “Spartak” - “Dinamo”, neither Turbin himself, nor the heads of the Sporting Institute made any serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result was not slow in affecting the ninth round: errors in his actions, private omissions of crude tricks rained down from the horn of plenty.
For example, in the 50th minute, Ader’s defender Rodolfo fills Eder with a hand in his own penalty area.
From the gate of eight meters, but the Turbins do not put a penalty.
- How do you evaluate the episode with the participation of Idova, who was in the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball hit his hand?
- I believe that there was a deliberate game with the hand of a defender in his own penalty area.
Turbine was next to the moment, well sees this episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment should have been seen by reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three slept and no penalty was awarded.
Therefore, the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice was violated.
It was the same case when the refereeing on concepts supplanted and buried the sports spirit of the game.
- At the 52nd minute, Turbin did not dare to remove defender Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Kryhovyak, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he defiantly applauded him.
What do you think about this episode?
It was necessary to show the second "yellow card"?
- In this moment Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite in the case.
The second would be illogical.
- After the match, Oleg Ivanov said about double standards of refereeing, that some teams are given a penalty for such violations, as in the episode with Idova, and some are not.
What do you appreciate the words of a football player?
- It depends on what is meant by double standards.
There was a penalty.
He was not given.
Hence, the referee does not give a second penalty in the opposite goal.
Here is the principle that is used.
And the second moment of double standards, that the judge looks, who plays.
I played Lokomotiv on Saturday and Akhmat has serious complaints about the work of Turbine, because the team was injured.
Matt Damon played accused of raping judge Cavanaugh at the start of the SNL
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for US Supreme Court Brett Cavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first release of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Cavano at a senate hearing on rape charges.
A candidate for the US Supreme Court earlier drew attention with his emotionality and the detailing of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobushar.
So, Kavano repeatedly admitted his love for beer, but said that he never got drunk before unconsciousness.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavano stated that in those years he was a virgin.
These moments also beat Damon.
I only did that I drank a lot and didn’t think at all about sex.
I was the proudest, most drunken virgin anyone has ever seen.
Everyone knows that, "said Matt Damon, a judge.
Previously, Cavanaugh was elected as the Supreme Judge of the United States.
Barbra Streisand discovered odd behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behave quite differently than the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it’s impossible to clone the soul, "said the 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old Coton de Tulear dog named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a Chihuahua breed dog named Miracle Milly, who was named the smallest dog in the world, was cloned for the 49th time.
Experts are engaged in cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The United States thought about the sea blockade of Russia because of the supply of oil and gas
In the US, they can start a naval blockade of Russia in order to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The American authorities are so eagerly taken up the struggle for success in the global hydrocarbon market, that they are ready to resort to the naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's major energy suppliers.
On the possibility of a sea blockade on the eve of the said US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to world practice, the US Department of the Interior does not perform police, but civilian functions, including implementing a policy in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke’s statement was completely within the competence of the department he headed, although it was not devoid of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the naval forces, the US controls the sea routes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
According to Zinke, the need may be related to Washington’s desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion’s share of its revenues from supplies of oil and gas to the world market.

In Russia, a club appeared, which I watch
Former captain of “Chelsea” and England national team John Terry - about why he attended the match of the ninth round of the championship of Russia “Spartak” - “Rostov” (0: 1).
"In Russia, I had a club that I follow.
I follow quite recently and it was interesting for me to look at it from the side.
I can’t say that I’m a fan because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartak and want to apologize for the decision, ”the Chelsea fans site quoted Terry as saying.
Recall, “Rostov” with 18 points rose to third place in the standings, and “Spartak” is located on the fifth line, having 15 points in active.

Dear violin passed to the pawnshop for a pittance
When a man brought a violin to a LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop located in the city of Somerville, Massachusetts, the pawnshop worker offered only $ 50 for an old and unpresentable tool.
But an experienced store manager, Dylan McDermmitt, suspected that it was an old and expensive tool, and turned to an expert for advice.
It was then that it turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin maker Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at 250 thousand dollars.
Only bows to the violin are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
An investigation revealed that the violin had recently been stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the instrument was returned to its rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the person who passed it to the pawnshop, but no previous clashes with the law are listed.
The manager says that now everyone who brings a violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play on it to make sure that it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, an exciting confrontation awaits us: “Spartak” will take on its stadium in Tushin “Rostov” under the direction of Valery Karpin - a man, as you know, not a stranger to a “people's team”.
The special piquancy of this meeting gives the fact that the clubs now have an equal number of points - 15 each, and they share 3 and 4 places in the standings, lagging behind the far-away Zenit and being one point away from "Dynamo".
The red-and-whites now have a difficult time: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League team Massimo Carrera suddenly flew Rapid, and recently lost to Akhmat at home.
After the derby with CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, “Spartak” with a minimum score and not without difficulty beat Chernomorets in the Cup, and it is too early to say whether the most popular Russian club has approached the end of the crisis.
“Rostov” three games in a row could not win, but the defeat does not know now for five matches.
Let's see if Karpin will be able to extend a win-win series with such a crucial match for himself.
The previous meeting of Karpinsky “Rostov” with “Spartak” ended in favor of the capital team.
The start is at 19:00.

Translator compared the mentality of Russian and German
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a large role for mutual understanding.
About this on the International Day of the Translator, September 30, was told by professional simultaneous translator Berbel Saxe.
She has been translating from Russian and English for over 30 years.
“The Germans like to calmly plan events, and the Russians, as the saying goes,“ harness themselves for a long time and drive fast.
But it seems to me that for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter this does not play a significant role, ”said the expert in the RIA Novosti commentary.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries can’t do without each other, “it’s enough to know history.”
And in the future, said Sax, Germany it makes no sense to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny, "she said.
A day earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country was trying to "establish relations" with Russia and support them.
According to her, for Berlin, the mania is especially important for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is being built from the coast of Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

Comedy "Evening School" led the American box office
Comedy "Evening School", which debuted in American cinemas last Friday, for its first weekend at the box office earned $ 28 million.
This result allowed an uncomplicated film with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish in leading roles to lead the US box office for September 28-30.
On the international market, the film, which has so far been released only in 20 countries, has collected $ 5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the struggle for the first line of Malcolm Lee's creation, which is remarkable, quite noticeably ahead of another newcomer of the western hire - the cartoon “Smallfoot,” a curious story of a charming yeti dating a member of the human race, in whose existence the main character never believed.
The project of filmmakers Carey Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig collected $ 23 million for their starting weekend, meeting expectations of experts who predicted 20-25 million for the weekend.
As for the total fees of Smallfoot, at the moment they amount to $ 38.6 million (at the same time he made his debut in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active here, filling up the film’s treasury by 3.6 million
This time the top three of the strongest were closed by a children's fairy tale “The Secret of the House with a Clock” by the horror master Eli Roth, who finally proved that the director knows how to make high-quality cinema for an audience of 12+.
For his second week at the box office, the film adaptation of John Bellers' book with charming Jack Black and Cate Blanchett earned $ 12.5 million, bringing the total fees worldwide to 53.8 million
Despite the departure from the top 3, she continues to surprise with the “+” sign the thriller with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick “A Simple Request”: in 17 days in the American box office a picture of Paul Fig, from which some unreal financial accomplishments were not initially expected "absolutely", collected $ 43 million (including 6.6 million for October 28-30) and right now has as much as 62.9 million of total revenue.
The last representative of the top five this week was the horror "The Curse of the Nun," which collected $ 5.4 million during the reporting period
The spin-off of the “Spell” at the end of 24 days in American (and not only, of course) cinemas has in its account $ 330 million of total earnings and more recently proudly bears the title of the most successful franchise film, which also includes two parts of the “Spell” and two tapes about Annabel's dreadful doll.
Right after the horror film, Corina Hardy, following the results of the past weekend, another representative of the genre settled down - debutant “Hellfest”, one of the main youth horror songs of the year.
On his first weekend, the brainchild of a famous editor (and recent director) Gregory Plotkin, who had previously worked on a number of large horror projects, including “Happy Day of Death”, to which Hellfest is very similar in some places, earned US $ 5.1 million.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh became the "Madly Rich Asians" ($ 4.15 million), who, it seems, do not think to drop out of the top 10 American box office: a romantic comedy living on the screens for the seventh week tapes of the genre in the history with an indicator of 165.7 million
This is exactly the amount the picture has currently earned in the domestic market - the total tape revenue is 218.8 million
As for the last three lucky ones, who made it to the top ten in the USA for September 28-30, they were Predator, White Rick and White Crimson Mint, which earned $ 3.7 million over the past weekend, 2.38 million and 1.1 million
Add that next weekend in the United States with might and main will collect the long-awaited “Venom” with Tom Hardy, who - no doubt about it - will seize leadership in the American box office following the first weekend of October without any problems.
Among other prime ministers of the coming week, the musical melodrama “The Star was Born”, the winner of the Venice Film Festival from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama “Your Hatred” are worth highlighting.

Head coach of “Vityaz” Valery Belov - about the defeat of “Siberia” (3: 4) in the KHL regular championship match.
“A colleague spoke about the fans of Siberia, and I want to mention our fans,” the Vityaz official website quotes Belov.
"I hope they will also support, because now almost every game has a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
In the game, perhaps, the Lord today helped “Siberia”, because they were very grossly mistaken, especially our leaders.

Because, apparently, they missed something in preparation.
Compared to last match, it was a different team. "
"This is ugly cronyism"
The audience is outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show "Voice"
The audience of the show “Voice 60+” accuses the mentor Leonid Agutin of “ugly nepotism and brazen fraud”.
When in blind auditions he recognized the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But the filial feelings took over, and he chose a relative in his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgive the mentor bias in the first stage.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the star's father absolutely unnecessarily took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutin such injustice.
Yesterday we, the spectators of the show, were outraged by nepotism by the ugly and frank dragging our close relatives to the final ladder.
I even doubted that Agutin had enough strength and no conscience to drag his father to the very first place to the end, ”argued Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program“ Man from TV ”.
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "merged" wonderful performers who actually sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience still wanted to see his father’s show.
But as it turned out, this is not at all the case; viewers want an objective assessment and see really talented performers in the final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the participants of the Voice from the team of Agutin - they were doomed."
"Last time, Agutin showed how he loves dad, and today he had to prove himself a professional."
"Competition has lost its meaning."
"Remove from the project two talented people and leave your father in the project who does not sing but whispers, how can you call a mentor after that?
"I like how dad sings, organize a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert."
This is the show "Voice", and not the show "Steep Relatives".
"On the side of Agutin, this was unprofessional."
"Then you have to offer your dad on your own show, and not on a show that is done for the money of Channel 1."
"This was a real chance for someone, and he took a seat.
And I don’t understand why the voiceless dad should make me more understanding than any other member with real vocal skills.
Why did the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre be merged, and Agutin's father brought to the final?
And then we all complain that the same faces on the stage and on the screens for decades!
Yes, because not to break through cronyism! "
"What were you waiting for?
Well this is Russia!
Circle of cronyism and cronyism.
And the money in the family budget will not be superfluous!
The theater of the absurd continues! "
Users also recalled that in one of the seasons of the traditional “Voice”, the son of Gradsky came out on blind plays.
Then the meter did not occur to me to take my son into my own team.
Moreover, he said: "Come on, get out of here, everything is clear."
Agutin did not act like a professional.

I lost all the positions that I played at the start, instantly.
Turned out to be in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We hoped that after the others stopped at the pit stop, we would get into the “fresh air” and the pace would return, but the rubber was gone.

The President of the Russian Tennis Federation (FTR), Shamil Tarpishchev, commented on the removal of Spartak Moscow footballers Denis Glushakov and Andrei Eshchenko from training with the main team after the likes of criticism from the head coach Massimo Carrera, Sport Weekend.
Carrera’s actions were completely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is utter nonsense.
I absolutely disagree with what Carrera does.
It only deepens discord in the team.
First, these are poems, you can read and perceive them as you please.
I would not have reacted to this in place of Carrera.
Everybody has an opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to get laid.
If Glushakov and Eshchenko put likes, it does not mean that they have something against the coach.
I think the Italians lack the flexibility of perception of the situation.
And it does not serve the normal climate in the team.
Today, “Spartacus” no game, so this situation did not need to inflate.
Maybe it was just worth it to laugh at it.
“Spartak” a lot is not in order in different lines, there is a lack of play after the introduction of the youth.
Relations within the team, apparently, do not add optimism before this match ", - sure Tarpishchev.
The game of two teams will be held on September 30 and will begin at 19.00 Moscow time.
Earlier, refused “Spartacus” John Terry led the youth team “Chelsea”.

This is an explosive growth of medical technologies, an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is a second side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually a technological reproduction of living systems.
There is a downside - targeted intervention in human life.
There are always risks.

But cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology immediately.

Kemerovchan angered a flock of sheep in the cemetery
On September 30, on a well-known Kemerovo page on a social network, a message appeared from an eyewitness stating that horned animals freely roam one of the local cemeteries.
Animals a considerable herd walked between the fences and plucked the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: some local residents noted that there was no harm in the presence of small ruminants in the cemetery, and their appetite could even help in clearing the territory from weeds and grass thickets, soul:
"These are graves, not pasture.
There is nothing for the sheep to do there.
Of course, you can’t say about the rams that they are blaspheming, but it’s not the case. ”

Press and weigh - how to?
Words don't exist.
That's right - to dominate.
The word "press" in the meaning of "influence, influence," exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "press"
We use this word, believing that it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "prevailing" etymologically are not only not close, but even opposite in some sense.
See for yourself.
Delight (church-book, obsolete) means "pretty, complete, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy."
Be content, pleasure - related words.
Previously, he still had the meaning of "not to depend on anything, to have a self-sufficient value" - "to dominate yourself."
The Old Slavonic word is "related" to the words "command" and "will."
To crush, to suppress - completely different.
These words have really frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (crushing sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaidī - "oppress".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "prevailing", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
So we had this very “d [a] fly”, which is also used in writing through “a”, which, in a good way, is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of origin and development of these words.
So, right - dovlet.
But this word is obsolete, no longer used in its correct meaning.
If you want to point out that any circumstances / people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word "crush".
You can also use the "apply pressure" design, but remember that it is office.

with the operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists
Over the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100 thousand terrorists were killed, of which 85 thousand terrorists destroyed the Russian Air Force.
This was told in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former commander-in-chief of the VKS, the head of the Federation Council committee on defense and security, Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of means of destruction from the air: Aerospace forces inflicted and continue to inflict all strikes precisely on the objects of terrorists.
According to Bondarev, over three years, tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria - for example, we are talking about ammunition depots, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian air strikes, the defense of jihadists was cracked - this was a decisive contribution to the advancement of Syrian government forces, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria made it possible to shield Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the start of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IS, banned in Russia) and Dzhebhat an Nusru (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of the post-Soviet countries fought on the side of the IG, reports TASS.
And we are talking only about recorded persons, not counting those who have not been identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant frontiers - otherwise this evil would have "rushed to us."

During the crash, users could not only see confidential data, but also edit information in the profiles of politicians and journalists.
Thus, in the profile of the Minister for Environment, Ecology and Agriculture, Michael Gove, his photo was replaced with a snapshot of media magnate Rupert Murdoch.
Syria has accused the United States in supporting terrorism
The head of the Syrian Foreign Ministry Walid Moallem accused the United States and their partners in war crimes in Syria and support for terrorism.
The [Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Racca, it destroyed the infrastructure and public services in the areas against which its actions were directed, it committed massacres of civilians, including children and women.
These killings under international law are war crimes, "he said.
According to Muallem, the United States and its partners provided "direct support to terrorists", since the goals of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and meant "sowing chaos, death and destruction on their way."
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost complete, and the country has become more secure and stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria of illegal foreign presence, and the priority in restoring the country will be given to Syrian partners.
In September, Lieutenant-General Vladimir Savchenko, the head of the Russian Center for Reconciliation of the Warring Parties in the Republic, said that two American F-15 planes had attacked the Syrian province of Deir-ez-Zor with forbidden phosphorous munitions.
The US denied all charges.
President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state said this during a trip to the Kharkiv region, commenting on the issuance by Hungary of their passports in Transcarpathia.
Protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine, ”Poroshenko stressed.
According to Poroshenko, he as president will protect Ukrainian citizens, no matter where they are, in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the Foreign Ministry in the passport scandal with Hungary, which consists in the intention to send the consul of this country from Beregovo.
“I fully share every letter that is said by the Foreign Ministry,” the President noted.
As reported by "FACTS", on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the time of issuance of Hungarian passports to the citizens of Ukraine at the Hungarian Consulate in Berehove.
At the same time, they loudly took the oath of loyalty to Hungary.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavel Klimkin noted that the consul of Hungary, who appears on the video with the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, must leave the territory of Ukraine either by decision of Budapest, or else be sent by Kiev.
It also became known that the prosecutor's office of the Transcarpathian region opened a criminal case on the issuance of Hungarian passports.

Putin secretly flew to Siberia
It is known that Vladimir Putin spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the Council of the CIS States, and also held a number of bilateral meetings with presidents of neighboring countries.
Data on the flights of the Russian "board number 1" on the Flightradar website indicate that around 6 pm, Tajik time, on September 28, the Il-96-300 flew from Dushanbe airport and headed for the northeast.
In the area of Lake Balkhash, the aircraft's transponder was turned off.

According to the information of the Baikal24 agency, the head of the region Viktor Zimin personally met the president in Abakan on September 29.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the republic to spend the weekend, but sources of the site believe that the true reason is the “second round problem”.
Next Sunday in Khakassia the second round of the elections of the head of the region will take place.
Valentin Konovalov (Communist Party of the Russian Federation) and the current head of the republic Viktor Zimin ("United Russia") went into it.
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
In the upcoming tour, Andrei Filyagin (Fair Russia) should take part with Konovalov.
Khakass media suggest that Putin may accept the resignation of the head of Khakassia and appoint a new acting head of the republic, and also decide on the fate of Zimin.
Putin has already visited Khakassia in January of this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president’s favorite resting places.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict that has been going on in Syria for seven years.
About five million people fled to other countries, primarily to neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, according to Damascus, hostilities are nearing completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
This was stated by Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem, speaking in the UN:
The government continues reconstruction work in areas destroyed by terrorists, returning them to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions, which complicated people's lives and deprived them of their livelihood.
The Syrian authorities also called on the world community to facilitate the return of refugees and to allocate funds for this.
Meanwhile, the United States and the European Union countries refuse to provide assistance to Syria, stating that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.
“Volkswagen” fully admitted his guilt in “dieselgate” in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the American division of the company, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
Group losses are estimated at at least 25 billion euros.
This amount includes not only fines and compensation.

In February, the management of the company stated that the obligations were already fulfilled in relation to 83% of cars, so the program will be completed ahead of schedule.
Volkswagen is trying hard to compensate for losses and regain the trust of customers.
So, recently the management of the concern has changed again, and a large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system were announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesel engines on their streets: the authorities received this right in February of this year.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared the decision of Kiev to rename the UOC with the actions of the Nazis
The head of the Synodal Department for External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate into the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Nazis against the Jews.
“It’s the same as in fascist Germany to fasten a yellow pointed star to a Jew, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and this bill was created for this purpose,” the Metropolitan said on the air of Russia-24 TV channel (quoted by Interfax ").
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kyiv thus hopes to gain complete control over the UOC and “put it outside the law,” the cleric believes.
"This is the Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country," he added.
It became known earlier that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of draft laws No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter implies the renaming of the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The governor of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian holy places
The Vicar of the Holy Dormition Pochayev Monastery, Metropolitan Vladimir, called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his appeal to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the site of the monastery.
At different times in history, our predecessors and Christians by faith and spirit had to confess their faith and protect their shrines.
Considering the situation that has developed, and according to the information that we have, and the threats of reprisals that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to go through something, "said the metropolitan.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
Also, the vicar of the monastery stressed that it is likely that "you will need your physical presence."
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren are in spirit, threatened with reprisals, and therefore we will defend our shrine."
Who cares about the fate of the Pochaev Lavra, an Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, we must be ready to protect it, the message says.
The Metropolitan urged not to be led by those who mislead believers.
The UOC has the canonical status determined by Tomos of October 29, 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to add to the dependence on the new patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us for the Orthodox.
And we are pleased with the status that our church has, "said the vicar of the monastery.
He recalled that since October 1990, the UOC has been canonically independent and completely independent in its administration.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
Actually tomos our church already has.
What other Tomos do we need? "- noted Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochaev, urging believers and all citizens to ask themselves whether other faiths have Tomos, are they independent from the Vatican?
Believers to some extent figured out and decided which temple to go to.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and strife again.
Some are stung by envy that domes shine on temples that they want to destroy, "the priest emphasized.
Pochayev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
Laurel is located on the top of the Pochaev mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it refers to the beginning of the XIII century.

Good luck will come if we continue to play in this direction. "

At the pre-season, teams solved other tasks, played a lot of young guys.
I think there was a completely different game, another hockey.
Avtomobilist is a good, good team.

50% - at the movement "Taliban" (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% - for terrorists LIH (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But then they are growing rapidly there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly the one that did not work out for them in Iraq and Syria.
America, apparently, it suits.
How satisfied is the fact that over the 17 years of the American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.

But this decision will entail negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans. "
Fei Dulgheri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole. "
