The number of newlyweds from Ukraine preparing to be sent to Donbass is named
The official representative of the People's Militia of the self - proclaimed Lugan People's Republic (DOJ), Andrey Maročko, said that in the winter of 2018 - 2019, Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbass.
He said Kiev was therefore planning to "get the units in any way."
"The desire of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of Ukraine's RAF, the mass dismissals have led to the low staffing of the units," Maročko quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that real figures designed for the Ukrainian army could be increased if needed.
In 2014 - 2017, Kiev launched a so - called antiterrorism operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the Joint Forces (OIC) operation.
That measure was expected to increase the role of Ukrainian forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass escalated from the murder of DOJ leader Alexander Zaharchenko.
The DMV authorities described what had happened as a terrorist attack.
Several people involved in the blast were detained during the criminal investigation.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organised by Ukrainian intelligence agencies.

The head of the British MDMA compared the EU to the Soviet Union and the prison
The British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing member countries of the community.
Such a statement was made by a diplomat at the ruling Conservative Party convention in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, 30 September.
As Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiating process.
What happened to faith in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was set up to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not let anyone leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from community to prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to flee the prison, " the minister said.

In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact once London leaves the community.
In addition, the issue on the Irish border remains open.

Ilon Mask is forced to leave as head of the Tesla Board of Directors
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Ilon Mask settled their controversy in the fraud case.
CNBC News reports.
According to the television station, as part of the agreements reached, Mask will have to leave as head of Tesla's board of directors.
In doing so, the commission allowed Mask to retain the post of Tesla's supervisor.
As noted, the Tesla founder will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
A similar amount will also be recovered from Tesla.
In doing so, the money will be distributed between affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Mask is an American entrepreneur who is on the list of 50 richest people on the planet, according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of SpaceX's space corporation, Neuralink's neurotech company and Tesla's electric car maker, as well as Paypal's co - founder.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had previously sued Tesla CEO Ilona Maska over his report published in a tweet about the company's possible ransom.
Last month, Mask announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all stock on the stock market at a fixed price of $420.
The value of the stock of $420 was allegedly "because of the significance of this number in the marijuana culture," previously reported by Bloomberg, citing the commission's head of security, Stephen Peykin.
In doing so, Ilon Mask subsequently abandoned his plans to buy out the shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman stated that he considered fraud allegations unfounded, and added that he was very disappointed and disappointed with these claims.
"Honour is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I have not violated it in any way," the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
In August, however, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective claim against Mask, complaining of financial losses incurred.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had caused them damages.
In particular, one shareholder stated that the businessman's tweets were misleading, from which Tesla stock sellers were forced to purchase papers at artificially overpriced prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also pointed out that Ilon Mask's indiscretions led to sharp rate fluctuations.
In September, Ilona Maska also accused the head of research company Citron Research of stock market fraud.
Meanwhile, if Mask had not been able to settle his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he would be facing a suspension from the company's management and even a prison.
This was, in particular, claimed to CNBC by the former chairman of the commission, Harvey Pitt.
Mask is a "good guy who can't run a car company."

The opening of penicillin marked the beginning of an era of modern antibiotics, brought global glory to Fleming and made it a Nobel laureate.
By the way, the allocation of penicillin from mold mushrooms was not the first opening of Fleming.

The owner of the White House recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as a major difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had launched relations with the DPRK so much that it could not even reach the country's leadership - where they simply did not answer the phone.
Then the United States and the DPRK were on the doorstep of war, and today the North Korean leader writes "excellent letters " to the White House, Trump noted.
Trump acknowledged that at the beginning of his work, too, "was cruel" to Kim Jong Un, which, however, was mutual.
Now, however, their relationship has excelled so much that the leaders have "fallen in love with each other ."
Trump, however, asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media was stalling them as incompetence.
Trump has drawn attention to the fact that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests, and is closing military sites.
All of this is the merits of his administration's work, I'm sure of the President of the United States.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump flattered Kim Jong Une from the rostrum of the United Nations General Assembly.

Trump, however, noted that sanctions against the DPRK would persist until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

Nicoi called for the "Moscow language " to be expelled by Ukrainian product
The Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of the native language, Larissa Nicoy, called for the expulsion from Ukraine of "Russian Moscow product and Moscow language."
It offers to do so as a Ukrainian product, a "cultural wave, culturally natiful."
Nico shared its thoughts on the "feasibility of eradicating Russian in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian publication "Observer."
She said the Ukrainian product in question is now being prepared - it is even already eating and continues to evolve further.
Over time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language," she is convinced.
For example, in neighbouring Poland, she said, Russian speech was used widely on television and radio, but it was virtually not left in the public space.
However, according to Nico, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities banning the use of the Russian language, in her view, are only "an expansion of borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level ."
Nico had previously shared the experience of maintaining a "Ukrainian regime" at a children's camp in Carpatah, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court's network of Watsons bookstores, one of whom had spoken to her in Russian.
Having not achieved his own, Nicoy threw a handover into the girl.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians it calls "language schizophrenia," calling on Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in the writing of names.
Nicoy recently stated that the name "Russ" had been stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscovia.
The writer's anger could not be avoided even by the Ukrainian Security Service: when she arrived there and heard staff talking to each other in Russian, she caused the scandal and left by slamming the door.

'you've missed a few games because of the damage you suffered at the beginning of the month.
How did it feel today? '
'If you've lasted 90 minutes, then it's fine!
In fact, it felt good.
Maybe at the end there was a bit of a shore of strength to make sure nothing happened.
And so, the doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolivich Gaшнev has led me to this game, for which they are thankful!
"What do you say about the atmosphere in the team?"
'it's no secret to anyone that after winning and recovering is easier, and the mood in the collective is good.
We've got a white lane now, although it was black at first.
We need to continue in the same spirit and please the fans. "
'you miss the game for not going out on the field? '
'There is this, it has been a little missed because the really, unpleasant situation has come out.
But again, thank you to the physiotherapist and doctors for putting them on their feet.
The most important thing is that we have won and pleased the fans.
And the rest is secondary. "

The charge for the Dagestan deputy has become new
The Soviet District Court of Mahacalla has jailed for two months Dagestan Rajab Abdulatipowa, a deputy of the People's Assembly, suspected of engaging in a criminal community that has formalized a handicap for bribery.
The E.E. has become aware of the details of the investigation that shed light on how, according to the Russian Investigative Committee, the younger brother of the former head of the republic, Ramasan Abdulathipov, Rajab Abdoulatipov, has now contributed to criminal actions by the former head of the General Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise, Magomed Mahachev, and his associates.
Among other things, in the course of operational - search activities carried out by Home Office officials, it was found that Rajab Abdulathipov had lobbied the appointment of Magomed Mahachev as head of the bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles for that.
Let us recall that an earlier investigation into Magomed Mahachev, other heads and staff of the territorial Bureau of Medical and Social Sciences underpinned by him, led to a criminal case under Section 210 (establishment of a criminal community using and participating in a service position), Section 290 (bribery by an organized group), Section 292 (official bail) and article. 159 (fraud of a particularly large scale) of the Criminal Code.

While serving as the head of Russia's Federal Migration Service's Office for Dagestan and having ties with state authorities and law enforcement agencies, as well as enjoying his kinship with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdoulatipov, investigators believe, "ensured the activities of other actors in the criminal community, established contacts with state officials to support the illegal activities of Magestan. Gomeda Mahacheva and his tenure as head of the federal treasury agency, the General Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise on the Republic of Dagestan, organized the illegal identification of disabilities to citizens."
Following the release of these information at a meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatypov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, everything that is being charged to me today is all this new to me, completely I'm not familiar with it," he said.
The court arrested the deputy from Unity Russia not for ten days before the charge was brought, as was the case with previous high - ranking Dagestan officials, but immediately for two months, as article 210 of the Criminal Code features in his case.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much more time for the inquiry to be charged - up to 45 days from the time of detention.

Kosachev: at the 73rd session of the un General Assembly, Russia's theme was virtually absent in a negative way
Konstantin Kosachev, head of the Committee of the Federation Council for International Affairs, considers the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly to be a success for Russia and does not rule out that it will be able to become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an inalienable participant in addressing global world problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric we have already been nearly used to in recent years regarding Russia has now been more detached to the order," the senator said in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation had sometimes "identified as one of the three main threats to humanity, that along with Ebola fever, that along with climate change or terrorism, Russia had been in this row, anyway, in the setting of a group of Western countries that had spoken quite unanimously in that regard."
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "Russia's theme was virtually absent in a negative way."
"If we look closely at the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the Foreign Minister of Germany, I am not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, anyway, the choir was not entirely accurate," the politician drew attention, noting that Russia was "no longer a wall to be trained on by the tennis ball strikes."
The head of the Sowfeed Professional Committee does not rule out that this indicates some trend that he believes "will highlight the current session [of the United Nations General Assembly], although this trend may be fully evident in a year, two, three later."
"I do not rule out that the current session may in some sense be a turning point," Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how with Russia's involvement it is possible to move forward in international affairs."
He cited the situations in Syria, around Iran and North Korea as an example.
"So far, unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be required over time," the parliamentarian added.
This is because he believes that there is "an adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just a possible - integral participant in tackling the global problems of modernity."
"I wouldn't want to make a mistake, but I have the feeling that we are somewhere going through a point where the movement will no longer be reversed, it will move forward," he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should evolve."
"I have attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I have held my own meetings, and I am delighted to see that if, another year - two or five years ago, Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, largely now, no one has been interested, the situation is different, " said the Chairman of the Sowfeed Committee.
In his view, this is due to the fact that "the so - called new liberal order that represents the West has no answers to questions about how to address the world's problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, a lack of ideas about how to address the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of nuclear nonproliferation, the problems of migration."
"And here, the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," expressed the confidence of Kosachev, stressing that he believes in this sense "the current session is fortunate for the work of the Russian delegation, which is fortunate for Russia."

The Minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of disqualifying militants from the Russian-banned organization Jebhat an Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, according to Ria Novosti.

At the same time, Muallem believes that talks with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they were interrupted from the us.
On 17 September, Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdogan agreed to establish a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by 15 October.

'i couldn't even hold a spoon'
Wahtang Kicabidze on cancer
Many artists are now talking about how they managed oncology.
The disease unfortunately spares no one, and the history of popular people winning cancer gives hope to many sick people.
The renowned actor Wahtang Kikabidze admitted that he was alive only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
'i'm like a hammer down the skull was struck.
I fell.
Lost orientation.
Placed in the hospital.
The spoon could not hold there, could not stand there, fell all the time.
The analyses started, turned out to be bad things, the arteries don't miss blood.

But the actor's wife did not allow a living actor to be buried, she holy believed that she would be able to cope with the disease and had not wasted more than a year from the bed of her beloved wife.

The reason was "an attempt on Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity ."
In addition, the head of the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the neighbours, was officiated in "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "supporting separatist sentiments in Ukraine" as well as in participating "in the organization of provocation aimed at massively violating Ukraine's citizens' legislation."
Let us note that the hint of Kievo - Pecher Lavra Pavel and the foreman of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) of Onufrey was served in front of Syyarto in the Purgatory.
The reason was their opposition to obtaining Tomos by the Ukrainian estate church.

The authorities named the amount of the "gold parachute" of the Crown Deputy Governor
A lump sum of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronezh region, Yuri Agibalov, was paid on the basis of the regional Public Posts Act.

According to the law, the salary for Agibalova's position is 11,189 rubles.

State deputy called for schoolchildren to be told about the harm of masturbation
Onychenko serves as the first deputy chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on his work experience, he noted in an interview that teenagers are provoking the harmful information they find online to masturbate.
Fighting this is at the level of educational institutions and the family, the deputy added.
Gennady Onychenko, deputy state of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the Govorit Moscow radio station:
As part of the overall sex education of children, this needs to be done by explaining the pugubu because there is a risk to the child's sexual health, both boys and girls.
The problem is objective, it is that the ripeness of children comes early enough, and there are further large scissors between their sexual maturation and the possibility of official interpolar contacts.
According to Onychenko, tackling the problem is hampered by "banning," silenced by "sex problems" and lack of a culture of adequate child rearing.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers are facing downhill.
The deputy believes that practising lessons on the harm of sheнизma is primarily in the schools of "hyper-urbanized" regions.

Adg became second in popularity in Germany
The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany is hitting another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
It seems that Germans have begun to be seriously tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has led the country to become a premeditated target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The latest social surveys suggest that the Alternative for Germany anti-immigrant party is becoming increasingly popular and the positions of Merkel and Zeehofer's governing bloc are weakening.
This week, the Adh hit another record, climbing the second line in the rankings of people's sympathies.
Right conservatives with 17 per cent of popularity have managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 per cent.
The gap of one percentage point can be written off as a statistical error, but it cannot be noted, however, that the Adga, established in 2013 from a small group of economists - Eurosceptics, has been able to turn into a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall set so far continues to be held by the ruling HCC / HDS bloc, which has some 30 per cent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points here - back in April, Angela Merkel's bloc support was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who leads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans are in favour of Angela Merkel, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
In addition, the Greens (15 per cent), the Left (11 per cent) and the Liberals (10 per cent) were followed by the Social Democrats.
Evolution of Alternatives
The Alternative for Germany party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially stood in opposition to the government course, but only economic issues, including euro issues and interactions within the EU, were dealt with at the first time.
However, the group opposed Germany's "sponsoring" of the EU's weak economies, and did not rule out the possibility of a return to the German mark and the country's full withdrawal from the European Union.
Against the backdrop of the deepening immigration crisis, Adh's political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full party that occupied a niche of Eurosceptics and began to severely criticize the government for failing immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the Adh managed to get to Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (of 709).
Two representatives of the Alternatives for Germany get seats in the European Parliament.
A video has been published with a journalist calling Ukrainian citizens a "nation of bollocks"
The leading political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books, Ostap Drosdov, admitted lively that he believed his compatriots to be a "nation of bollocks."
They believe in television and don't read much.
As Drosdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We have not been vaccinated since childhood with a culture of reading and acceptance of texts," said the journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drosdov's words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Broadcasting, has begun to combat the literature, which has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities by banning the entry of 201 editions.

Canadians created a car in case of apocalypse - a magazine behind the wheel
Anyone who wants to buy this car can buy it.
Roshel Defence Solutions stated that it was already accepting applications for its new armour.
Armchair apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
On the subject of apocalypse, money is not only made by video game manufacturers, film studios and book publishers.
The new niche is now being embraced by car companies as well.
So Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its armoured apocalypse senator APC.
In a free time of fantasy, the engineers of this company are creating armoured vehicles for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers who are not particularly comfortable but fully safely housed in a targeted armchair.
This bunker, otherwise, will not be named because its reservation level is in line with standard B7, is installed on a chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup.
Its bottom, also armoured, is capable of protecting the capsule from bombings by grenades and anti - personnel mines.
Roshel Senator APC's armoured apocalypse salon
To ensure that passengers are not even hurt by an explosive wave from a snap near the car, the car salon is equipped with special amortizing chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and firefighting system.
For a safe review, Roshel Senator APC's car is equipped with a circular view camera system with a night vision function, as well as a viewing armoured tower on the roof.
There are no weapons in the car.
Front of the armoured apocalypse Roshel Senator APC saloon
To prevent the severity of the armoured vehicle from affecting its mobility, Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330 - strong enduring turbo diesel engine of 6.7 litres, all of which power is transferred to four wheels of armour through a 6 - foot automatic gearbox.
There is no chance of getting stuck at all by an apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
The armour of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC can be seen at a specialized exhibition in Washington, D.C., to be held in October.
Name of the time of death of the Universe
The universe is still roughly 140 billion years old, ten times the age of the world seen, which is about 13.8 billion years old.
The study by an international team of scientists is put into the arXiv.org Library of electronic preprints and is aimed at publishing in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, according to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Such findings were reached by specialists watching, with the help of the HSC (Hyper Suprime - Cam) telescope Subaru, about ten million galaxies.
Tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, accounting for more than 95 per cent of energy - the masses of the observed world, scientists, working as part of the standard cosmological model λcdm (^ Cold Dark Matter), assessed the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously thought.
The Subaru Observatory's press release notes that the observations allowed for a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the data from the European Space Telescope Planck clarified the limitations placed on the λcdm parameters.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments that the watched world would cease to exist after 22 billion years as a result of the Greater Difference.
Another attempt to unite the proponents of the pension referendum failed
The opportunity to learn the people's views on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
There was a meeting of the Commonwealth Action Group of the referendum against raising the retirement age in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups who registered different wordings of the issues (a total of five formulations were registered by the Central Bureau).
They decided to apply to the CEC for the registration of a single action group and ask the Russians the question: "Are you in favour of not raising the age defined by the pension legislation as of July 1, 2018, at which time Russian citizens are entitled to an old age pension?"
This language was registered by a voodoo sub-group whose representatives were not involved in the meeting, but it was found to be the simplest and most legally binding.
The majority of the participants in the assembly were supporters of Justice Russia member Ilya Sviridova (six subgroups) and the cpf (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups, from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Sviridov previously told the Waters that the invitations had been sent to all initials, and the agreement to come had been expressed by representatives of some 40 subgroups.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who chaired the Vologda Subgroup (its wording was supported by 15 other sub-groups), said to the Waters that the invitations had not been received and had not been planned to come: "We did not understand who the friend was but who the enemy was."

The Chief Coach of Ak Bars, Zinetula Bilaletdinov, summarized the match of the regular Khloe Championship against Admiral (4: 2).

The rival has fought with dignity, has caused us great problems.

In the Loco - Ahmat match, Turbin's errors soared as from horns of abundance
Vladimir Levitin, a former Commons Judge, commented on the work of arbitrator Yevgeny Turbin in the 9th round of the Russia Locomotion Championship, Ahmat, and selected controversial episodes of the game.
How do you evaluate Eugenia Turbina's judgeship in the Locomotion - Ahmat match?
- I believe that this arbitrator has affirmed his unsuitability to judge Russian Premier League matches.
I am surprised that the backfires in the fifth round of Spartacus - Dinamo, neither Turbin himself nor DSI leaders have drawn serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in its actions, private passages of rough admissions soared as a horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute, Eder's railroad bursts with his hands in his penalty area of Ahmat Rodolfo's defender.
Eight metres from the gate, but Turbin does not put a penalty.
- How do you assess an episode involving Idow, which was 82 minutes when it appeared to have hit his hand?
- I believe there was a deliberate game here with the defender's hand in his penalty area.
The turbine was near the moment, well seeing the episode and its first assistant on the right.
Reserve Judge Sergey Karasev should have seen this moment as well.
Nevertheless, all three were asleep and no penalty was set.
That's why the score in the game is distorted and sports justice has proved to be flawed.
It was the same case that the judgeship on concepts had harassed and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
For 52 minutes, Turbin did not decide to remove the guest defender Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against the Crown, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he was demonstrably applauded.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you need to show the second "mustard"?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card were shown not quite in the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of the judiciary that some teams were being penalized for violations such as the Idow episode and some not.
What do you value the footballer's words?
- Such as double standards are to be understood.
There was a penalty.
It was not given.
Thus, the arbitrator does not give a second penalty to the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is being used.
And the second point of double standards that the judge looks at who plays.
Here he played Locomotion on Saturday and Ahmat has serious claims about Turbin's work because the team has been hampered.
Matt Damon played rape accused Judge Kavanaugh at SNL start
American actor Matt Damon played U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of the new Saturday Night Live broadcast season on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on rape charges.
The candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court has previously drawn attention to his emotionalness and detailing his stories in an interview with Senator Amy Klobushar.
Thus, Kavano has repeatedly acknowledged his love for beer, but has said that he has never been drunk before inpatient.
In addition, in an attempt to acquit himself on rape charges, Kavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
Damon also played those moments.
I just did that I drank a lot and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunken virgin anyone has ever seen.
Everyone is familiar with this, "said the judge in the execution of Matt Damon.
Kavanaugh had previously been elected U.S. Supreme Judge.
Barbra Streisand discovered strangeness in behaviour from her cloned dogs
American singer Barbara Streisand stated that her dead dog clones behave completely differently than the original pet.
'They're not similar.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul, " the 76 - year - old singer stressed.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old dog of the species coton - de - tulear named Samantha, who had to be adopted because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the Chihuahua breeds called Miracle Milly (Miracle Milly), who was named the world's smallest dog, had been cloned for the 49th time.
Specialists are involved in cloning a six - year - old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
U.S. thinks of Russia's maritime blockade from oil and gas supply
In the United States, Russia's maritime blockade could be launched to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
U.S. authorities have been so keen to fight for success in the global carbon market that they are prepared to resort to the maritime blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main energy suppliers.
The possibility of a sea blockade was told by the head of the U.S. Home Office, Ryan Zinke, the previous day.
Contrary to world practice, the American Ministry of the Interior performs not police, but civil functions, including natural resources policies.
Zinke's statement was therefore well within the purview of the agency he led, although it was not devoid of political colour.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke stated that, thanks to U.S. naval forces, the naval routes in the Middle East region are controlled and could block them if necessary.
From Zinke's words, it follows that the need may be linked to Washington's desire to interfere with Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives a lion's share of its revenue from oil and gas supplies to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East also, as in Eastern Europe, was the primary motive for boosting Moscow in the region, I'm sure of Zinke.
The minister made it clear that the United States was still looking forward to securing leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do so, Washington will have to discourage Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke believes.

'it's infamous cummy'
The audience is outraged by Agutin's choice on the Voice Show
The audience of the Voice 60 + show accuses mentor Leonid Agutin of "infamous cummy and naughty subtleness."
When in blind auditions, he learned his father's voice from the first note, Nicolas Agutina, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the perpetrator.
But son feelings took over and he chose a relative to his team.
At the time, many found it a joke, but forgave the instructor of inclusivity in the first phase.
But the "joke" has dragged on, and the star's father has absolutely unreasonably taken the place of more decent performers.
And now the audience is no longer willing to forgive Agutin for such injustice.
Yesterday we, the show's audience, were resented by the clueless and frank sweeping of our close relatives to the final ladder.
I had already even doubted that Agutin would have enough strength and conscience not to drag his dad to the end of his entirely first place, "Irina Petrovska and Xenia Larina reasoned in the TV Man programme.
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "leaked" the excellent performers who did sing, while Nikolai Petrovic whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience still wants to see his father on the show.
But it turns out that is not the case at all, the audience wants an objective assessment and to see really talented performers in the final, and Agutin has now discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the Voice participants from the Agutina team - they were doomed."
"Last time, Agutin showed how he loved his dad, and today he should have shown himself to be a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave your dad in the draft who doesn't sing but whispers, how can you name a mentor after that? "
"He's like singing dad, organise him a concert in the Kremlin for his money and see how many people will come to this concert."
It's a Voice show, not a show called Cruel Family.
"It was unprofessional on the part of Agutin."
'Then you have to offer on your own show to speak to your dad, not on a show made for Canal 1's money.'
'it was a real chance for someone and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voteless dad should give me more understanding than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did a worker from Surguta, with a magnificent voice and a themebre, slip and Agutina's dad get to the finals?
And then we all complain that the same faces have been on stage and off screens for decades!
Yes, because you don't get through the cummy! '
'What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
Circle of bluntness and cummy.
Yes, and the money in the family budget will not be extra!
The theatre of absurdity continues! "
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional Voice, Gradsky's son came out on blind auditions.
Then the meter and the head didn't have to take his son to his own team.
What's more, he said, "Come on, get out of here, it's all clear."
Agutin was unable to act as a professional.

From tomorrow, Russia will begin fines for equity construction violations, and the Russia 24 channel will be transmitted.
Penalties would threaten companies and officials if they did not pass the data on the house being built into the Single Housing Information System in time.
The innovation will help those who have decided to buy an apartment in the new build but are afraid of the developer's bankruptcy.
This was discussed at a conference in St. Petersburg for the construction industry.
Because of the amendments to the equity building law, developers will have to lend fully to the bank.
And many experts have already talked about the possible high cost of apartments.
But as it turns out, far from everyone agrees with that.
In the centre of Kiev, a robber threatened a man with a knife, forcing him to withdraw money in an ATM.
The incident occurred on the evening of 29 September on Ivana Kudri Street, Metropolitan law enforcement officials reported.
According to the victim, the unidentified man approached him and had a conversation, but then suddenly grabbed the knife and demanded that he give him money and a mobile phone.

After the attacker received 4,000 grooms and a phone, he stabbed the victim and fled.'
Law enforcement officers managed to apprehend the robber, and they were a 25-year - Kievlanin.
He now faces up to seven years' imprisonment.

The scientist described a possible scientific program for the Russian expedition to the moon
The head of the Ran Institute for Space Studies, member of the Rand Correspondent Anatoly Petrukovic, told Ria News of a possible research programme for Russian astronauts on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community was now in the process of developing directions for such work.
"Consolidated opinion is not yet available," the scientist stressed.
He noted that one option was the location of a low frequency radio telescope on the back of the moon, which would avoid interference from which the Earth is sourced.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to explore space sources of radio radiation," added Petrukovic.
He also believes that the moon could be used to test robotics, to use local resources to build.
In addition, astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organics on Earth's satellite, according to the scientist.
This could help determine how life appears on the planets.
Previously, the head of the Roscosmos Corporation said that in an optimistic version of the Russian Federation, a piloted flight to the moon could be carried out by 2030.
The offended customer ditched a basket with fecals in store 7 - Eleven
Damian Simms, a 41 - year - old Saint Petersburg (Florida), what is known as "had a tooth" on the manager of the 7 - Eleven network 24 - hour store: in May, he put him out of the store for inappropriate behaviour.
And decided to revenge his enemy in an original way.
At half the second night, he walked into the store and dropped on the floor and on some of the goods on the shelves the contents of the basket brought with him.
There were faeces and urine in the basket that Simms "borrowed" from a nearby mobile biotaulet.
Police officers who arrived at the scene arrested a vigilante.
He was placed in prison and released pending trial on bail of $300.
He was charged with unlawful invasion of other people's property and criminal offences, and was banned from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although Simms' crime seems rather funny than serious, a court sentence may prove surviving enough because he has repeatedly violated the law before: it includes theft in large sizes, robbery, illegal possession of a weapon, driving a car in a state of infrequency and animal abuse.

Sergei Sirotkin: I couldn't do anything and it was very painful
The Williams Russian pilot, Sergei Sirotkin, commented on the result of the Gran race in Russia.
'To be honest, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn I ended up between the two cars that squeezed me right away.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, at the moment, immediately.
Proved to be in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
It was hoped that once the others went to the pit stop, we would get into the "clean air" and return the pace, but there were no rubbers.
Plus, he struggled with his partner, and he was also in contact with him.
I understand that he was a little mistaken.
We ended up in this situation on the most unexplained track of the season, I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.'
Let us recall that Sirotkin, in the race at Gran - in Russia, finished 18 metres, won by British Mercedes pilot Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev described as absurd the removal of Glushkov and Jechenko from the foundation of Spartacus.
The President of the Russian Federation of Tennis (FTP), Shamil Tarpichev, commented on the removal of Moscow's Spartacus footballers Denis Glushkov and Andrea Yeschenko from training with the main composition after a loophole to criticize the team's chief coach, Massimo Carrera, according to the Sport weekend.
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is unsuccessful foolishness.
I absolutely disagree with what Carrera is doing.
This only deepens the discord in the team.
First of all, these are poems, read and perceived as possible.
I would not have reacted to that in the place of Carrera.
Everyone has their own opinion, though.
Secondly, everyone wants to be cherished.
If Glushkov and Jechenko are putting the litters, that does not mean they have anything against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility of perception of the situation.
And that does not serve the normal climate in the team.
Spartacus does not have a game today, so this situation was not required to be blown up at all.
Perhaps it was worth laughing at it together.
Spartacus does not have much in order in different lines, and there is inevitability after being introduced into youth.
The relationship within the team does not seem to add optimism before this match, "Tarpichev is confident.
The game of the two teams will take place on 30 September and begins at 19.00 Moscow time.
Formerly denied Spartacus, John Terry led Chelsea's youth team.
Syrian students discussed natural technologies with scientists
Students at the Sirius Education Center in Sochi, participants at the Academy of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists at the National Courchatov Institute Research Centre.
The researchers' presentation took place as part of a programme of the Global International Forum on Convergent and Natural Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the Education Center website on 29 September.
The lecture was opened by a documentary film, Koda Kurchatova, in which the President of the Kurchatova Institute, a member - correspondent of Ran Mikhail Kowalchuk, described global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The scientist's lecture is published on Sirius's website.
Schoolchildren have learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such volumes.
Tackling this problem, according to the forum's organizers, will be helped by the natural technologies that young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kowalchuk raised the theme of responsibility for developing natural technologies, and described the risks inherent in the creation of such technologies.
'The advent of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a tremendous good.
This is an explosive growth in medical technology, it is an improvement in quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is also a second side.
The development of natural technologies is actually a technological reproduction of living nature systems.
There is a negotiable side - targeted intervention in human lifestyle.
There are always risks.
A car has emerged - people have begun to bend under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I am creating medical new technology, and in doing so, I can create weapons of mass destruction, " cites the REN TV scientist.
After watching the film and discussing contemporary scientific breakthroughs, schoolchildren were able to ask questions to participants at the meeting.
The candidate for physics - mathematical sciences, the head of the Kurchatova Complex NBC - Natural Related Technologies NICC's Curchatova Institute, Julia Djakova, and the head of the NBC's Curchatological Complex, Vyacheslav Demin, were speakers.

Macedonia: the referendum was not because of low turnout
The referendum was intended to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country to Northern Macedonia.
Greece objected to the use by Macedonians of the name of its historic province.
The renaming led the former Yugoslav republic to open its way to NATO and later to the EU.
But, according to the EEFE agency, only 34 per cent of the turnout on Sunday plebiscite "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50 per cent.
However, as the referendum was only advisory, perhaps the authorities in Skopje would decide not to rename.
Speaking shortly after the closure of polling stations, Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a supporter of the change in the name of the republic, said that if there were more "yes" among the votes cast, Macedonia would change the name, regardless of the understatement quorum.

Camperchan angered a herd of lambs in a cemetery
On 30 September, a message from an eyewitness that horny animals are freely floating on one of the local cemeteries was on the notorious Camera page on the social network.
The animals with a large herd were passed between the fences and the grass has exploded.
Commentators expressed different opinions: one local resident noted that there was no harm in the presence of petty cattle in the cemetery and their appetite could even help clear the area from weeds and grasslands, but some of the city's residents did not have to shower the behaviour of the animals:
'it's graves, not pastures.
There's nothing for barans to do there.
The Barans, of course, don't say they're stunned, but it's not the case. " (the style is preserved) - the outrageous camper woman noted in her message.
One way or another, some eyewitnesses pointed out that the animal problem in the middle of the cemetery was already known and the necessary measures would be taken soon.
Push and please - how is it right?
Words do not exist to suppress.
It's right to be satisfied.
The word "push" in the meaning of "tighten, exert influence, influence" exists only fontically because we hear sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "please."
We use that word, believing it comes from the word "pressure ."
But "pressure" and "to please" are not only close, but even in some ways the opposite.
Make sure of it yourself.
Satisfied (church.-knowing, obsolete) means "quite, complete, sufficient, to be sufficient for anyone or anything to satisfy."
Enjoyment, pleasure - kinky words.
In the past, it still had the importance of "not depending on anything, having a self-satisfied meaning" - "to please yourself."
The old-Slavic "widow nytti" is related to the words "vele" and "will."
Pushing, suppressing is completely different.
These words have truly intimidating "relatives": daos - "wolf" (squeezing sheep), deyja - "die" and dweed - "harass."
The similar background appearance of the words "pressure" and "satisfied," as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter, forced them into contamination.
So we have this very "d [a] lie" that is also used through "a" on the letter, which is good, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
So it's right to be satisfied.
But this word is obsolete, no longer used in its proper meaning.
If you want to point out that any circumstances / people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word "push."
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember that it is the office.

Through Syrian operation, Russia has shielded itself from terrorists.
In three years of Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists have been killed, of which 85,000 terrorists have destroyed the Air Force, the Russian Space Force.
This was described in the wake of the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria by Victor Bondarev, former head of the VX, head of the Federation Council's Defence and Security Committee.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of aerial defeat means: air - space forces have carried out and continue to strike all targets accurately against terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist sites have been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition warehouses, strongholds and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the jihadists' defence was hacked - which was a crucial contribution to the advancement of Syria's government troops, the Interfax transfers.
In doing so, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria has allowed Russia itself to be shielded from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including Islamic State (IG, banned in Russia) and Jebhat - an - Nusru (banned in Russia).
According to the Russian Armed Forces Genstab, some 4,000 fighters from Russian nationals and about 5,000 citizens from post-Soviet countries fought on the IG side, the Tass.
And it is only about recorded individuals, not counting those who have not been identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter our country freely.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism at the far frontiers - otherwise this evil would "slap towards us."

Mitropolith Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename KPCC with fascist actions
The head of the synodical Division of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Mitropolith Ilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It is still that in fascist Germany, to pin a yellow sharp star on a Jew, it means to mark the Church as a hostile organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created," said the Mitropolith on "Russia - 24" (quote on "Interfax").
He believes that this move will have the most serious consequences just now that the Russian - Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to get full control of the KPCC and "put it out of the law," according to the priest.
"This is a Ukrainian church, and believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country," he added.
It has previously been known that members of the Supreme Leadership are working to implement Bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).

Given the situation that has evolved, and the information that we have and the threats of massacres that are spreading, it is evident that we will also have to survive something, " said the Mitropolith.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
The lurid hint also stressed that it would probably "need your physical presence."
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren are in spirit, threaten to be massacred and therefore protect their sanctuary."
Who doesn't care about the fate of the Pachaean Lavre, the Orthodox Ukrainian and the world sanctuary, must be prepared to protect it, is said in the address.
Mitropolith has called for not to go about those who mislead believers.
Упtz has canonical status defined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 from Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to be addicted to the news patriarch and a friend of the Catholic Pope's Roman Varfollum.
A new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us.
And we are pleased with the status that our church has, " the lurid hint noted.
He recalled that the Dawc has been canonically independent and fully independent in its governance since October 1990.
There is no administrative - financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
What else do we need Tomos? "- noted the Mitropolith of the Pochayevsky Vladimir, calling on believers and all citizens to ask whether other Tomos faiths have them independent from the Vatican?

U.S. hosts an increase in opiate production in Afghanistan
There was much talk in Tehran about the dramatic worsening of the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September.
There were multilateral consultations involving Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nicolas Patrushev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, militants have launched a genuine terrorist war against the country's state authorities and the civilian population.
The current year has been a record in the number of bloody attacks that have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans, " Patrushev noted.
Afghanistan's troubles began far from yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, Al-Qaida (banned in the Russian Federation), a terrorist group that has been seized in Afghanistan, was declared the main enemy of the United States.
It hasn't been a month since America and NATO allies launched a "Insurmountable Freedom" military operation there.
It's been 17 years.
A multiyear American contingent and now on Afghan soil.
And peace life is even more ghostly than it was then.
U.S. troops are inundated for fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they're being paid off by militants for money - only if they weren't touched.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a smaller portion of the country's territory - 40 per cent, according to Patrusheva.
50 per cent of the Taliban (banned in the Russian Federation).
Another 10 per cent is for ISIS terrorists (banned in the Russian Federation).
However, they are growing rapidly there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly what they did not get in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be comfortable with that.
It is also fitting that in the 17 years of the American presence, drug production (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
A tremendous increase in areas planted with opium poppy and multimillion gains.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum to join the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the country's name.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as the outcome of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbour's right to be known as Macedonia, seeing in that name an assassination attempt on a single Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, a political scientist: "Because of this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is entitled to a better future, hope for public change.
And Greece will enshrine the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They emerge as a result of difficult compromises cannot make absolutely everyone happy. "
The country's rename is advocated by the ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
The anti - conservative opposition and the President of the country, George Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetina Chilemanova, Macedonia has no point in joining the EU - enough to have a partnership with it: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, led by Zaev, is inflicted from outside to change the name of the country.
But that decision would have negative consequences.
First and foremost, the loss of sovereignty.
Clearly, there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans. "
Fey Dulgery, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country has been on the verge of disintegrating.
The choice that Macedonian citizens will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole. "
