Kosachev: At the 73-th session of the UN General Assembly the theme of Russia in the negative key was almost absent
The head of the Federation Council Committee for International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73 session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not rule out that it will be able to become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant of the solution of global problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73-th session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric we have already used in recent years in respect of Russia, was now on the order of more invited", - said the senator in an interview published on Sunday "Russian newspaper".
He explained that in the previous years of the Russian Federation was "identified as one of the three main threats of humanity, along with the fever of Ebola, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, in any case, in the изложения of a group of Western countries, which was expressed enough for this account".
At the 73 session, Kosachev stressed, "the theme of Russia in the negative key was almost absent".
“If I carefully analyze the speech of the U.S. President, French President, German Foreign Minister’s speech, I don’t present to Ukraine, Georgia, or British, in any case, the choir wasn’t absolutely accurate,” said the politician, noting that Russia was “no longer a wall that train blows to the tennis ball.”
The head of the relevant committee of the Conference does not rule out that it testifies about some tendencies which, according to his opinion, "will allocate the current session [the UN General Assembly], although in full this tendency, perhaps, will appear through a year, two, three".
"I don't exclude that the current session in some sense can be a turning point," said Kosachev, explaining that "too many examples of how Russia can move forward in international affairs."
As an example, he led the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"As far as it is, unfortunately, not Ukraine, but I do not doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be at the time demanded," the parliamentarians added.
This is due to the fact that it appears "adequate, common perception of Russia as not just possible - an integral participant in solving global problems of modernity".
"I wouldn't like to ошибаться, but I have a feeling that we somewhere pass the point, for which the movement will no longer be a movement of all five, it will be a move forward", - he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "a request for the Russian vision of how to develop a modern world".
"I was present at the very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I had a great pleasure to see that if two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision is happening in the world, on a big part, nobody was interested, now the situation is different", - said the Chairman of the Committee of the Conference.
According to him, this is due to the fact that "in the so-called new liberal order, which олицетворяют с Западом, there are no answers to questions, how to solve the world problems due to obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problem of terrorism, problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, migration problems".
“And here the demand for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious,” said Kosachev, adding that he believes in this sense “the current session of the successful work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia.”

The term of death of the Universe
The еленная просуществует еще около 140 миллиардов лет, что в десять раз больше возраста наблюдаемого мира, равно около 13,8 миллиарда лет.
The study of the international team of scientists has been put into the library of electronic faculties arXiv.org and is aimed at publishing in Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reported the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
The experts came to such conclusions with the help of HSC cameras (Hyper Suprime-Cam) the Subaru telescope for about ten million galaxies.
Following the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 percent of the observation world’s energy mass, scientists, working in the framework of the standard Space model ΛCDM (Λ Cold Dark Matter), assessed the pace of expansion of the Universe, which was slightly slower than considered earlier.
In the press-release of the Observatory Subaru noted that observations allowed to get a detailed three-dimensional card of the distribution of the Mother in the Universe, and the account of the data of the European space telescope Planck specified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of the ΛCDM.
In July, scientists watched the possible death of the Universe.
The three years earlier their colleagues presented new arguments in favor of the fact that the observed world will cease its existence through 22 billion years as a result of a large gap.

В матче "Локо" - "Ахмат" ошибки Турбин сыпали, как из рога изобилия
The former judge of the All-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented the work of the arbitrator Evgeny Turbina in the match of the 9th round of the championship of Russia "Lokomotiv" - "Akhmata" and disappointed the controversial episodes of the game.
- Как оцениваете судейство Евгения Турбина в матче "Локомотив" - "Ахмат"?
- I believe that this arbitrator confirmed its inability to judge the matches of the Russian Premier League.
I wonder that the poles at the meeting of the fifth round "Spartak" - "Dynamo", neither Turbin itself nor the leaders of the DPI did not make serious conclusions about its low qualification.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private bands of gross receptions were played as of the horn of abundance.
For example, at the 50th minute of Eder's railway station is enchanted by the hand in his penal area of the defenseman "Ahмата" Rodolfo.
From the gate eight meters, but Turbine does not put the penalties.
- How you estimate the episode with the participation of Idov, who was at the 82-minute, when it seemed that the ball got him into the hand?
- I believe that there was a smart game of the defender’s hand in his penal area.
Turbine was located next to the moment, well sees this episode and its first assistant on the right.
This moment was to see and the reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all the three fell, and the penalties were not appointed.
Therefore, the score in the match is distorted, and the sports justice was changed.
This was the case when the action on the notions came out and buried the sports spirit of the game.
- On the 52-minute of Turbine didn't decide to remove the defender of the guests Oleg Ivanov who violated the rules in the fight against Krychoyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, showed him a demonstration.
What do you think about this episode?
Нужно было показать второй "горчичник"?
- In this moment Turbing and the first yellow card showed not quite a matter.
The second would have been unhological.

The US ministry of internal affairs is not police, but civil functions, including the policy in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinc’s statement was quite in the competence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, though it was not deprived of political circle.
Speaking at the industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinc said that thanks to the US military-marine forces control marine paths in the Middle East region and can lock them in case of necessity.
According to Zinc, the need may be related to Washington’s desire to prevent Russian supply to the global energy market.

For this purpose, Washington will have to force Russia and Iran, and the sea block of trade routes - acceptable measure on this way, says Zinc.

"Это безобразное кумовство"
Зрители возмущены выбором Агутина на шоу "Голос"
The audience of the show "Voice 60+" is accused of the instructor Leonid Agutina in the "irresistible mum and naked subway".
When in the blind listening he learned from the first night the voice of his father Nicholas Agutin many hoped that he would keep neutrality and do not believe to the performer.
But the sons of the feeling took the top, and he chose the relative to his team.
Then many have conceived this noise, but have forgiven the mentor of the injustice at the first stage.
But the "noise" затянулся, and the father of the star absolutely unrighteous took the place of more worthy performer.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutin such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience of the show, were excited by the mum of irreconcilable and frankly protesting their close relatives to the final staircase.
I have already doubted that Agutina praised the forces and conscience not to тащить until the end of his papu completely already to the first place,” said Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program "Man of TV".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father Leonid Agutin "merged" beautiful performer who really sang, while Nikolay Petrovich passed a tropical song about my mother, explaining that the audience and further want to see in his father's show.
But as it turned out, it is not so, the audience want objective evaluation and see in the ending really talented performer, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"I feel the participants of "Voice" from the team of Agutina - they were doomed".
"Last time Agutin showed how he loves the papu, and today had to show himself a professional".
"The contest lost its meaning".
"Remove from the project of two talented people and leave in the project of his popu who doesn't sing a sheepskin as soon as possible to call the mentor?"
"It's like a pope, arrange it a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert".
Это шоу "Голос", а не шоу "Крутые родственники".
"On the side of Agutina it was not офессионально".
"Then it is necessary for your own show to offer a papa, not on the show that is done for the money 1 Canal".
"This was a real chance for someone, and he took some place.
And I don’t understand why the irrevocable papa should cause me understanding more than any other participant with real legal data.
Why was the worker from Surgut with a great voice and darkness merged, and the papu Agutina brought to the ending?
And then we all regret that on stage and from screens are the same faces of decades!
Да потому что не пробиться сквозь кумовство!"
"What did you wait?
Это ж Россия!
Cross блат и кумовство.
Да и деньги в семейный бюджет будет не лишние!
Театр абсурда продолжается!"
The users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Golos" on blind listening came the son of Gradsky.
Then the subway and the head didn't come to take the son to his own team.
And he said, Come, go away, all understand.
Agutin to act as a professional couldn't.

Кемеровчан возмутило стадо баранов на кладбище
On September 30, the famous Kemerovo page in the social network appeared a message from the очевидца that one of the local cemeteries freely disperse the horn animals.
The inhabited little herd passed between the fence and pulled the grass.
Commentors expressed different opinions: someone from the local residents noted that there is no harm in the cemetery of the small cattle in the presence of small cattle, and their appetite can even help in the cleaning of the territory from the peasants and herbs of the grass, but some of the residents of the city did not have to behave in the soul:
"Это могилы , а не пастбище.
There is nothing to do with the drums.
Pro drums, of course, do not say that they are calm, but still not doing it." (style is preserved) - noted in their message a refurbished судровчанка.
Thus or otherwise, some of the witnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and in the near future the necessary measures will be taken.
Давлеть и довлеть - как правильно?
The words don't exist.
Правильно - доволеть.
The word "pressure" in the meaning of "pulling, influence, impact" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound instead of "happy".
We use this word, полагая, что оно происходит от слова "давление".
Но "давление" и "довольно" этимологично не только не близки, но и даже в каком-то смысле противоположны.
Make sure in this yourself.
To put (church-book, obsolete) - means "quite, fully enough, to be sufficient for someone or something to satisfy".
Довольствоваться, удовольствие - родные слова.
It was still the meaning of "not to depend on what, to have self-sufficiency" - "to be satisfied."
Старославянское "доволго" родно говорят "велеть" и "воля".
Давить, подавлять - совершенно другие.
These words are truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (giving sheep), deyja - "die" and dvaidī - "come close".
Similar phonetic appearance of words "pressure" and "happy" as well as a little fatigue of the latter, forced them to enter into the context.
So we have appeared this "d[a]вливать", which and in writing use through "a" that, in-good, incorrectly and impossible from the point of view of the processes of emergence and development of these words.
Итак, правильно - доволеть.
But this word is obsolete, in its correct meaning is not used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative influence over you, use the word "give" to you.
You can also use the "pressure" structure, but remember that it is a canцелярия.

Греция закрепит право на свое прошлое.
Ideal agreements are not.

But this decision will lead to negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in Balkans.”

Страна оказалась на распутье.
The choice, which will make the citizens of Macedonia, will determine the future not only of Balkans, but also Europe as a whole".
