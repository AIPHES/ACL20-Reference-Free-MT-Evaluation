Trump noted that Barack Obama's team has so launched relations with the DPRK that it could not even call the country's leadership - they simply didn't shoot the tube there.
Then the US and the DPRK were on the threshold of the war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House "excellent letters," Trump noted.
Trump admitted that Kim Jong-un was also "brutal" at the start of his work, which, however, was reciprocal.
However, now their relations have recovered to the extent that the leaders "fell in love with each other."
In doing so, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media will drag them down as incompetence.
Trump pointed out that Pyongyang has recently ceased nuclear and missile testing, as well as closed military ranges.
All of this is the service of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump loudly complained about Kim Jong-un from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
Meanwhile, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK will continue until the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

She shared her experience in maintaining the "Ukrainian-speaking regime" at a children's camp in Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the Watsons chain of bookstores by a court, a cashier of one of whom spoke to her in Russian.
Nice didn't get her own, and she twisted her hand into the girl.

"This difficult game turned out, a serious male conversation took place during the interval, and it yielded its results: They scored two goals and didn't miss.
"You missed several matches from-for the damage that was received at the beginning of the month.
How did I feel today? "
"If he survived 90 minutes, then everything is good!
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe, at the end, I took a bit of strength so that nothing happened.
And so, the doctor and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev have brought me to this game, for which they thank you very much!
"What will you say about the atmosphere in the team?"
"It's no secret for anyone that after victories it's easier to recover and the mood in the team is good.
Now we had a white band, though at first there was a black band.
It is necessary to continue in the same spirit and please fans. "
"Did you get into the game at a time that didn't go out on the field?"
"There's such, I've got a little boring because really, the unpleasant situation has come out.
But once again, thanks to the physiotherapist and doctors that they put on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and pleased fans.
But the rest of everything is secondary. "

Kosachev: At 73-th session of the UN General Assembly, Russia's topic in negative terms was virtually absent
The head of the Federation Council Committee for International Affairs, Konstantin Kosachev, considers the session of the UN General Assembly to be successful for Russia and does not rule out that it will be able to become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global problems.
"The understanding of the current 73-session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric we have almost become accustomed to in recent years against Russia has now been in order to be more stupid," the senator said in an interview published on Sunday by the "Russian newspaper."
He explained that, in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes "identified as one of the three main threats to humanity, then, along with the Ebola fever, then, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, in any case, in the statement of a group of Western countries, which spoke on this matter quite unanimously."
At 73-of the session, Kosachev stressed, "Russia's topic in negative terms was virtually absent."
"If I carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the German Foreign Minister, I now don't take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir wasn't entirely accurate," the politician drew attention, noting that Russia "was no longer a wall about which the blows train a tennis ball."
The head of the relevant committee of the Security Fed does not rule out that this indicates a trend that, in his opinion, "will allocate the current session of the [UN General Assembly], although this trend may be fully evident in a year, two to three."
"I don't rule out that the current session in what sense-could be turning," Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how Russia's engagement can move forward in international affairs."
As an example, he cited situations in Syria, Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," added the parliamentarian.
This is due to the fact, he believes that there is "an adequate, common perception of Russia as not just a possible - an integral participant in solving the global problems of modern times."
"I don't want to make a mistake, but I have the feeling that we, where-is going through a point beyond which the movement will no longer be reversed, it will be moving forward," he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
"I attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year ago ,-two or five years ago, the Russian view, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, no one was interested, then the situation is different now," said the Chairman of the Committee of the Council.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which embodies the West, has no answer to questions about how to solve world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, a lack of ideas about how to solve problems in the Middle East, problems of terrorism, problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, problems of migration."
"And here, the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that he believes in this sense "the current session is a good one for the Russian delegation, which is good for Russia."

AG became the second most popular in Germany
The Antiimmigrant Alternative for Germany scores another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings fall.
Soodya in all respects, German residents have started to seriously tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has made the country a cherished target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The most recent social polls say this, according to which the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party is becoming increasingly popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc, Merkel and Zeehofer, are weakening.
This week, AG scored another record, climbing the second line in the popular sympathy rating.
The right-wing conservatives, with 17-percent of popularity, managed to bypass the Socialist-- Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
One percentage point could be written off for statistical error, but one should not forget the fact that the AG, created in 2013, from a small group of economists ,-euroskeptics, had managed to become a serious political force.
The leadership in the overall standpoint has so far continued to hold the ruling CSU / CDU bloc, which has around 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points here - back in April, Angela Merkel's support for the bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also decreasing.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
It is a good idea that the democrats followed the Social-- by "green" (15%), left-wing (11%), and liberals (10%).
The "Alternative" Revolution
Alternative for Germany was founded in September 2012 on the basis of the group "Alternative Choice 2013," which included people from Christiansko-democratic union.
The Group initially entered the opposition in the government's course, but initially focused only on economic issues, including the euro and EU engagement.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of weak EU economies, and did not rule out the possibility of a return to the German brand and a complete exit from the European Union.
Against the backdrop of the deepening immigration crisis, the AG political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that took up the niche of euroskeptics and began to strongly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
At the last parliamentary elections in 2017, AG managed to first break into the Bundestag, having received 94 deputy seats (from 709).
Two representatives of "Alternatives for Germany" get seats in the European Parliament.

The term of death of the Universe is called
The universe exists for an additional 140 billion years, ten times the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The study of the international team of scientists has been published in the library of electronic preparers arXiv.org and has been published in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
To this conclusion, specialists came to watch the Subaru telescope over about a dozen million galaxies using the HSC camera (Hyper Suprime-Cam).
After monitoring the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 percent of the energy at-mass of the observed world, scientists, working under the CDM standard cosmological model (Cold Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which turned out to be slightly slower than previously thought.
The press-release of the Subaru Observatory notes that the observations made it possible to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the recording of data from the European Planck space telescope clarified the restrictions imposed on the CDM parameters.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the Universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments in favour of the fact that the observed world will cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Gap.
Another attempt was made to unite the initiators of the pension referendum
Ability to get to know the opinion of the people about pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the federal referendum initiative group against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups who registered different language of questions (the Central Election Commission registered five language formulations in total).
They decided to apply to the CEC for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians: "Do you want the age set by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, when citizens of Russia get the right to an old-age pension, not to raise?"
This wording was registered by a Vologda subgroup whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered to be the simplest and most legally binding language.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of Ilya Sviridov, a member of Just Russia (six subgroups) and the CPRF (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups joined them - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Rainer Sviridov told Vedomosti that invitations were sent to all the initiators, and about 40 subgroups agreed to arrive.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the volunteer subgroup (her wording was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that invitations were not received and did not plan to come: "We didn't understand who is a friend, but who is an enemy."

Turbin's mistakes fell asleep in the "Loko" - "Ahmat" match as a horn of abundance
Former All-Union judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of arbitrator Yevgeny Turbin in match 9-of the round of the Russian championship "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat" and dismantled the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess Yevgeny Turbin's referee in the Lokomotiv match - "Ahmat"?
- I believe that this arbitrator confirmed his unsuitability for judging the matches of the Russian premier ,-league.
I am surprised that at the fifth round of Spartak, Dynamo, neither Turbyn himself nor the leaders of the Department of Emergency Situations made serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result didn't slow down to say in the ninth round: Mistakes in his actions, private passes of brutal receptions fell asleep as out of the horn of abundance.
For example, at 50-the tenth minute of Edera's train, Rodolfo, Advocate "Ahmata," takes his hands in his punitive area.
At the gate eight meters, but Turbin does not put a penalty.
- How do you estimate an episode involving Idov, which was at 82-minute when it seemed that the ball hit him in his hand?
- I consider that here was a deliberate game by the defender's hand in his punitive area.
Turbyn was close to the moment, sees this episode well and his first assistant to the right.
This moment was also to be seen by the reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three fell asleep and no penalty was assigned.
Therefore, the score in the match was distorted, and the sports justice was wrong.
This was the very case when judging by concepts pushed and buried the sports spirit of the game.
- At 52-the minute, Turbyn didn't decide to remove the guest defender, Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Krykhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think about this episode?
Was it necessary to show the second "mustard"?
- In this moment Turbyn and the first yellow card showed not quite in business.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of refereeing that which-the teams are penalized for such violations as in an episode with Idov, and which-is not.
What do you assess the words of the footballer?
- Considering what to mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't give him.
In fact, the arbitrator does not give the second penalty to the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge looks at who plays.
Wot played on Saturday, Lokomotiv, and Ahmata has serious grievances for Turbin's work because the team was impaired.
Matt Damon played the raped Judge Kavano at the start of SNL
American actor Matt Damon played a U.S. Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kaavan, who is accused of rape.

I was the most proud, the most drunk virgin who was either-or when-or saw.
Everyone is familiar with this, "said Matt Damon.
Rainer Kavana was elected as the supreme judge of the United States.

The United States has thought about the naval blockade of Russia from-for oil and gas supplies
In the United States, a naval blockade against Russia could be launched to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
American authorities are so zealous in the struggle for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's leading suppliers of energy.
U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke told about the possibility of a naval blockade the day before.
In reproach of world practice, the American Ministry of Internal Affairs does not perform police functions, but rather civil functions, including the implementation of a policy in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke's statement came entirely within the competence of the agency headed by him, even though it was not deprived of a political race.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to militarily-US naval forces control sea routes in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary.
From Zinke's words, it was clear that the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the global energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives a lion's share of its revenues from supplies to the global oil and gas market at-.
The desire to distribute supplies of energy resources in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motivation for Moscow's revitalization in this region, Zinke is sure.
The minister made it clear that the U.S. at-still expects to provide leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to clarify Russia and Iran, and the naval blockade of trade routes - an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke believes.

I've just recently been interested in seeing him from outside.
I can't say I am a fan because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathies with Spartak and I want to apologize once again for the decision, "Terry quotes Chelsea's website.
Let us recall that Rostov with 18 points rose to third place in the tournament table, and Spartak placed on the fifth line, having 15 points in the asset.

Expensive violin handed over to pawnbard for a priceless
When a man brought a violin in in the town of Somerville (Massachusetts), a LBC Boutique and Loan pawnaker, a pawnard worker offered only $50 for an old and unprofitable instrument.
But Dilan Mcdermitt, an experienced store manager, suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and asked an expert for advice.
Tutat-then it turned out that the violin was produced in 1759 by renowned Italian violin maker Ferdinando Gallano and is estimated at 250 thousand dollars.
Only the links to the violin are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation found that the violin was not so long ago stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the tool was returned to the legal owner.
I don't know how the violin got to the person who gave it to the pawnard, but there are no previous clashes with the law.
The manager says now all those who bring the script into the pawn will be asked to play on it to make sure it really belongs to the customer.
In the ninth round of the RPL, we are waiting for an exciting confrontation: "Spartak" will take "Rostov" at its stadium in Tushin under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a person, as we know, absolutely not another "people's team."

Red-whites now have a difficult band: The club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, the team of Massimo Carrera unexpectedly pulled "Rapido," and recently lost home to "Ahmatu."
After the derby with CSKA, which ended with a fair draw, Spartak, with a minimal score and not without difficulty, beat in the Cup "Chernomorets," and it is too early to talk about whether the most popular club in Russia has come to an exit from the crisis.
Rostov could not win three matches in a row, but also didn't know defeats here already five matches.
Let's see if Carpin will be able to prolong the win-win series so principled to himself.
The preliminary meeting of Karpinsky "Rostov" with "Spartak" ended in favor of the capital's team.
The start is at 19: 00.

The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but few differences between them do not play a big role for mutual understanding.
This was announced on International Translator Day, September 30, by a professional translator ,-, synchronist, Bairbel Sakse.
She has been engaged in translations from Russian and English for more than 30 years.

Valery Belov, head coach of Vityaz, is about the defeat from Siberia (3: 4) in the regular KHL championship match.
"The College spoke about" Siberia "fans, and I want to note our fans," Belov quotes the official website "Vityazia."

"This is an unimaginable kumovaniya"
Zriters are outraged by the choice of Agutina at the show "Voice"
The slogans of the show "Volos 60 +" accuse the mentor Leonid Agoutina of "an unimaginable mouthpiece and a naked sketch."
When he heard the voice of his father, Nikolai Agoutina, from the very beginning in the blind wiretaps, many hoped that he would remain neutral and would not turn to the performer.
But the sons of the senses took the top, and he chose a relative to his team.
Then many considered this a joke, but forgave the mentor bias at the first stage.
But the "joke" was delayed, and the star's father absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more dignified performers.
And now viewers are not ready to forgive Agutina such injustice.
In the evening, we, the viewers of the show, were outraged by the kumovanie of the unimaginable and frank dragging of our close relatives onto the final staircase.
I even doubted that Agutina would have enough strength and conscience not to drag his father to the first place before the end, "Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina reasoned in the program" Man of TVs. "
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agoutin, "merged" fine performers who really sang while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that viewers still want to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, this is not the case at all, viewers want an objective assessment and see truly talented performers in the final, and now Agoutin has discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the participants of the Voice from the team of Augustin - they were doomed."
"Last time, Augustin showed how he loves his father, and today he had to show himself as a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"Remove from the project two talented people and leave in the project his father who doesn't sing but whisper, how can you call the mentor after that?,"
"Wake up as a dad sings, organise a concert in the Kremlin for your money and watch how many people will come to this concert."
This is the show "Voice," not the show "Circle Relatives."
"From Agutina's side it was unprofessional."
"Then it's necessary to offer a dad on his own show, not on the show, which is made for the money of Chana 1."
"It was a real chance for whom-that was, and he took whose place ,-.
And I don't understand why a neat dad should call me more understanding than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did a working man from Surgut, with a splendid voice and a timbre, merge and Dad Agoutina get to the final?
And then we all complain that on stage and from screens the same faces for decades!
Yes, because don't break through the kumovanie! "
"What did you expect?
It's Russia!
The Circle of bliss and kumovanie.
And the money in the family budget will not be extra!

Sergei Syrotkin: I couldn't do anything and it was very painful
Russian pilot of "Williams" Sergei Syrotkin commented on the outcome of the race Gran-under Russia.
"Frankly speaking, I don't really want to say that in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn I turned out to be between two cars that immediately took me.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, the moment, immediately.
I found myself in a very bad position.
I got stuck in traffic.
It was announced that after the rest go to the grill-stop, we will get into the "clean air," and the pace will return, but the rubber wasn't there anymore.
Plyus struggled with an aunt, and he was also in contact with him.
As I understand, he was slightly wrong.

Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is a naive foolishness.
I absolutely disagree with what Carrera is doing.
This only deepens the division of the team.
Wo-first, these are verses, read and perceive them as possible.
I would not have responded to it at the Carrara site.
Everyone, after all, has their own opinion.
Wo-second, everyone wants to bury.
If Glushakov and Yeschenko are put on the lakes, it doesn't mean they have that-then against the trainer.
I think the Italian lacks flexibility in perception of the situation.
And it doesn't serve the normal climate on the team.
Today, Spartak has no game, so it wasn't necessary to blow up this situation at all.
Maybe it was just together that it was worth laughing about it.
"Spartak" has a lot of things not in order in different lines, there is an inplay after the introduction into the youth.
Relations within the team seem not to add optimism before this match, "Tardigev is sure.
The Games of the two teams will take place on September 30 and will begin at 19.00 Moscow time.
Rainer, who refused to Spartaku, John Terry led Chelsea's youth team.
Sirius riots discussed similar technologies with environmental scientists
Residents of the Sirius Educational Center in Sochi, participants of the School of Agribiology and Plant Genetics, visited a lecture by scientists from the national research center "Kurchatov Institute."

Environmental technologies, which young scientists are currently working on, will help solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of environmental technologies, and also spoke about the risks that inevitably arise from the creation of such technologies.
"The advent of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a colossal benefit.
It is an explosive growth in medical technologies, it is an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is also a second side.
The development of environmental technologies is actually a technological reproduction of living nature systems.
There is a reverse side - a purposeful interference in the life of a person.
Risks are always.
A car appeared - people began to die under wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of the technologies immediately.
I create a medical new technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction, "the scientist of REN TV quotes.

Living non-small herds went between the fence and pulled out the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: Who ,-, from local residents noted that there was no harm in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery, and their appetite could even help in clearing the territory from weeds and herbs, but some of the residents of the city did not have to behave as follows:
"It's a grave, not a pasture.
There's nothing to be done to baranas there.
Prab baranov, of course, you won't say that they are predatory, but still it's not a matter. "(The style is preserved) - noted in her message the outrageous kemerovchanka.
Either way, who-then from eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and the necessary measures will be taken soon.
Let and get - how is it right?
The Word to give does not exist.
The right thing is to catch up.
The word "give" in the meaning "pull, influence, impact" exists only phonetically because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "catch."
We use this word, believing it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "catch" ethymologically are not only not close, but even in what sense ,-, are the opposite.
Try it yourself.
Dovlet (book church, outdated) means "enough, complete enough, to be sufficient for someone to-or what to-or to satisfy."
To keep up, pleasure is kindred words.
Ranche still had a meaning "not to depend on anything, to have a self-fulfilling meaning" - "to catch himself."
Staroslavyansky "dovlelets" are related to the words "lead" and "will."
Give, suppress - absolutely different.
These words, by-, are really terrifying "relatives": Daos - "wolf" (giving sheep), deyja - "die" and dvaidα - "oppress."
The resulting phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "catch up," as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter, forced them to embark on the continuum.
So we've got this very "d [a] to drive," which is also used through a letter, which, according to-good, is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
So, the right thing is to catch up.
But this word is outdated, in its proper meaning no longer used.
If you want to note which-or circumstances / people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word "press."
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember it's the office.

With the help of an operation in Syria, Russia has shielded itself from terrorists
Over the course of three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100 thousand terrorists have been killed, 85 thousand of them have been killed by the Russian space forces.
This was reported in connection with the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria by Viktor Bondaryev, former head of the Committee of the Federation Council for Defence and Security.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air lethal means: Aerospace forces carried out and continue to carry out all attacks precisely on terrorist targets.
According to Bondaryev, tens of thousands of terrorist objects have been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition storage, reinforcements and headquarters.
With the help of Russian air strikes, jihadists' defence was hacked - it became a decisive contribution to the promotion of Syrian government troops, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondaryev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including Islamic State (IG, banned in Russia) and Jabhat  -Nusra (banned in Russia).

And this is only about registered individuals, not including those who have not been identified, Bondaryev emphasized.
Most of them were trained and ready at any time to take weapons into their hands, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondaryev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant frontiers - otherwise this evil "would have poured on us."

The United States is pleased to see an increase in opiate production in Afghanistan
On September 26, a lot was said in Tehran about the sharp worsening of the situation in Afghanistan.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on Afghan territory, militants unleashed a real terrorist war against state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year has become a record year in terms of the number of bloody attacks that have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans, "Patrushev noted.
Afghanistan's ills started far from yesterday.
Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group, Al -Qaida (banned in the Russian Federation), which settled in Afghanistan.
It has not been a month since America and NATO allies launched a military operation there, "Enduring Freedom."
It was 17 years old.
The multi-thousand American contingent is still on Afghan soil.
But peaceful life is even more ghost than at that time.
American troops are caught behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As may be, they are buying off militants for money - they wouldn't be touched.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - the Taliban movement (banned in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% is for ISIS terrorists (banned in the Russian Federation).
But they are growing there quickly.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly what they did not have in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be happy with this.
It is also gratifying that, over the 17 years of the American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
There is a colossal growth in areas sown with opium poppy and multibillion-dollar profits.

Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia gets the right to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will consolidate the right to its past.
There are no Ideal agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises can not please absolutely everyone. "
The country's renaming is supported by the ruling Socialists ,-Democrats, headed by Prime Minister ,-, Minister Zoran Zaev.
The opposition is conservative opposition and the president of the country, Georges Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetina Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, headed by Zaev, is imposed outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, I will lose sovereignty.
It is obvious that there are countries that wouldn't want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans. "
Fai Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The election to be made by the citizens of Macedonia will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole. "
