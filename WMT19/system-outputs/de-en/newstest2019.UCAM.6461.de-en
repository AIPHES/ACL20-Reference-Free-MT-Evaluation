Yes, she wants...
"Beautiful Munich woman" to be born in 2018!
In the afternoon, another surprise awaits our candidates: They will not contest the romantic candlelight shoot in front of MY SOLARIS alone, but alongside Male model Fabian!
Hvar - flirting, flirting, seducing - no easy tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
However, the nine "Beautiful Munich" contestants in the shoot with People photographer Tuan deliver and brave the wind, gush and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shoot can be seen in the video:
DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that you get into a conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one way or the other in the way he said in his statement," Grindel said on the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" in the "Bild" newspaper.
Despite the months-long debate over the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-times national player Özil.
"I would have been delighted if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be the case,"Grindel said.
In July, the 29-year-old declared his resignation from the DFB team and justified it by saying that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready to talk to German coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it from football so that "when you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation hasn't come to fruition so far."
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 2.13pm, the Linz Fire Brigade was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line runs directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, the danger was in arrears.
The fire brigade left and found the hut in full fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and fire debris had to be cleared to the extent absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had plugged a battery into the shop at lunchtime.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire, as well as the cause of the fire, has yet to be determined.
However, it is likely to be considerable, as the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Angry mother fights back: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family in open street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32,"Herbie: Fully Loaded") has been live-streaming herself, as she apparently wants to take the children away from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ," which publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see "luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, Lohan can be seen getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
As the family flees from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of trafficking children.
She does not provide any evidence for all of this in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan can be heard saying in the video as she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently, she is trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses a slap.
In tears, the actress then affirms how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to take this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is designed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The "Mascot" lander will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Sulawesi death toll rises to more than 400
After the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there is talk of at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could rise even further.
Rescue crews have not yet entered the devastated areas, which are cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla CEO
In the beginning, it was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused a stir in stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car maker.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now they have both agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO is retiring from the board of directors, but he is allowed to remain chairman of the board.
British Conservative Party Congress
Sharply guarded - the Tories' party conference
Birmingham is becoming the scene of a power struggle.
The party conference will focus on foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference will be overshadowed by the row between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, on the front lines of former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
Referendum on a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over these name duplications for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on it this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("Der nicht") - meaning jair Bolsonaro.
A week before Brazil's presidential election, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is emerging as an anti-system candidate, leading the polls.
His fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the leftist Workers' Party.
Audi: 'Dieselgate' revamp takes longer than planned
"The diesel taskforce is still in place," Chief Development Officer Peter Mertens told the industry journal "Automobile Week."
In December 2017, Audi chief executive Rupert Stadler, who has been detained and given leave of absence, announced that the taskforce would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / gearbox combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in addressing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The taskforce was set up in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the automaker had made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
On Friday, the VW supervisory board postponed a decision on Stadler's future and intends to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of allowing the sale of diesel cars with false emissions levels after the emissions cheating became known.
In doing so, he knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
The company is currently headed by Chief Sales Officer Bram Schot as Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronner Stimme."
In principle, he sees a fall in demand for sedans such as the A6, A7 and A8 audio models, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electric mobility.
There are already 15,000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to head DFB
Mainz (DPA) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for DFB president again next year, despite criticism of his person following the World Cup exit and the Özil affair.
"I'm doing my job and I'm trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said as a guest at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early Sunday morning.
You have to keep trying for re-election, I will do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "want to work on the future project" after the bid for the Euro 2024 football championship.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016, succeeding Wolfgang Niersbach, who was ousted over the summer fairytale affair.
In the autumn of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, Philipp Lahm, the future head of the European Union, will be working in the DFB's Executive Committee.
"I would like to see my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will continue to advise in this role in the Bureau and then, of course, be cordially invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to be involved in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migrant background should become an integration ambassador for the DFB.
Currently, the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic hold this position, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says," The issue is important, we have to take care of it,"it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Take off properly with a half-clever scales
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that measures not only my weight, but also my body fat percentage.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the sausages.
He doesn't say anything about whether I have replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear kick-off successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has kicked off the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up easily won with 112:55 (52:31) and played a convincing match for more than 40 minutes.
New entrant Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The Ludwigsburg-based national player Johannes Thiemann (18 points) also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators on his mandatory match debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg on the debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis.
Augustine rubit was the best thrower among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni scored 14 points.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Giants Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter in coach John Patrick's team with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a significant success.
At the Basketball Lions in Braunschweig, there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings topped the Oldenburg team with 25 points.
Braunschweig, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run by the Baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship,"he said.
The city centre of Cologne was partially closed for the opening of the Ditib mosque.
Several thousand police officers were deployed - including snipers.
The Ditib Islamic Association has been criticized for being an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, cries and scare
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and cardi B have campaigned for greater engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Get involved wherever you can," Mendes told around 60,000 spectators at the festival on Sunday night.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B stepped out in a red outfit with fringes and a gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid agencies, also showed up on stage during the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a scare when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was gunshots, got scared and tried to flee.
Shortly afterwards, panic arose and people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, organiser Hugh Evans said.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed people down from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You are all safe.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet.
If you wanted to get one, you had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
There were cheers and applause from the audience for the numerous musicians and actors - but boos for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He, along with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke out on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake endorsed the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice in the US Senate Judiciary Committee, upsetting many women.
At least three women have come forward with allegations of abuse, including attempted rape, against Kavanaugh, which he denies.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who claim to have experienced sexual assault themselves, confronted him in an elevator on the way to the committee meeting.
"You can also get together with me in an elevator at any time," Flake told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: German government defends journalist's ejection
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist, who lives in Hamburg, was wearing a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and was in the front row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert told Bild am Sonntag.
There was a disturbance in the course of the press conference.
The journalist's actions have caused a great deal of disquiet, which is unacceptable.
He had therefore caused people's guards to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, a large number of journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership of banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: It was only at the beginning of September that the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel have caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but trials are still underway in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht," produced by the NDR, is known for humid conversations at the counter of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten."
Presenter Ina Müller and her guests come across a lot of beer, some wine or even high-percentage drinks in order to lighten the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities are also bracing themselves for the obligatory singing.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time around: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Men's Hearts," "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Host Day."
However, the trip to the far north was not good for Munich.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumpled on it, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not ill, he only has a powerful hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not entirely serious - insights he has now gained: "Rule one: Never go to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sow.
And spritz.
And the round of egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half past three, also leaves.
The 43-year-old is truly in the face of alcohol consumption.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - presumably most purposefully - headache pills.
Others were simply amused by the sight of the normally attractive cinematographer.
It is not yet known how Ina Müller survived the nighttime shooting.
However, since she has been hosting the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to contend with vandalism and indecency.
The entrance to the 36-kilometre long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and littered.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are scarcely emerging.
Shards, cigarette butts, rubbish and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
A more than disgraceful sight for the flagship railway bike path in Rotkäppchenland.
The topic has been a long-standing concern for members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt, as well as others, according to the city's cycling commissioner, Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The issue has already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Council.
So far, there is no solution.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste bins and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the issue to the local council.
It's not just the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, but it also destroys the floors: Posts are torn out of the ground, rubbish bins are demolished, signs are buckled around, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
However, the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is the meeting place for Saufgelage.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "This may set the threshold significantly higher for grabbing public property.
However, this would require a police patrol to pass in a timely manner.
As a matter of principle, Wüstenhagen wants the Haaße hill to develop.
It must be made more attractive.
You can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
Tourism marketing can still be expanded.
Our bike path is very high quality compared to others in Germany,"said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa to be an extremely critical hazard.
There is no turning lane on the Haaße hill.
In the event of heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between the two sides of the road,"she explains.
This is not a problem for athletes, but it is a problem for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest at the cultural station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in togetherness.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "Music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family gathering for coffee and cake from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a longtime Albanian living in Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colors," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not seen this before in other parts of the city.
What were the lyrics connected to?
The towns of Hiltruper See and Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his striking song.
The cultural station was also honoured.
Time and again, it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
For example, Humberg was told that he had actually studied chemistry, but was now also teaching guitar.
Franke knew from sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the programme.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has put all sorts of things on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favourites of the jury, however, there was something special - so that others could listen to their songs as well.
An entire CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hitter, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "A very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again for the final - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KVG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the city's district offensive.
The city council offensive launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She regarded the event as a complete success.
All were "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon to be very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which - the old trick with the red foil - can only be deciphered once you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side will not be able to read anything by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Dice.
4."Feast."
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on.
It is not the terms that are to be guessed, but the codes.
Alternately one player per team is the encryption.
He gets a code card that says "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto," it is not the terms behind the secret film that are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice," "feast" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, as far as possible, win the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encoder notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice,"lots" as opposed to feast; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible, and "Prague" because he was watching at school and knew the window fall there.
That's how it goes round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but you can rhyme them better with any hint the encryption gives there.
So the rewrites should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, otherwise you will make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rulebook.
The players will probably have to study it in detail for quite a long time before they can finally play.
The explanatory video on the web at decrypto.info makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however,"Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre primus "Codenames," which also puts an agent's thesis on a game with fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you're only interested in rates and not winning points, you can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harassing guests in pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate twice in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler salute in the Upper Town to a passing police patrol, then later he also fell asleep in a pub in the Upper Town when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholic and failed to comply with the police's request for a place, he had to spend the night in the detention centre at the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate.
In a sober state, he will also have to face criminal charges for using the registration plates of unconstitutional organisations.
The Pressig plant was home to the drawers.
The railway plant in Pressig has been the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history came to an end.
"When buffers hit the buffers, you heard it all in the press," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't excite anyone.
The brakes squeaked and the wagons crawled.
That was pure railroad.
Statements that are emblematic of Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain range to the north, which, after a rise of about 220 metres in height, has its peak in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, train and drawer locomotives used to be needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotives, an apprentice workshop, a railway station and a railway station.
"The centrepiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and professional railway worker for 47 years.
The Pressig railway station, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - NordHalf.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam engines and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimised the need for train and drawer locomotives.
From 1977, they were only used for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10,000 weights were still ranked in the month.
Parts of the plant were demolished in 1982 and the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we did not envisage a better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport."
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig on the anniversary of "50 years of electrification in Nuremberg - Saalfeld."
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, the demise.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were pulled out, and the Pressig Ranging Station was history.
"The rangers and inhibitors did the most difficult work on the train," recalls Dinkel.
Any wrongdoing would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen railway station has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places, and many other historical and current images can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening win at China Open
Beijing (DPA) - Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing, as Julia Görges has done before.
Kerber won the China Open 6-2, 6-2 against Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent in the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa of Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6-3, 4-2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian, ranked number 13, gave up.
The sister-in-law is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened at the weekend as part of the "Art and Pleasure" series.
It was with great relief that organisers and visitors registered the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the Dahlmann-Schmidt estate in Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Pleasure."
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now on display in Mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the opening ceremony.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
As did Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organiser and artist.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with a good perspective on the future.
Both have already played an active role in the selection of artists in the past and have helped design flyers.
Once again this year, on the occasion of Art & Pleasure, there is a special 70-cent stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen," designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical setting.
Walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realises that the title "Windspiel Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and, in the end, playfully expresses it.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with coloured accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the "lucky tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau, awaits the visitor on the right.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully equipped with 20 wind turbines, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object looks fairytale and invites you to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental, who prefers to dedicate 15 years of K & G to the event in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts that are moving in the wind.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child."
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows off his colorful fantasy structure of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel Performance" invites you to wander through the multifaceted art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 albums: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
At the time, the Albanians also expressed their displeasure.
At least five of them.
They did not want to come to terms with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more singing in the district.
It has now become a legend: On a bench in the Tinnenbusch, they baptized the MGV 68 albums.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary has been celebrated in the "House of Encounters."
"It's going to be full today," Chairman Jürgen Holstiege guessed, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanian singers.
They had resurrected the foundation festival specifically for the anniversary.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
It was an elegant ball, festive clothes had been asked for before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Encounters," but sat comfortably at tables.
In between, there was a lot of movement: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled on the controls and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 albums themselves made the voice sound.
In keeping with the occasion, cheerful songs were announced.
Almost set: "Such a day, as beautiful as today."
In keeping with the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheim wine."
Alluding to another cool drink,"Humulus lupulus" resonated, which is the Latin term for "hops."
Again, the choral direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time, was sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said,"He has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece that he accomplishes." By the way, this time it wasn't just men who were singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had been sitting at his desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas WINTERHOFF also presented fine sounding poetry.
There was also a large raffle.
The proceeds will be used to fund a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd Women's League: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The ascendant marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of USC Münster, under the auspices of Axel Büring, is well placed in League Three.
No trace of shyness or fracking, the independents are doing their thing.
And that was really good at the 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee.
"It was not crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied."On the contrary.
In the evening, at a later birthday party by RONJA de Boer, the mood was good, the game ticked off.
Yes, the result is, in fact, an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they get it to the finish line, a game like this can be overturned," Büring knows from years of experience.
After all, USC made everything clear with its skilled power and brought the full yield to the finish line.
"We are all aware of who is on the other side in such a derby.
This does not break our heart.
I've seen really good volleyball in phases,"Annacker hadn't finished with 0:3 - and immediately moved on to the agenda.
It seems impossible to predict where the trip will go for the independents after just three days of play.
"It's just too early to do that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an unbelievably good level.
This is not nearly comparable to regional league volleyball."They don't want to look down on the fourth league anyway.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they will have to look up.
However, a first assessment can only be made after ten or eleven matches.
On Saturday we will go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will take part in Essen on 14 October.

Trend sports set a record number of visitors in Braunschweig over the weekend
The city centre on Saturday is full and rare.
On Sunday, there are only a few remaining parking spaces in the city's car parks.
City marketing is reporting a record number of visitors.
The trend sports weekend has been the best advertisement for the shopping town of Braunschweig.
A highly attractive framework programme played a significant part in this.
Trend sports weekend, so far, has meant that BMXers and skateboarders are getting their money's worth.
Four injured after accident at intersection in Hildburghausen
Four people have been injured in an accident.
According to previous information, a driver had failed to observe the other driver's driveway on Coburg Street just before noon on Sunday.
The cars collided.
The four injured were taken by ambulance to a hospital.
There were traffic disruptions.
The cars had to be towed away.
Emergency services from the Hildburghäuser Fire Brigade cleared the scene of the accident.
Glider crashes - flight pupil fatally injured
The pilot died in the crash of a glider in Essen.
The single-seater plane crashed into a parking lot not far from Essen Mülheim Airport on Sunday afternoon when it landed, a police spokesman said in Essen on Sunday.
The parking lot next to Highway 52, which is normally used for shuttle traffic to the fair, was largely empty, and other people were not injured in the crash.
Emergency responders continued to look after flight students and eyewitnesses at the scene.
In the immediate vicinity was the venue for an Oktoberfest, where numerous guests were expected in the evening.
The cause of the crash was initially unclear - the weather was good, there was light wind and sunshine.
Essen Mülheim is a small airport, much used by pilots with light private planes.
About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the "Dream Ship."
Now she talks openly about the fact that the series may have been complicit in her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went on board forever.
The series, which made her a star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929-2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many colleagues I admired perceived me on an equal footing,"Keller says in an interview with" Bild am Sonntag."
At first, she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "Dream Ship."
For now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much."
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time may well have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans also shunned conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried to be "the only right person" for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
This means in good German: I have changed my mind,"she explains.
She always felt she was "not good enough for him."
He saw in me an emancipated woman who, in truth, I never was, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again,"although I was afraid it could go wrong for a second time."
The day before the civil ceremony, I sat in the dressing room howling and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why did it never work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love at the time "as in the film."
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have been far too naive in my approach to love."
The nightwatchman, who regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ department of Zurich, has this time ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our wrinkle is not a moth, but a little shy of light.
And the glaring splendour in which a green carpet is submerged on Sichseläutenplatz dazzles him for a fee.
But it's just a film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening, he torches across the square to make himself a little easier in the "AquaClean WC Oasis."
This is the name of the public toilet system sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: The needy facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion is making a lot of effort to create a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks to the sky in the Men's Oasis for some reason.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who have just entertained the opening film "Green Book" at the best level in the cinema next door, celebrate the start of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store, as they do every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: It is well known that the works shown come from all over the world.
What do you not have to come up with in an article about this festival in order not to fall into sneaky advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The folder binds a bundle around the feelers, which has a good fairy attached to it, and two bulky doormen actually wave it in generously.
Inside, the invited crowd, they dance to live music well after midnight, or let the DJ pretend rhythms to which they shout at each other, and rinse down exquisite appetizers with cucumber.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters wait for their mouths to slip, next door, the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly sliced and a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: All the shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studies the sign on the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator."
If these are two separate instructions, he has lost himself in the dress code.
But it is more of a conditioning structure, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the upstairs housewares section, the poultry flips a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye," matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting this brand for years, is not here for the evening either.
But there is a face that is familiar to the observer, between the local celebrity, the box office table and kitchen items: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His lead actor is unlikely to be far behind.
And really: Right away, Viggo Mortensen, almost like a choir boy at the age of sixty, walks through the crowd.
It is not squashed, it is not confiscated, it is stolen at most.
International stars love this film festival, especially for this restraint, which is often misunderstood as a clampdown.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team's victory.
Argentina football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled in well in his new home country of Mexico.
After a 2-0 win at his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cab to Cumbia-Rythmen, as seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, booed by the players.
The Mexican second-rower defeated the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona shouted in a TV camera,"Always with my guys, always."
The 57-year-old has been training with the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Association League 1: ASV 'destroyed on the ground' after last-minute bust
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association list ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat." His protégés were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bust - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
They had not played badly - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - for long periods, the Sendeners.
Only the initial phase "we fell asleep," the ASV trainer was annoyed.
The hosts quickly led by 8:1, and the early break that Bieletzki had taken was not fruitful at first.
"But then all of a sudden a jerk went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the gap was only two goals.
In particular, Senden's best man, Marius Hintze, hit the stage once and for all.
After the change, things got even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalised at 15:15, followed by the relay changer almost throughout.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still a seemingly reassuring three (29:26).
And then?
The impartial intervened.
Bieletzki is usually wary of trying to blame others.
But: The 120-second penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff received was "a joke."
Lit had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the depleted ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood up well at the back against seven men and kept throwing at the empty goal.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now it's time for a damn victory," said Bieletzki, who was completely in charge.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (Hof County), police are searching for the woman's remains.
Forces dug up a road near Marxgrün on Saturday.
In addition, the pavement and several layers underneath were removed, as police and prosecutors jointly announced.
According to new evidence, the missing person may have been buried not far from where she lived at the time.
The woman has been missing since 4 November 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the criminal police in Hof, together with the public prosecutor's office, have been working intensively on the case again, according to the data.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Heritage Protection Agency, the investigators came across a conspicuous underneath the road near Marxgrün using a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, officials limited the site to a few metres.
The results of the excavations should be announced in the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking on the web.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should use passphrases to secure their accounts on the network.
In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, and it does not hurt to equip computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his impending resignation as chief executive of the billionaire company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settled a lawsuit out of court over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla will each pay $20 million, and Musk will also serve as chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German chairman of the supervisory board.
On the other hand, he may remain chief executive.
In the settlement, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager in the US Federal Court in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of any guilt.
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was saddened and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock market, paying $420 per share if the funding was secured.
As a result, Tesla would have been valued at a total of $72 billion.
Musk later backtracked: Tesla remains on the stock market.
Following the agreement, Tesla will now have to find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members and also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team 1-1 at Chelsea
Liverpool went on to win 1-1 at Chelsea.
In the top game at Chelsea, the attacker, who had just been replaced by coach Jürgen Klopp, scored 1:1 (0:1) in the 89th minute.
After six wins at the start, Liverpool fell to second place.
Chelsea remain third, with Manchester City the new front-runner.
Eden Hazard gave Chelsea the lead in the 25th minute with his sixth goal of the season.
After that, the Klopp team missed the equaliser several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger cleared the line after a solo goal by Liverpool's goalscorer Mohamed Salah (31).
Shortly before the end, Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a slumber into the corner.
Record champions Manchester United are slipping deeper and deeper into crisis after their worst start to the season since 1989.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United with 1:3 (0:2) and remains only in the table midfield with ten points after seven days of play.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match against FC Valencia.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made his first Premier League appearance after an injury to Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League match at Hoffenheim in 1899 on Tuesday, Manchester City won 2-0 against Brighton & Hove Albion with goals from Raheem Sterling (29) and Sergio Agüero (65).
Leroy Sané made it 1-0, Ilkay Gündogan was not used in the new front-runner.
"Let's Dance" juror Joachim Llambi and wife Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi has probably separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known for the RTL show "Let's Dance."
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhalinhalt) reports on the separation of the well-known presenter and dance expert, citing Llambi's lawyer.
"Our clients have separated amicably and amicably," said the lawyer, Christian Oliver Moser, according to "BamS."
The most important thing for them now is the welfare of their two daughters.
According to the report, the couple met in a pizzeria in 2003 and married two years later.
Joachim Llambi is from Duisburg and was a successful tournament dancer and stockbroker.
Llambi became known on television for his jury work on the celebrity dance show "Let's Dance" on RTL, as well as for his various appearances on quiz and entertainment shows.

Polls: 46% do not want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
After the squabbles of the past few weeks, the GroKo poll has received several lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a poll - Angela Merkel is seen as critical.
Berlin - The AfD overtook the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday trend for the Bild am Sonntag.
In the weekly poll conducted by the polling institute, the AfD is up by one count to 17 percent, the SPD is down by one point compared to the previous week and is down by 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lose one count and only get to 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union so far on Sunday.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 percent and the FDP 10 percent.
If a federal election were held on Sunday, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU would get only 43 percent of the vote, according to Emnid.
As a result, the grand coalition has now lost the majority on the Sunday question in all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently get 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 federal election, they received a combined 53.4 percent.
There is also a wide range of other parties: The AfD, the second strongest party in several polls, is 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens have a vote share of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left stands at an average of 10 percent and the FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an upward and downward uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent, depending on the share of the vote.
But support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) among the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens think Merkel is the right person in the chancellor's office, according to the Emnid poll commissioned by BamS.
According to the poll, only one in two (50 per cent) currently want the grand coalition to hold a general election in three years' time, with 41 per cent in favour of a new election.
Another poll published on Saturday also showed a significant drop in popularity for Merkel.
The Germans are also divided on whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, while 44 percent are against.
As a result, 64 percent of Union supporters do not want to stand, while 35 percent do not.
Hang out at Aldi: Reduced price to love happiness
Will Aldi become tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in times of tinder, there are no more romantic connoisseur stories - you should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by tinder and Co., the supermarket, as a place for connoisseurs of great love, exudes an almost anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer's short bargains at the volley table, or favourite pudding, is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The tinder app has a reputation for being not so much a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We took the test: How do women react when you don't talk about the hot bush for a long time in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
It has real Hollywood Lovestory potential when love happiness is preceded by an eye-catching and rediscovered plot.
If the guy then also registers at the e-mail address bio-turkey meat @ gmx.de with his offers, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
For example, in an Aldi branch unknown to us, the author of this advertisement may well wish that she would find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat."
In any case, she has earned her happy ending à la Hollywood for believing in the magic of analogue getting to know each other.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgerischule has been taking part in the action "Lid against polio - 500 lids for a life without polio."
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polio viruses.
The condition, referred to in German as polio, leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered to have been eradicated, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
Until now, the cause of poliomyelitis, the polio viruses, can only be curbed by vaccinations, according to a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc call for calm for idols
Leverkusen (DPA) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about the form and fitness of Mario GÖTZE.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
This is not good for the boy.
And that's not good for us,"said Reus, who was friends with GÖTZE after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen on Sky TV.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (DPA) - Manager Max Eberl of the Bundesliga football club Borussia Mönchengladbach is in no hurry to sign a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We have not even talked about a treaty yet.
There is no fixed date when we do it.
"But there will certainly be the moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl said on Sky TV on Sunday evening.
Football: District league: VfL Wolbeck's performance against SC Altenrheine is encouraging
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went hard on the court with his teammates.
Word-for-word, he, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, retired first (internally) to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
Everything is history.
In the meantime, it is running around the Brandhoveweg again.
The 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine is a testament to the success of the game, which has only been skinny in the past season.
Yes, I'm very happy with the performance.
"We made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen,"Fetsch praised his boys and asked each individual for the match, simply to say" thank you "for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came for him - the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly moved into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited in front for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first leg.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs missed the lead before his exit (17th), the changed Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th).
Almost that would have been revenge when the SCA struck twice in the 41st minute in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his field.
After the break, the VfL happily took full control.
Thewes from 18 metres narrowly failed.
Schroer, too, came too late after 58 minutes when Thewes came in.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch again missed a fresh cell cure on the left.
When Altenrhein's Chris Naberbäumer felled Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free-kick for the placegetters 18 metres in front of the guest house.
The foul-mouthed man stepped on his own and demonstrated his dangerousness to standards.
Westhues "thing with the right slap hit the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
Another 20 minutes, which should be damn long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck unhappily flipped the leather in the penalty area in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to survive a few minutes in the closing stages before Geske had the winning goal on the puck from 12 metres in the 87th minute.
Perhaps it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4-1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five days of play - that was not enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure their first home win.
Striker Ante Rebic, who was in the starting line-up for the first time after an injury, should help.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also back after suffering a hamstring injury and, with his head ball strength, should prevent the SGE from scoring more goals by standards.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
On landing, the accident occurred at the airfield.
The four occupants were slightly injured.
At around 2pm on Sunday there was a drama at the airfield in Kottingbrunn.
There was turbulence when a helicopter landed, police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was struck by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a halt on the side.
The police, rescue and fire brigade were immediately notified.
The forces arrived at the scene of the accident on a large scale.
The ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
The occupants were only slightly injured.
Luckily, it all turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only material damage.
The four occupants were only slightly injured and were able to return home on their own.
The exact circumstances surrounding the accident have not yet been clarified and are under investigation.
According to fire brigade spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire, but it was quickly extinguished.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on company boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female as of 1 September, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture," which will be officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was presented to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to set themselves up differently, otherwise the international competitors will move past them," said Wiebke Ankersen, managing director of the foundation.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, man-made management teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
In comparison, the gap makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
In addition, the slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies was due solely to positive impulses among the companies in the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright data, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
The proportion of women in the 30 Dax companies - which have led the way in recent years - has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit more women in the coming year - in their own interests," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement have signalled that they will continue to make no commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
A different picture emerges from the supervisory boards: As of 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"If just as many women were recruited to the boards every year, a 40 percent share would have been achieved by 2023," the report says.
Some even make a mess: Luxury cars: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserve the best.

Those who make the most profit per car among the noodle suppliers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
This question has been addressed by "Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros with each car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, and Tesla and Bentley are even putting a lot of money into each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the running with prices ranging from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in earnings before interest and tax EBIT.

The tourist association opened its wine festival session in Abtswind with a torchlight train.
For the 60th time, the association will host the wine festivals, which will henceforth take place every Saturday in October in the large marquee on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, the people in charge walked through the town to the festival square under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn.
The president of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the marquee, which is already full of props."To host something like this for 60 years - this is a madness for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that,"Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later symbolically kicked off the stage with the guests.
"It's nice that so many people have found their way back to us after the downwind." Later,"The Troglauans" caused a sentiment.
On Sunday, when Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon, the club had set drinks prices as they did 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival will take place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before the second round will take place in the marquee a day later.
In Bonn: Emergency medical helicopter crashes into taxi
An ambulance is standing next to a road, badly damaged.
A 27-year-old passer-by was fatally injured in the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they are supposed to help - best of all, save lives.
Such a rescue mission came to a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in the collision of an emergency car with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car crossed a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue lights and martinshorn.
He then collided on an intersection with the taxi, which was travelling in green.
The doctor's car slammed against a traffic light pole and a tree after the collision.
He captured the passer-by, who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were seriously injured and trapped in their vehicles and had to be freed by emergency services.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but she was unable to help the pedestrian.
Another emergency physician called in from the hospital tried to do so - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn prosecutor's office, are investigating who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, we find it uncomfortable for Mourinho
Manchester United are now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League after their embarrassing relegation in the league.
Against West Ham United, ManU are 1-3. The manner of the defeat is likely to be a talking point.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute, when the recovered Marko Arnautovic scored for West Ham 3-1, just three minutes after Marcus Rashford supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside on Mark Nobel's pass, all of Manchester's defenders stood still and allowed Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of a previously unsatisfactory performance over a long period of time.
At the moment, the mood is very different for United's city rival Manchester City.
The Citizens, trained by Mourinho's great competitor Pep Guardiola, scored against Brighton & Hove Albion in an unendangered 2-0 win.
After half an hour Raheem Sterling broke the defensive barrier for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalscorer, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus the leap to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer top of the table
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the league cup, Xherdan SHAQIRI won a 1-1 draw with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As with the Cup exit, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in the London derby.
The 27-year-old's goal in the 25th minute remained the only goal of the game until the closing stages.
SHAQIRI, who came on for Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute, narrowly missed the equaliser after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his hat-trick.
So, after the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea could not be beaten for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and the rematch in the league saw the Blues knock Liverpool off the top of the table.
Like City, the two London City clubs, Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford), also celebrated 2-0 victories.
However, the Gunners fans, with Granit Xhaka playing through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a message of success against the surprise team from Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unhappily busted Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to their fifth consecutive win and are now just behind big rivals Tottenham in 5th place. A strong impression continues to leave Wolverhampton ascendant under their Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten in the league for the fifth time in a row in the 2-0 win over Southampton, finishing 8th.
VW's core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show in the wake of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue, but ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the fight over driving bans and retrofits should not let the German car companies go at the industry meeting in Paris.
From next week, they will be showcasing their new products at the 2018 Motor Show in the French capital, together with competitors from all over the world.
Diesel doesn't really matter much anymore.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, are still likely to be an important topic, at least behind the shiny scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and, among other things, have their first pure electric models: The Ingolstadt e-tron is due to be launched at the end of the year, and the Stuttgart EQC in 2019.
However, both have already been officially presented.
BMW's iNext is not due to start until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3 Series.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were just over a million visitors.
At least 380 people have died in the severe earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second a magnitude of 7.4.
Communication and transport links have been damaged and enormous damage has been caused to property.
After the quakes, the tsunami hit the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds gathered on the beach for a party.
It is feared that the number of victims will rise significantly.
So far, the figures have only come from Palu.
But many other communities - along Sulawesi's west coast - are also affected.
About 150 bikers celebrate the service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral care of the PS-strong two-cyclists.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (Mogo) will always take place on the last Sunday of the month at Haus Nordhelle.
Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
On Sunday, around 150 bikers gathered there to celebrate a service that was far from ordinary.
As early as 10 a.m., the cars were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker's early shopping was on the agenda and it was allowed to be fortified with coffee and cake or even with a savoury curry sausage.
In addition to the Mogo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
Pastor Dirk Grzegorek gave the sermon during the biker service.
The singer-songwriter Valerie LiLL provided the musical backing.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie LiLL sounds rather poetic and calm," says Father Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a big feast: After the apple comes the milk.
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of the action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his astonished spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could have imagined how it would turn into a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step in their work late on Friday afternoon.
Wrapped in moulds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which look a little like crockery, layer by layer on top of each other.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step of the work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the farmer from Füchtorfer also had already finished bottled specialties.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest feather whites to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents got in touch, while the children were not only able to follow the process of pressing the apple, but also discovered the bouncy castle they had built up for themselves.
Active members of the Füchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers also took part in the festival and invited them to take part in entertaining games at some stations.
The local club will also be offering a day of action next year.
But then, as Gregor Krützkamp pointed out, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place to be.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the issue: After all, it will be all about milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season bust: "Shitty situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth consecutive Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
However, there was not much to see before in the 1-4 (0-2) final of the table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," said 96-year-old footballer Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "It's disappointing, of course, because you always take a lot of action."
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86) joined, are at the bottom with two points and are a runner-up in their current constitution.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated its first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio in Rome, moved into the middle of the table with seven points.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action by Hesse in his starting debut and never got to grips with Hanover's defence.
The striker, who has been struggling for a long time after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was also in the initial formation of the Frankfurt club for the first time.
A header deflected onto the goal net by Lucas Torró (17) put him in danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller, in a promising position, was stopped at the last moment by the 96-man defence around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-handed Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords was almost inevitable and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a deflected corner, Haller extended his header in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga match for the defender, who arrived in the summer from French second-tier side AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt slumped before the break.
This time, Haller matched up with his Storm partner Rebic, who skilfully kicked and left 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser with no chance.
In the second half Hanover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought in two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played a bit more courageously forward, but igniting ideas remained until just before the end, when the final result was achieved.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After less than an hour Rebic started a solo and then put the ball across to De Guzmán, who had only to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was just a show run for the Frankfurt fans against overstretched guests, and Jovic also hit a minute before the end.
Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter, made it in front of millions of people at the opening of the 185.
Munich's Wies'n won by two strokes last week.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross feast
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross feast on 14 September or on Sunday afterwards.
The festive service will take place in the town church, followed by a procession to the Church of the Holy Cross with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross is home to Christ, who was shot dead in the 30-year war and is believed to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood then flowed from the gunshot wound.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
It has not been completed to this day, only the altar room is standing, the lack of a long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Rev. Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
The service was poorly attended, despite its importance to the Geisinger parish.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place, and with the final blessing, the ecclesiastical part of the celebration of the Cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting people to the Catholic parish home for the secular part of the festival.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted to the farm party.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the town church, and Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger, on behalf of the parish, informed visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction work, which will continue into next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage has been identified more precisely and the individual tenders have been prepared more specifically.
What is certain is that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that already existed a few years ago has increased, but more has also been discovered, which was only made possible by the appearance of the scaffolding.
The plastering work has been completed, natural stone work is due to begin before winter, and it is hoped that more than half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New home in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life support Donau-Iller is opening a new home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that "a very special house" will now be handed over to its destination in Münsterblickstraße - all those present agreed at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the home of the life support company Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas in his concept.
The first planning began around eight years ago, when the former US Army officer's building was put to the test for residents with a mobile phone cap: "The house had come into the years and was no longer up-to-date in the equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators arrived to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed to be as friendly and bright as possible, so that residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life support Donau-Iller opens new home
Life support invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, while the district of Swabia contributed 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money.
The managing director of life support, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy.
However, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which allowed the residents to experience the freedom to move without foreign help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, the head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, said similarly: "The house is geared to the special needs of its residents, who need help to be mobile."
At the same time, the comfort and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And he added: "The property in this situation is a real stroke of luck, because it is no longer available in the current situation."
In total, the new residential home in Münsterblickstraße offers space on almost 1500 square metres for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three residential groups.
Heinz, managing director of life support, is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed on a tariff basis.
Germany: Sister laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the deputy leader of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to all compatriots not to come to terms with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences,"the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the Tagesspiegel on Sunday.
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans, on average, worked longer than people in West Germany, but were paid 15 percent less.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unification," Sister said.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is said to smooth the tide between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae-In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs as a gift.
According to Moon's office on Sunday, the two dogs, who are about a year old, reached their destination on Thursday.
They then passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food in order to "make it easier for the animals to get used to."
The dogs, with their thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes, are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions, such as the 2020 Olympics, and to jointly compete for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile propulsion.
Austria's Moving History in the Mirror of 99 Documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published, most of which answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it very differently in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to work in kind - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the grand coalition, which begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have invoked the "return to work in kind" mantra.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to ask the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and non-work, but let's face it.
Now that the federal government is ready to rededicate itself to its mission - to governing - it should not be discouraged from doing so by discussion of terms.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks may already be shown on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties will meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round on a regular basis in order to defuse conflicts early on; a lesson from all this dispute.
First of all, however, there are conflicting issues on the agenda with the diesel retrofits and the skilled labour immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get away with swapping premiums, while the SPD and CDU see manufacturers as having a duty to retrofit older diesel technology.
While a rapprochement has emerged over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart on the planned skilled labour immigration law.
The SPD is calling for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will again be controversy among the coalition partners - and how else should it be?
Not the same and the same has joined forces with GroKo, but three partners, some with very different social views and priorities.
Controversy is good.
Without controversy, a society characterised by such diverse and sometimes contradictory interests will not make progress.
However, in order to be constructive, the dispute must not be reopened for partisan reasons on the question of being or not being.
This is still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD are supposed to argue - but always look at the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful for many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the lane change issues can be resolved pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, that is what the people's parties must now fight for.
Mushroom checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in her sights
Does the Minister of Labour, of all people, violate the current employment law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" her legions had been working on social security reform, an exuberant social security minister reported at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In the case of list mushroom mandarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is met with astonishment - she is now bringing the matter to parliament via question.
She said she believed that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the use of her team and in no way to proclaim breaches of current service law in front of cameras."
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to be able to "absolve Har ­ tinger of any suspicion."
Police tear up a street in search of woman's body
Marxgrün - The police declined to comment.
Now there is confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, excavations have been taking place on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is still closed until Monday in the Marxgrün area.
It was preceded by the fact that the investigators had previously set up an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to narrow down the relevant area to a few metres along with its guide on several occasions.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said road, in collaboration with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian monument protection authority.
For more than a year, the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Criminal Investigation Service have been handling the missing persons case.
Over and over again, a bike path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because investigators suspect that Heike's body may have been buried here in the course of the construction of the new state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But there have been riots before.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and the police took place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence protesters with paint powder, among other things, as they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to use a rally to honour their colleagues who were deployed to the polling stations last year in what was considered an illegal referendum.
There was also violence at the time in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police have formed a chain to keep the separatist and central security forces' demonstrations separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the 6,000 or so separatists then tried to break through the police chain by force and threw paint bags and eggs at the officers, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, the authorities said.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region from Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in custody.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the coercive administration was brought to an end.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the "right to self-determination" of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westphalia: Rallying perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split scoreless
Red-and-white Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
Even with FC Gütersloh, it was only a 0-0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators at the Heidewaldstadion, they turned out to be a rallying cry.
The first half was badly manageable by the entertainment factor.
If you wanted to get a beer or a sausage, you could do so without worry.
There was no danger of missing a chance to score, because there was virtually no chance.
First shot after half an hour
In the 28th minute, Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal of the entire match.
The Ahleners had the best - and, in principle, the only real - chance when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling into a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area.
The hosts were even more innocuous.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, and Sinan Aygün came in for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel took aim from 18 metres just above the enclosure and after an hour, the Gütersloher also made an offensive appearance for the first time.
After a shooting by Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
Nick Flock (62) "crowned" the fast-paced account of Sinan Aygün with a lazy shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also followed up with a header from Wieckowicz (66) after a corner ball from the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60) and a little later Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70).
It worked - nothing.
The Ahleners did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but neither did it.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive: "I like the fact that we played to zero," but unfortunately the zero was also in front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede and even though our opponent had no desire to play here," said RW Ahlens, interim coach.
Offensively,"it all smacked a bit" against a team that "just wanted to defend."
In any case, I did not feel that we could get an opponent,"Daut said.
To his chagrin, however, the spectator did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
The idea was too meagre for that.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Luckily, there are enough Kreimers.
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table Expenditure Office, for whom these donations are intended, are delighted.
The volunteers assure: "These donations will also remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the place was still a little empty, but that was to change during the day.
Because: "It's so nice to be sociable here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organiser of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent pinch of humour.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed up against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has fallen ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "substitute" did not allow himself to entertain the ever-increasing number of visitors musically in between.
This was so good that a few folk songs were sung at the end of the hour.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to put the opening date in his schedule this time around.
He is pleased with the many active people with their stands, including mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a blackboard," he nevertheless thanked the men's choir for its action.
Andreas Hajek praised the dedication of all those who were in action at the stands and also included the other festivities that took place in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful coat of paint - here's what's going on.
Then the Maikranz was taken down by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarters.
Work has been done on many stalls for the physical good.
From sweet to savoury, everything was to be had.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, got creative with his decorative saw.
He offered veneers, beer lids with Reckenfelder motifs and a lot more.
Three beekeepers from Reckenfelder offered a specialty: "Reckenfelder Honig," brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter still has a specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course, with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to access it again and again, so the cake tasted good.
It is the conviviality that allowed visitors to linger long into the evening hours, even without a stage programme that does not exist at the Autumn Festival.
Smears with local political message: No successful advertisement for skate equipment
In Lengerich, unknown people have advertised the construction of a skate facility in a way that is hardly conducive.
There are corresponding lubricants in several places, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, a criminal complaint has been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" Are emblazoned on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering has already been discovered on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt bistro after the trade fair on 19 September.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an edding at the time, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, however, it was back, this time sprayed on," Rottmann said.
He assumes that the appropriate advertising sign will have to be replaced.
This particular case is particularly noteworthy by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate facility is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the city's school, sport and culture department, without mentioning names.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the issue of skate equipment.
After the old one was dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the majority of the Council voted in favour of the fire service car park.
However, this idea has not been implemented - too many factors seem to be opposed to construction at this point.
A U-turn followed at the end of June.
The members of the main and financial committee have now voted unanimously in favour of the Gutenberg School site.
Jürgen Kohne says on the state of play that the administration is currently in the midst of concrete planning.
The City Council will then have the final say.
He expects a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Air traffic control bottleneck gets worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers do not see any signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we have had wind, in 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm will come," the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-standing staffing shortage in European air traffic control systems, for which there is no quick fix.
"Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots will take four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Across Europe, the market for fully trained pilots is empty.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized the fact that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the federal, state, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work condensation and overtime, it will not be possible without us," said the head of the GdF, which has many members in the German air traffic control system.
Maas again blamed the EU Commission for the pilot malaise.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period, which runs until 2019, were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and staff savings in national air traffic control systems are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut the air even further" for air traffic control.
At the moment, the EU guidelines are being voted on by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is under constant lobbying pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," said Maas.
He said he hoped the high cost of delays for airlines would lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German air traffic control (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," said Maas.
The previously announced admission of 120 pilots per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary staffing structure is not yet connected with this.
ThyssenKrupp Supervisory Board votes to restructure Group
The members of the ThyssenKrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the group.
According to the will of ThyssenKrupp interim chief executive Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed chairman of the board at the meeting on Sunday, the struggling group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are said to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff cuts beyond the already known cuts in administration.
After two resignations, the controlling body has only eight heads on the capital side.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken at a general meeting in 2020.
The new ThyssenKrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company, ThyssenKrupp Industrials AG, the business of elevators and supplies is to be bundled.
Barcelona: Violence at demonstrations by police and Catalan independence supporters.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan pro-independence demonstrators in Barcelona have resulted in violent clashes with scores of people injured.
According to the city council, around 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as around 6,000 pro-independence demonstrators.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a large crowd.
According to the forces, however, pro-independence protesters repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and throwing bullets.
According to the information, there were also rants between the participants of the various protest marches.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
The police said there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who, almost exactly a year ago, took action against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona, of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez told AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drowned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, dismissed the allegation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades, who have only done their duty last year: To defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," assured the policeman.
Breakdown allowed access to personal data of UK ministers
A security flaw in a mobile phone app caused the personal data of ministers and MPs from the Conservative British Tory party to be temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the breakdown was announced a day before the Tory party conference in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning, Hanover police reported a serious traffic accident on the main road 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people have died when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently engulfed in flames.
The forces are on the ground.

Football: Juve coach praises Ronaldo's best game after top scoring
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record-breaking 3-1 (1:1) victory against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the pricey star was the decisive man in the important match against the chaser, even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game around after falling behind early on by Dries Mertens (10th minute) and, for the time being, hanged off the worst chaser.
The goalscorer, brought in by Real Madrid, first set up former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26 / 49).
And Ronaldo, after a corner with a header, also did the groundwork to hit the head of defence Leonardo Bonucci (76), who had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," praised the coach.
But Allegri, of course, also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to be even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
The best Juve goalscorer at the moment is Mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three on his account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' dominance seems to be even more crushing.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champions of the past seven years already have a six-point lead over Naples.
The former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, who trained second in the table, was not without chances against Turin.
But at the latest, after the place of Mario Rui (58), who had already been warned, the lead was decided.
The Portuguese had to leave the pitch with yellow and red after getting too hard against Paulo Dybala.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German national has made his mark at Juve.
The Liverpool striker has played in all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said was "half an hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the Turin side's 2-0 win and is banned for Tuesday's home game against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
Rapper Kanye West has attracted attention with a particularly bizarre appearance on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" over the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused headlines and question marks among viewers.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change just in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, you can only call him "Ye," according to the musician.
"The creature formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince, who took his stage name.
However, the pseudonym is not news.
The tenth album has already been released under this name.
In an interview with radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think" Ye "is the most commonly used word in the Bible and that's where it means" you,"" the rapper said.
Football: Bundesliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar's coach, Averhage, made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was simply more hands-on, we almost never put him in front of any problems."The list of Hoetmar shooting opportunities reads correspondingly thin.
Grade two goals in 90 minutes, so it is rarely possible to make games positive.
Football League A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two opportunities in the first round, but Maik Krause took advantage of the first from a sharp angle to take the early lead (7).
Steffen Uphus could have stepped up in the 43rd minute, but after a great groundwork by Krause, he squandered free standing.
The hosts had only a double chance when Moritz Höne initially failed to score from goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and in the aftermath Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster keeper.
After the break, the visitors became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61) and Heinz Linnemann (69) all gave away.
In addition, Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use a trade metre - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it (75).
It was only when Nils Berheide poked the ball over the line that the match was decided (81).
"We had criticized each other hard before, but it was different today than in the last few weeks," Florian Kraus concluded.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7th), 0:2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75. / Hoetmar).
Football: Bundesliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in albachts: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4.
"I don't even know what to think of it," he said.
"We didn't get access to them at all," he said, presumably referring to the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also to all the other green-whites who stood out with a collective offensive drive.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, smirking cheekily and pulling away from his players, on the other hand, it was a relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair by three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is struggling to maintain the class.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes that were behind him.
"That was by far our best performance of the season," he says.
"The way we come back after the 0-2, the way we play against one of the top teams in the league all the time, it was really phenomenal."
This makes it all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top goalscorer Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for that goal.
He set up the 2-0 over the left for Fabian Fröhning (39).
We knew that, but you can't take a player like that out completely.
"It was madness what he did," Lewandowski said, unencumbered by the quality of his opponent.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own penalty equalised: McGill's free-kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long corner (45).
After the change of sides, it was McGill who scored the equaliser (59).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a cracking, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalised (69).
Despite being overcrowded, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80).
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74. / albachts).
Football: TSV Strasberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the national league duel between TSV Strasberg and FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually come in for three points, but coach Oliver Pfaff's team was very good and in the end the game ended 0-0.
Media: Entire Bureau of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire board of football's second division, Dynamo Dresden, has resigned.
Several media outlets in the evening agreed to a joint letter from the Saxony Board.
At first there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal is supposed to be internal infighting with the former Bundesliga player.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
It's good that he's gone again.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany is as much of a relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish president spent three days in Berlin and Cologne, and many thought he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy of Tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offerings
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing is offering about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he will personally pick up the tolerance prize in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: As Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
This is how academy director Udo Hahn reckoned with him when he proudly said: "All federal presidents and chancellors have been with us." However, the fact that celebrities keep appearing at the academy in Tutzing Castle was also an issue in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective; on 29 September, the writer Frido Mann will attend a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged to personally accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the academy in Tutzing, which is also awarded to television presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
There will be around 80 meetings by mid-2019.
"The pension is not safe!" Is the title of a conference.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - this is how the academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting on Syria:" Barbarism without limit."
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war makes a mockery of any humane idea."
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change in work through digitisation.
Academy director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions, or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting on the 200.
Karl Marx's birthday is about to be celebrated by more visitors to the direction of critique of capitalism, while others are more likely to see a tendency "from the left to the centre."
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel,"so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Church of Christ in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret soloist, Teubner opted for gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man, and what else there might be, but also with music.
She used the mini guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes speaks up to the end of the sentence, and on the other hand, he is a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner is so congenially harmonious that some may have wished for a solo.
This was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, in the same way that it suited the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: The satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, would be of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have come out of Mozart's composition if "the Nannerl" had opened the door unexpectedly?
So Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wounden" to the "Song of Death," and from Mozart's G minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, presented flowers to the chansons.
But the chairman, Heidemarie Markenbeck, could not take any additional thanks.
In addition to appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt, she had the idea of giving the duo a place in Wolbeck.

The background is Musk's surprise announcement in August that he would take Tesla off the stock market.
In its lawsuit, the SEC accused Musk of providing false and misleading information.
Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have slightly revised down the number of victims.
10 passengers were slightly injured instead of 15.
All have since been discharged from hospital.
The French bus driver had remained in hospital for one night for observation.
He will be released later in the day, a spokesman for the police said.
The cause of the accident of the long-distance bus at Bruchsal is still unclear.
The long-distance bus crashed head-on against a guardrail on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women's national league: Ahlener SG narrowly retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlenerinnen had problems especially with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten matches.
"I was really happy with the defence, only one player scored too many goals.
We didn't get to grips with them,"said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many missed opportunities.
This time his team missed the concentration in the final.
As a result, the ASG was almost behind by the end, with 11:12 at the break and 15:18 (45) at the back.
Only towards the end did the wider bench of the hosts make a decisive impact.
Aydogdu also set up left-back Merle Klement, who then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5 / 3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd women's league: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
At the second league runner-up VC Allbau Essen, the blue-whites won by 3:1.
"This was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes it easier for Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked this out,"said coach Dominik Münch after an almost impeccable performance by his team in the toppled leader of the table.
The first round was dominated almost at will by the guests.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12, he went with 25:15 to last year's runner-up.
Essen took over in a two-way tie, but did not come into play.
We kept them busy.
Our opponent has taken a high risk, but has also produced a number of tickets.
In the second set, the BSV led by 12:8."Essen has changed the assumption to three bars.
We couldn't keep up the pressure.
Food has sucked in, and we have let ourselves be lulled in a bit,"Münch continued.
At 18:17, the women volleyball players from the Ruhr region were ahead for the first time.
Although Ostbevern had four more set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its target.
"The game was now a class better," the practice manager said of the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the tide in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly."
Over 7:3 and 15:13, the blue-whites brought four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the large Ditib mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a shambles in German-Turkish relations, which can only be painstakingly reversed," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, to the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of emphasizing the Muslims' affiliation with Germany side by side with German leaders, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "reinforced many reservations."
Hometown club Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break, Folktreff time is finally back.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30pm, the Nottuln hometown club will be hosting its fifth Nottuln Folktreff in the Old Office's fireplace room.
It was almost exactly a year ago that we had a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln,"says Hanns Moormann, chairman of Nottuln's home club.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk meeting would take place so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether it was Storm Friederike in January or the heatwave in July, the fireplace room of the office was always full.
"As always, the programme at the next Folktreff is a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old drummers," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites friendly musicians to Nottuln.
For the first Folktreff- "Birthday," Klaus Spellmeyer pledged with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling," a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with Platinum German lyrics.
Now he's on the road with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff are fond of remembering the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten, with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night," enthused the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many cheerful guests to once again spend a sociable and humorous evening," says the invitation from the home club.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to be actively involved is invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30pm, but the entrance is already at 7pm.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on their way to becoming the world's largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese Competition and Markets Authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
As a result, the multi-billion dollar merger is still subject to approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the US.
Most recently, according to an insider, the chances of an agreement there had improved, because Linde had promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and state care was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On 29 September 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last impulses for the founding of the district association for horticulture and state care Kulmbach were set, and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday evening, he celebrated a big anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
At the time, however, he was still called differently: As a "district sobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land," he was baptized by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - in fact, it was purely about fruit growing, about flowers and horticulture nobody thought about at the time.
"At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained district nurse Günter Dippold in his lecture.
Fruit trees were supposed to line highways, and so-called industrial gardens were set up in schools.
The cultivation of fruit is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7,000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village embellishment and nutrition play an equally important role, as do the imparting of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwerfen" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, while OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
Chestnut collecting was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that smartphone & Co. can be used to collect a similar amount of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Councillor Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"The district association decides where they should stand," added Councillor Söllner, stressing the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, the beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county also left county executive and expert adviser Friedhelm Haun in no doubt.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the county association with a lecture and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, and in the winter it was doused.
At the end of the 50s, however, the garden was transformed into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has endured, it was there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," said the expert in fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added the president of the Bavarian State Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif at the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower glasses of the Thurnau music club.

Priority for Nafta talks: Canada's foreign minister postpones UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: They are giving both trading partners an ultimatum to reach an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister is now giving absolute priority to the trade agreement - and postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the U.N. General Debate in New York due to the pressure of time in the fight for a reshuffle of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will only address the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, it is focusing on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canada and the US negotiators would have 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the US.
The US and Mexico agreed in August to renegotiate the Nafta regional free trade agreement.
Us President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks on a new edition have been going on for over a year.
They are now due to be finalised by Sunday evening (local time), and Trump's administration intends to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.
These are the most dangerous roads in Hanover.
The accident atlas of the Federal Statistical Office shows all the clashes of 2017 with injured and killed people in Hanover.
The most dangerous crossing, therefore, is Königsworther Platz.
The city and ADFC want to use the data to make the roads safer.
Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report in the newspaper O Globo.
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician was attacked on the street in early September during a campaign event in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations, in particular, had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations were mobilizing against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynistic statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He was replaced by former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to stand.
The presidential election in Brazil will take place on 7 October.
As the ex-mayor of the millionaire city of São Paulo, Haddad has been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls so far.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but has recently emerged as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieve an absolute majority in the first round of voting, there will be a run-off on 28 October.
Observers expect that Bolsonaro will not emerge from it successfully - no matter who he is up against.
Bolsonaro is known for hating homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again, he is shocked by verbal derailments.
Another time, he said the supporters of Lula's leftist Workers' Party should be shot.
Europe reclaims Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Only an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairytale at the gates of Paris.
The outsider team of captain Thomas Björn dethroned the favored defending champion USA by a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators on the three days at Le Golf National with great blows and outstanding team spirit.
After a long illness, Danish rock legend has died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
On his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become famous with the band Gasolin, which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 70s.
Their songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
In a statement on Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in all hearts."
The head of the government also recalled that the monarchy's opponent, Larsen, had appeared at the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rock night at the shoe factory: Volume at the level of the compressed air hammer
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a rewriting of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Schuhfabrik civic centre: Pure hard rock by three bands who are friends with each other.
After the sound check and just before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands are clearly enthralling the 120 or so visitors to the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika already knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the forthcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the performance is danced to the harmonious and powerful interplay of the band.
Although "encore" calls cannot be overheard,"Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand."
The fact that hard rock is not the same as hard rock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "high energy rock" of the "Tigers," a synthesizer is also used for "Here We Stand" in addition to guitar rock.
Not only the yearning, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, however, has gained a special reputation since its founding in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its appearances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also sets his own accents for the only covered song of the evening,"Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In the meantime, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a highly acclaimed solo to the sound, which is felt even higher than before, and runs through the audience.
A certain volume is, of course, part of the genre of such a hard rock concert: At the "Mint Mosquito" - Rocknacht, according to information provided by the mixing desk team, the three-part concert of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the press hammer level, but is still significantly below the controls of the "Wacken Festival," which "The Ignition" refers to on its website.
However, the Ahlener audience does not need a deafening 120 decibels in jet engine noise, as is customary for the annual metal pitch in the north of the Republic.
After nearly four hours, the three bands of the harsher, rocking gait have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we are, we have taken the bone saws and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say at the end, albeit in a figurative sense.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in glider accident at Essen / Mülheim airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim / Essen Airport.
A glider crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim / Essen Airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near the Mülheim / Essen airport on Sunday.
As reported by the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung," a glider crashed at the airport's exhibition space.
The pilot died in the crash.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is said to be a one-seater.
The plane was already on the approach at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just a short distance from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
The Mülheim / Essen airport is located on the city limits of the two Ruhr region towns and directly on the driveway to Highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park & Ride offer at major events at the Essen Fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump taunts Kim: 'And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that the US president, North Korea's leader, Kim, is well behaved despite the nuclear crisis.
Now, however, Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has become a new flame.
The tragic thing is that it is a long-distance relationship.
In public on Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half as old sprout of Pyongyang's ruling dynasty, even though it turns out to be a rather tough chunk in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, he was tough, and it went back and forth between us," Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And it is not just the talks with Kim that have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim's announcement of a halt to all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics have so far paid little more than lip service to it.
The US president seemed to be well aware that the affection for the "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - notorious for his martial threats is unlikely to be on everyone's lips.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How horrible, how horrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But he cares very little about it, Trump said, and then pointed his finger at the crowd: "I've always told you it's so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this sprawling arena, we'd only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Bestens visited, atmospheric and, on top of that, pampered by the sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city centre was cleaned out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest did not just take place in the marquee at the fire brigade tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan jail thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to point out their catastrophic conditions in Libya, allowing them to be rescued.
The group shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," one man said in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observer" website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably wouldn't have been able to go back to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
According to his own statement, he put himself in danger of life with the video.
One of his comrades was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the prison conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM is organising the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their homes this year with the help of the programme, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians who have now been rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions in Libya.
However, he has not heard of a call for help via mobile phone video.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the local elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her classes for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At about 16:50, the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the front door of the 1st floor, she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police, who started the investigation.
It is not yet possible to say whether things or money were stolen.
Description of the perpetrator: About 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark trousers, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the Obernberg am Inn Police Inspectorate on 059 133 4244.
German man was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old man has had to endure several days and nights in his car in a wooded area in central France after he stalled the car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue workers discovered the car by accident near a pasture on Saturday afternoon and freed the missing person since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
According to the data, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner was reported missing by his family after he failed to return from a ride in his off-road car across the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive searches, the man's whereabouts remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU), speaking to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he had urged the rule of law in Turkey.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This mainly affects waves of arrests, press freedom and religious freedom.
He has therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this."
According to Laschet, he also referred to the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan was briefly moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's readiness to fly at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected it for political reasons against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their point of contact - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of emphasizing the success of the negotiations on North Korea's denuclearization, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Secretary of State Ri is calling for Washington to be accommodated.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has accused the US government at the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The latest stalemate comes as the US is building on coercive measures that are lethal to building confidence," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
The fact that punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" is "a dream of people who don't know us."
However, in order to build confidence, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri pointed out.
However, there was no "corresponding reaction" from the US side, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, the UN Security Council decided to impose sanctions on the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
Us President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing for strict compliance with the punitive measures at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting did not help the many visitors to the HoT open door house: White blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the harvest tank service.
The youngsters of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the community, which the young people wanted to thank for with the food.
The start of the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then, on the first day after the summer break, the bad surprise came: A power outage had put the huge two-piece refrigerator out of service, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start from scratch again: We got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it on their own," says Westbuer.
And so everyone packed in.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"Chefs can't do better either," praised one visitor impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," said parish priest Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen was amazed with cartoon tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW board of directors
Out of frustration at criticism from within his own ranks, the head of the Essen board, Jörg Sartor, has left his post in the national association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen board had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He resigned as vice-chairman of the NRW boards back in July, Sartor told the "Welt am Sonntag."
There were too many people in my back.
The head of the NRW Table Association, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his sympathy to the DPA for the decision of his longtime deputy.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his move - there were people who didn't know exactly why the Essen board was doing it."
However, Sartor is still active for the Essen board - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
In the "Welt am Sonntag," Sartor again criticized colleagues from other panels.
The approach should not be taken "without us, people in the city are starving to death."
It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people do not starve to death.
The Essen mayor did not attend a conference of the panels in Berlin on Friday.
"I'm told too much sweetness," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis that criticised me at the time.
SF Lorch squander 2-0 lead - Gmünder Daily Mail
Football, regional league Lorch loses to newcomers 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after falling behind - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clear.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV newcomer - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment among the sports fans was great.
Very different from the TV Heuchlingen: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1, but after 90 minutes it won with 2:1. At the top of the table, meanwhile, the SGB was able to win with a 3:0.
Gladbach squander two-time lead - Schalke without Embolo with first win
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals take the lead twice.
Schalke get their first win of the season against Mainz (1-0).
(SDA) Schalke have been sidelined four times in their first five league games with early opponents.
Now Domenico Tedesco's team once again showed the strength with which they finished first behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home side with a header in the eleventh minute after a strong effort from Evgeni Konopljanka, and the hosts subsequently preserved the mini-cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund are now at the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team were 0-2 behind Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but they still managed to win 4-2 in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65) and Marco Reus (69) equalised with a doublette in the space of four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, added another doublette in the closing stages (86 / 94) to the crowning achievement after the break.
The first victory was also won by VfB Stuttgart.
Against Werder Bremen, who had already been decimated by a yellow and red card against Milos Veljkovic before the break, the Stuttgart players had to worry in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler produced a curious throw-in own goal that helped the guests to equalise in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to its first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not make a fully successful debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbach players, joined by Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, took the lead twice, ultimately playing 2-2 and are still waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen, with his second Bundesligator, was responsible for Wolfsburg's 1-1 equaliser.
Yann Sommer was powerless on a flat shot from 20 metres from the Aargau, as was his second goal after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are promising.
Alassane Pléa is proving to be a goalgetter in the storm of foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase, which came from OGC Nice, came for the third time in a row and the seventh time in the seventh game in charge.
After seven laps, Gladbach finished 4th.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen maneuvered into an uncomfortable position against VfB Stuttgart.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt's team were surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which was completed by the former Luganesi Anastasios Donis with his first goal of the season, and after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to lead his team: The 23-year-old Serb won yellow and red after a jersey knock against Daniel Didavi.
Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Brewers back into the game with a curious throw-in own goal (68), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgart players back on the road to victory.
Nuremberg won the duel against Duesseldorf 3-0.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens put the home team on track with a foul penalty.
Macedonians vote on new state name
In Macedonia today, around 1.8 million citizens are voting on whether to change their country's name to Northern Macedonia.
In the event of a yes vote, the nearly three-decade-long conflict with neighbouring Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on changing its name because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any approach by Macedonia to the West.
Voters will therefore also decide on the future integration of the West.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a member of NATO in the event of a positive outcome to the referendum.
Syrians in underground detention.
The refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat up three pensioners and injured them, some of them seriously.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker ran riot on Friday at around 10pm in the escape alley in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they approached the accused, who fired his fists at passers-by and tried to attack them, about his behaviour.
The Syrian then tried to beat and kick the officers.
A short time later, it emerged that the suspect had stabbed three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists at a tram stop in Währinger Straße a short time earlier.
He had also trampled on the trio.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered haematomas, bruises and concussion.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for unknown reasons," as the police said.
He was taken to hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave each other their say on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered civil partnership was not in question for them, Kahrs had previously told the Bild newspaper.
"If we get married, it's right." He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir with a speech of anger on 30 June 2017.
For example, he accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry in the same way as heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the right to adopt.
Garden day: 400 metres of hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Citizens' Association Kinderhaus and the Society for leprosy.
After all, around 400 metres of hedge around the gardens of the residents of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for around 12 supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said the chairman of the citizens' association, Walter Schröer.
And so much has accumulated.
Due to the hot summer, we are late this time, but luckily it is now just a cut of form.
The hedge has already been sheared in the spring.
The breakfast, which always follows the work, also has a long tradition.
"Everyone should stay with us," said Walter Schröer.
World Championships in Rio: Hannes Aigner takes gold at the Canoe Slalom World Championships
Augsburg's Hannes Aigner has won the gold medal at the end of the Canoe Slalom World Championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he missed out on Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, I had enough rides here at the facility and it was all right today,"said the third Olympic gold medallist from London 2012.
In the finish, he threw his paddle away with joy and raised both arms with confidence - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had runner-up number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech Jiri Prskavec was second ahead of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempted burglary this autumn in a detached house.
Luckily, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to take advantage of this again.
Yesterday, the Gauting Police Inspectorate reported the first attempted burglary this autumn.
The alarm system is due to the fact that it remained in the attempt at the detached house on Königswieser Straße.
It started when the perpetrators put their hands on it just before 8pm on Friday.
The burglars did suspect that the residents were not at home.
However, the alarm system apparently surprised them to such an extent that they managed to escape without prey.
Notes to the PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Hertha bust: Caught up in reality: Bayern demanded against Ajax
The prediction is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin will "not please" FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim result for the tenure of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance models under the new coach, Niko Kovac, are not expected to increase to a larger autumn low for the Munich team.
"A week ago, we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now the reality has caught up with us a bit,"said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are giving gas to Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, they have not scored a goal of their own, as at the same time of the pre-season, they have lost two matches in Serie A without a win, and the Bundesliga leaders have lost to Borussia Dortmund for the time being.
The overall situation is far from as dramatic as it was at the end of September 2017, when Carlo Ancelotti failed, but the record holder must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1-1 with its lurid man-versus-man tactics and the Berliners with their playful needles over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, just as the recently overpowering Bayern are yet to be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again," Kovac said.
Apart from that, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his native city and only pushed his first defeat as Munich coach to the again poor handling of chances.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim result of his tenure a positive one before the international break - otherwise the tone is likely to tighten.
For example, Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before this season's second premiership appearance after the 2-0 defeat at Benfica in Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second preliminary match against Ajax, which had also defeated aek Athens with a 3-0 lead at the start, will begin.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also score again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As was the case after the losing cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua kimmich in particular spoke plainly.
The lawyer appeared in the role of Mahner.
"I don't think it's all bad luck, we've got to work it out again, because we don't take a lot of chances and make mistakes at the back," the 23-year-old said shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bayern were already five points behind Dortmund, who have now taken the lead with a point.
And so, with a twinkle in the eye, kimmich was at least positive that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's a good thing," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in the firing line: Özil Causa: Erdogan's sharp attack on Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany with serious accusations.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for the authority of interpretation in the long-running dispute over Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticised the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the head of the DFB defended the association line.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally harshly attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the caucus at the ZDF "sports studio" in Mainz.
"In the future - because we also have a lot of migrant players in the submarines - we have to draw very precise conclusions that this kind of thing does not happen again," said the 57-year-old, who wants to win a national player without a migrant background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had strongly denounced racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Mesut Özil, who was born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England,"Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
Honestly, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen up to the German national team, have been excluded.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt he had been "treated sensibly by the DFB."
At the same time, he announced that he would introduce himself to players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - it's not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I have always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a result, an additional integration officer will now be appointed alongside the Brazilian native Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says:" The issue is important, we have to take care of it,"it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person following the World Cup exit and the Özil affair, he intends to run for the post of DFB president again next year.
"I'm doing my job and I'm trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
10-year-old builds three accidents in three hours
Coburg / Rödental - Police say the 75-year-old caused the accidents between 10am and 1pm on Friday.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no exchange of people, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had got off the road and drove against a control post.
When approached, the man did not want police on the scene and then drove off.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner, who has lived in his place of residence for decades, proceeded and rammed a construction vehicle as he turned around.
Finally, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car suffered significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember much more.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moor fire in Meppen: Almost 1000 troops are still in operation.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire at a German army base in Emsland, 980 troops are still working on the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
According to a spokesman, as the situation continues to develop steadily, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of troops is planned, it says.
On Sunday night, an above-ground fire was discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster, which was declared just over a week earlier on 21 September, was lifted because of fears that the flames could put adjacent forests and settlements at risk due to wind and sparks.
On Thursday, it was reported that the fire was no longer threatening to spread to neighbouring communities.
At times, more than 1500 troops tried to control the large fire on the ground.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "tornadoes" are also planned for 2 and 5 October.
The fire was triggered by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the moor fire had at times moved up to a hundred kilometres across the north-west of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point to receive claims.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into force, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave each other their say on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered civil partnership was not in question for them, Kahrs had previously told the Bild newspaper.
If we get married, that's right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir with a speech of anger on 30 June 2017.
For example, he accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry in the same way as heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the right to adopt.
Macedonia referendum on new state name started
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is what the neighbour Greece insists on because of its northern province of the same name.
As a means of exerting pressure, Athens has blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also kick off the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from oblivion
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on 30 September.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the US in 2016, leaving behind a work that preserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is designed to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can still only be taken with explicit consent, emphasizes SwissTransplant.
(DPA) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be accessed by SwissTransplant if required.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be taken - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, emphasizes SwissTransplant.
It is estimated that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the SwissTransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases will a card be found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the deceased's wish.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Immer.
A similar registration system is already in place in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman for the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker Albert, says.
"There is no register in which people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation on organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless they or relatives disagree.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old pupil is world champion in head racing
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda, from Japan, is a world champion in head racing.
He competed in Wolfsburg at the weekend against 39 competitors.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue for the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany finished third.
The youngest World Cup participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old retiree from France, as chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organises the competition every two years.
Previous tasks included, for example, 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, in which participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while computing.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was in Bielefeld two years ago when he was 14 years old at the time.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or prodigy, organiser Laue can do little.
"Head-scratching can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-oriented computing competitions.
One of the disciplines, for example, is the square root-pulling of six-digit numbers.
When calculating diversity, candidates are given surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans have a good chance, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often advantageous, because head-scratching is learned more intensively and with other effective methods, even in early childhood.
Haunting appeal: Video featuring naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer screening
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows off her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to point out breast cancer and make her case for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands conceal her most intimate parts.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died from it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about early breast cancer detection, which can save lives.
Serena Williams herself would have died almost a year ago.
There were complications in the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
Emergency surgery has been launched to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a significant expansion of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will examine a draft law on the so-called "Symbols Act."
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle will shake up her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polar cold air will reach Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists at the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to between 1,500 and 1,200 metres at the start of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 metres at high intensity, they said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher-lying pass roads (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstrasse), the road conditions are therefore wintry.
Farmers will be allowed to start annual knick-grooming on Monday.
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers will be allowed to start annual knick-grooming on Monday.
The "green groves," unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor state for around 200 years.
The hedges of trees and shrubs, which are up to five metres wide, are a "forest substitute" and are the last refuge for many animals and plants.
Knicks connect scattered habitats as corridors, through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the managing director of the Nature Conservation Association of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
The Knicks are living fences.
The Knicks were created on the basis of an order by the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only a field boundary and a cattle fence, they also supplied firewood and beams to the farmers for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also dates back to that time: The dense, intertwined demarcations were able to develop by "twisting" the branches.
Today, around 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a wooded, diverse landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a substitute habitat for around 7,000 species of animals.
Up to 1,800 different species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds in one kilometre.
However, the Knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, it will wither into a light line of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, will also lose the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, knick-grooming can only be carried out outside the incubation period from October to March.
After Sulawesi tsunami, Indonesians talk about the situation on the ground
In an interview with the editorial network Deutschland (RND), local resident Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:
Were you there yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes happened, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive for more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport in Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills, where they still persist for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are staying in front of their homes, and there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The civil service has been completely shut down and the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the inmates are walking around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does the communication and information supply on the island work?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but it didn't work before and we only got information over the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people they don't know if they live and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many people thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then it came.
In other regions that have not been hit by the tsunami, there has been misinformation that a tsunami is hitting the region and they have run into the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
However, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, and the earthquake has affected a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must give up Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss the VfB Stuttgart with serious muscle injuries for a longer period of time.
Aogo suffered a muscle fracture in the back of his left thigh in the 2-1 win against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the German Football League announced on Sunday.
In Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle fracture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss matches after the following break.
VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast for the downtime.
A muscle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, and a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival closes the annual series of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the chants on the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar nominees from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best contests in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching Fire Department tried to catch an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - On Sunday morning, a white, injured duck fell on walkers on Lake Olchinger.
She was staying at the water station.
In order to help the animal, passers-by called the police and the fire brigade.
However, the first attempts to catch the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the forces again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and push it back to shore, where it was then put in a transport box by a firefighter with a brave grip after almost an hour.
The duck, which was injured on the chest, was then taken to the LMU animal clinic in Oberschleissheim.
But according to the initial assessments, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard aiming for World Cup medal
In fourth place at the Olympics, biathlete Julian Eberhard was in the stomach for a long time.
Next winter, the Saalfeldener wants to make up for the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old the medal up for grabs in the Pyeongchang Olympics sprint.
Seven tenths of a second ended up missing out on bronze.
"I consciously gave myself time to process it," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but I just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to make up for the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point you have to strike.
Eberhard is on the World Cup track in Östersund (SWE): "I have already closed the track to my heart," he remembers with joy his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in last winter's World Cup in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the relay, he finished second in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbocharged pace
The time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at a turbocharged pace, Republicans in the US Senate want to secure a slim majority for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial on coercion charges.
President Donald Trump has given investigators a deadline of Friday to investigate the alleged incidents, which have lasted more than 30 years.
The latest twist in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's appeal, which was accompanied by a culture fight, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and the first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer launched angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge on the US Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but called for an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who on Thursday referred to the serious allegations as "shelling," initially refrained from further attacks against women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune."
In this way, final doubts could be resolved, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump lashed out at Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They're trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
A government official told the Wall Street Journal that "they are not going on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar device installed in a "civilian vehicle" in the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit will be stationed on Gartenstrasse from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief for Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
However, against Mainz, the factor of time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime, it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area,"said the head of Schalke 04 - and breathed a sigh of relief.
After all, the Königsblau still managed to finish the close 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first win of the season.
In fact, things could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf had given the 11th team of head coach Domenico Tedesco certainty, Tedesco said: "Overall, the first half was good, both in terms of play and in terms of pressing," the head obviously played more and more of a role as the game went on.
Schöpf is not really a headball monster.
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and so they kept pulling back.
And defended against Mainz with man and mouse.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his head ball hit: "I'm actually the worst head ball player in the team."
But in the end, the only thing that counts is victory.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including, of course, at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the early stages and make a firework of it," said Schalke's head coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle matches over 90 minutes.
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry about.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the bar 59th / 72nd or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a treble," said Tedesco: "You've already felt the fear a little bit."
So I'm glad we won.
He was not the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Column of smoke visible in Leitzachtal 2 km away
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From around two kilometres away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire at around 1.30pm on Sunday.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - Police and fire brigade soon found out the cause: An unknown person had set off rubbish on a two-square-metre area on Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it appeared that he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the embers unattended.
And this is close to the forest.
30 Fischbach firefighters were involved in pulling up and extinguishing the fire.
The police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on an equal footing
In front of them is the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my mission to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance in organising the evening.
El-Mafaalani gets into the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and one or two jokes, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflicting topics: Migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, are conflicts increasingly arising?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at a table, and the first generation of migrants sit at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to come to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to play their part.
This leads to conflict.
The decisive factor, therefore, is not whether one classifies oneself politically on the right or on the left, but rather: "Am I for or against an open society?" He stresses.
In the beginning, the discussion is more and more lively.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani is standing in front, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: She is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "it is only when we understand what the problem is that we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the ensuing signing session, he still has an open ear for the questions of the guests, and in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, there was intensive discussion.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win opening games
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and away win.
In a hard-fought match in his own hall, Gießen won 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonner won at BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
Alba Berlin is the first league leader of the season after Saturday's 112:55 gala against Science City Jena.
At the start of the new season, the German champions Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich already struggled on Friday to win an 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby on Saturday at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is obviously huge: More than 100 interested parties have applied to buy one of the properties in Landsham South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new Landsham South development area on the open market.
This is what Mayor Roland Frick says.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 properties offered by the municipality at more favourable conditions or prices has been completed - similar to the previous local model.
More than 100 applications have been received, according to Frick.
"The documents are currently being examined," in terms of application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Plieningen, the aim is to have drawn up the list of candidates for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the local council.
After that, the award could take place.
In total, 50 plots of land for single and double houses will be created on the area in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-family houses, each of which is expected to have eight units.
The development is now almost complete, with roads and roads to be paved in the near future.
A single plot of land and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells most of the land on the open market, 20 plots in a socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two apartment buildings in the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments funded by the state.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated, housing for about 200 people is being created on the surface of the new Landsham South development area.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start of a new nursery is taking place there.
It will house three kindergarten and three crib groups, as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalke's Naldo "great sport" also succeeds on the bench.
Not in the starting line-up for the third time in a row: Nevertheless, Naldo would like to thank Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo aparecido Rodrigues sat on the bench for the third time in a row, not in the Schalker starting line-up, the understanding among many people would have been great if the Brazilian, who is almost two metres tall, had really spoken of the frustration of his soul.
But when the Schalke players gathered in the centre circle as usual after the 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05, and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo for the sake of simplicity, turned on and said: "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite being a reservist again, had no resentment.
Problích Naldo, who was hailed as the best scarlets player last season, knows that he has not really got on the pitch with his coach - but is given a break for good reasons.
One reason is called "load control."
It was not easy to tell him that.
"It was not easy to tell him that, I'll tell you quite honestly," Tedesco said of the moment he told Naldo that he was not in the starting lineup.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the club,"Tedesco explained.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone is able to go through it at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat,"Tedesco said of the rotation, which recently caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: By also proving himself to be an exemplary team player on the bench.
The mood in Austria's industry continued to accelerate in August, when compared to the eurozone.
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low of 46.7 points.
However, Austria has the third best mood in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone's PMI rose 1.1 points to 45.1, but the index is still below the 50 mark for the 13th consecutive month, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry hit that threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The bottom line was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but at a slower pace than in previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March, at 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened downturn could mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But the industry - in the third quarter at least - remains the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: Export orders in the eurozone have not fallen as much as they have since November 2011.
The companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also fell more than initially thought in August.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers' Index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are being investigated.
Tuchel's PSG team manage eighth win in eighth league game

Nice coach Thomas Tuchel continues to rush from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won 3-0 (1-0) thanks to two hits from superstar Neymar and was thus successful in the eighth league game.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and produced the final score in the aftermath.
Christopher Nkunku (46) provided the interim 2-0.
As a result, Paris also managed the rehearsal for the landmark second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the premiership, Tuchel's team suffered the only defeat of the season so far in the 2-3 draw at Liverpool.
