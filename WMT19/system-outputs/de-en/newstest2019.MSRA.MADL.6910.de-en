Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Schöne Münchnerin" candidates deliver at the shooting with people photographer Tuan and defy wind, spray and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shooting can be found in the video:
DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"This is a question that naturally depends on getting into conversation, on talking to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung."
Despite the months-long debate about Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed up to a certain point that this would be the case, "said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it on the grounds that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build up any pressure, but he knows it from football that "when you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it is a pity that this conversation has not come about so far."
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 2.13 p.m., the Linz professional fire brigade was alerted to a fire in Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the allotment garden settlement, danger was in delay.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and fire debris had to be removed to the extent absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had infected a battery for charging at noon.
That could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as has the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") herself streamed live how she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see "Luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family, which she claims to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family almost flees from the actress, Lohan persecutes the parents and their children.
It accuses the adults of trafficking children.
She does not provide any evidence for all this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this," Lohan can be heard in the video as she continues to follow the family along the street.
Apparently she tries to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and giving Lohan a slap in the face.
In tears, the actress then affirms how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to take this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of deaths on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
Following the severe 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there is talk of at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could increase even further.
Rescue crews have not yet entered the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Chairman of the Tesla Supervisory Board
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused a stir in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car manufacturer.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now both have reached an agreement.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain CEO.
British Conservative Party Congress
Sharply guarded - the Tory Party Congress
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the hardline Brexiteers, led by former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already reached an agreement
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name doubles for years.
Now they have reached an agreement.
The state of Macedonia is to be called Northern Macedonia in future and the population will vote on this Sunday - whether things are going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("Der nicht") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before Brazil's presidential election, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" presents himself as an anti-system candidate, leading the polls.
His fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers "Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" refurbishment takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer, to the industry magazine "Automobilwoche."
Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who was imprisoned and on leave, announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / transmission combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in dealing with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was set up in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer had made "serious organisational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and intends to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the exhaust gas fraud became known.
In doing so, he knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Bram Schot, Chief Sales Officer, currently heads the company as acting CEO.
Due to the changeover to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there were production losses at Audi, said Schot to the "Heilbronner Stimme."
Basically, he sees a decline in demand for limousines such as the A6, A7 and A8 audio models produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
15,000 reservations have already been made for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to join the DFB Executive Committee
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism of his person after the end of the World Cup and the Özil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for the office of DFB President next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as possible," said Grindel as a guest early on Sunday morning in ZDF's "Current Sports Studio."
You have to keep trying to get re-elected, I will do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "feel like working on the future project" after winning the European Football Championship 2024.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first complete three-year term.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future European Championship chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB Executive Committee.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau would agree that he will continue to advise in this role in the Bureau in the future and then, of course, be cordially invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future an international player without a migrant background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
The Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic currently hold this office, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background clearly influences society and football and says," the topic is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Really lose weight with half-wise scales
I've owned a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat percentage.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The thing also calculates the body mass index, but it is rather for the sausages.
Does he not say anything about whether I have replaced fat with muscle?
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up won without any problems with 112: 55 (52: 31) and offered a convincing match for more than 40 minutes.
Newcomer Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 points), who was hired from Ludwigsburg, also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators at his compulsory game debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the compulsory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84: 80 (39: 37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg pro Gabriel Olaseni came to 14 points.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP giant Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83: 76 (41: 34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter in the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the Basketball Lions Braunschweig there was a clear 100: 64 (48: 30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings outperformed the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweiger, with which NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26: 1 run of the Baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, among others, during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city centre of Cologne had been partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were deployed - including snipers.
The Islamic Association of Ditib is criticized because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: stars, boos and seconds of horror
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have called for more commitment to the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Engage wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of around 60,0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and a golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations, also appeared on stage at the spectacle, which lasted several hours.
In between, however, there was a moment of horror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was shots, got scared and tried to escape.
Shortly panic arose, people ran in confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin then reassured people from the stage.
"Nobody is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You are all safe.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet.
If you wanted to get one, you had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors there was cheering and applause from the audience - boos for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Together with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, he spoke out on stage in favour of greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke out in the US Senate Judiciary Committee in favour of the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge, alienating many women.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse, including attempted rape, against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who say they have experienced sexual assault themselves, confronted him in an elevator on their way to the committee meeting.
"You can also meet me in an elevator at any time," Flake now said to the crowd at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends expulsion of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the ejection of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had covered a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the front row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert told Bild am Sonntag.
It was about a disturbance of the course of the press conference.
The journalist's action had caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had therefore arranged for personal protectors to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
Turkey's leaders blame the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: it was not until the beginning of September that the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but the two are still being tried in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht," produced by the NDR, is known for humid conversations at the counter of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten."
Moderator Ina Müller and her guests come across some beer, some wine or even higher-percentage drinks in order to loosen the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory singing interludes.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "Männerherzen," "Terror - Ihr Urteil" or "Der geilste Tag."
But the trip to the far north did not go well for the Munich resident.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumpled on it, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not ill, he has only one powerful hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER goes to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And the round of egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half past three, also leaves out.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips for fighting the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most effective - headache pills.
Others were simply amused by the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
How Ina Müller survived the nocturnal drinking is not yet known.
Since she has been moderating the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and rubbish
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and garbage.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and meanwhile dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating group to the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the showpiece Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland a more than inglorious sight.
The topic has occupied members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for some time, so the cycling commissioner of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Board.
There has been no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from moving the seating group to regularly emptying the waste containers and cleaning the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the topic to the local advisory board.
It is not only the garbage that drives cyclists and local residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate at weekends.
Not only is it often loud, but the railings are also destroyed: posts torn out of the ground, rubbish bins demolished, signs bent over, seating furniture smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting place for drinking.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycle path in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it becomes really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "This may set the threshold much higher for grabbing common property.
However, this would require a police patrol to pass by in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen would like to see the Haaße hill develop.
It must be made more attractive.
One could be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our cycle path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany, "said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa to be an extremely critical danger zone.
There is no turning lane on the Haaße hill.
In case of heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between the flow of traffic on both sides, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family togetherness over coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took part, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-time resident of Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colors," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, explained District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not yet experienced this in other parts of the city.
What did the copywriters see themselves connected to?
The Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned in the villages.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit-like song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Again and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
So one learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
Franke was able to report from sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the programme.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed all kinds of things on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favourites of the jury, however, there was something special - so that others can also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Him with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with its musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again for the final - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She regarded the event as a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full Kulturbahnhof.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which - the old trick with the red foil - can only be deciphered once you have inserted them.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Windows.
3. Dice.
4. Feast. "
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on.
Because it is not the terms that are to be guessed here, but codes.
Alternately one player per team is the encryption.
He gets a code card that perhaps says "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto," it is not the terms behind the secret foil that are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "cube," "feast" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible does not; because that wins the game if he succeeds twice in cracking the code.
So the encryptor notes down and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "lots" as a contrast to party; here, of course, something like "party" would also be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention at school and knows the window collapse there.
So it goes on round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but you can rhyme them better with every hint the encryption gives there.
So the paraphrases should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The other players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanatory video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre primus "Codenames," which also imposes an agent theme on a game with fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you are only interested in guessing and not in winning points, you can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspectorate twice during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler salute to a passing police patrol in the Upper City, later he also noticed in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholic and did not comply with the police 's expulsion, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach police inspection in the detention cell.
In a sober state, he then also has to answer for the use of license plates of unconstitutional organizations under criminal law.
Works Pressig was home to the thrust locomotives
The railway depot in Pressig was the hub in the Franconian Forest for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers hit buffers, you could hear it all over Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes squeaked and the wagons rattled.
That was pure railway.
Statements that symbolize Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Franconian Forest was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which has its apex in Steinbach am Wald after an ascent of about 220 metres in altitude.
In order to cope with this, train and thrust locomotives were needed in the past, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprenticeship workshop, overhead line and railway maintenance.
"The centrepiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional railway worker for 47 years.
The railway depot (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam locomotives and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and thrust locomotives.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10.000 wagons were still ranked per month.
Parts of the plant were demolished in 1982 and the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that better use of the site has not been envisaged, including in terms of freight transport."
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated the anniversary of "50 Years of Electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" with a pompous station festival in Pressig.
"There were 10.000 enthusiastic spectators here," Georg Dinkel remembers.
A little later the end.
On 1 June 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn, the marshalling yard Pressig was history.
"The marshals and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any misstep would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing like Julia Görges before.
Kerber won the China Open 6: 2, 6: 2 against the Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent in the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6: 3, 4: 2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian number 13 gave up.
The sister-in-law now has to deal with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Enjoyment," a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach at the weekend.
With great relief, organizers and visitors registered the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open-air area of the estate Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Kunst und Genuss."
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be seen in Mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been with us since the very beginning.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have helped to design flyers.
Once again this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there will be a 70-cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen," designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased about the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was won over for the musical accompaniment.
Walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau, awaits the visitor on the right.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully provided with 20 wind turbines, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushes in the background, the object looks like a fairy tale and invites you to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental, who prefers to dedicate herself to the event 15 years K & G in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child."
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colourful fantasy structure of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate their 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albachtener also gave vent to their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They absolutely did not want to resign themselves to the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has become a legend in the meantime: they launched the MGV 68 Albachten on a bench in the Tinnenbusch.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter."
"It will be full today," suspected Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachtener singers.
Especially for the anniversary they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
It became an elegant ball, festive clothes had been asked for before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Encounter," but comfortably at tables.
In between, movement was the order of the day: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten themselves let the voice resound.
Cheerful songs were announced to match the occasion.
Almost set: "Such a day, as beautiful as today."
In keeping with the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheim wine."
In allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hops."
The choral direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at that time, was again sovereign.
"It is simply fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege: "He has such an easy way, it is a masterpiece that he performs." Incidentally, this time not only men presented themselves as singers.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at his desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented fine-sounding poetry.
There was also a big raffle.
The proceeds will be used to finance a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring finds its way really well in league three.
No trace of shyness or fracking, the independents do their thing.
And that at the 3: 0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"That was not crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied. "On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer the atmosphere was good, the game ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third movement, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring it to the finish, such a game can tip over," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its experienced forces and brought the full yield to the finish.
"We're all aware of who's on the other side in such a derby.
This does not break our neck.
I saw really good volleyball in phases, "Annacker did not quarrel with the 0: 3 - and immediately went over to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independents does not seem to be foreseeable after just three match days.
"It is simply too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only one thing he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable to regional league volleyball. "In any case, they no longer want to look down on the fourth league.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they will have to look up.
However, a first assessment can only be made after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we will go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will start on 14 October in Essen.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the "Dream Ship."
Now she talks openly about the fact that the series could have been partly to blame for her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she disembarked forever.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That might have been a reason, too.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world alone with a suitcase and many colleagues I admired perceived me on an equal footing, "says Keller in an interview with" Bild am Sonntag. "
At first she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "dream ship."
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked that so much, I don't know."
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time might have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans shied away from talking about problems and feelings."
Keller had always tried to be "the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
In good German, this means: I have disguised myself, "she continues.
She always had the feeling that "she was not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who, in truth, I never was, even if I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever. "
After an already failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I sat howling in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why did it never work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love back then "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I approached love far too naively. "
The night butterfly, who regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has this time ventured into the ZFF opening party.
Our butterfly is not a moth, but a little shy of light.
And the glaring glow into which a green carpet on Sechseläutenplatz has dipped blinds him unduly.
But it's just a film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So he staggers over the place on this late Thursday evening, in order to ease himself briefly in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis."
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitation company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: the needy institution on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks to the sky in the men's oasis for some reason.
So out here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who have just entertained the opening film "Green Book" at the best level in the cinema next door, celebrate the start of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store, as they do every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as is well known, the works shown come from all over the world.
What do you not have to come up with in an article about this festival in order not to fall into surreptitious advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The butterfly ties a ribbon around the feelers, which a good fairy has put on him, and two bullish bouncers actually wave him generously in.
Inside, the invited crowd, they dance to live music well after midnight or let DJ dictate rhythms to which they shout at each other, and rinse down exquisite appetizers with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters wait for sipping mouths, next door, the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly sliced, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared out for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without much loss.
You have to love this country for that!
The butterfly studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator."
If these are two separate instructions, he has squandered himself in the dress code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly already saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry tilts a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye," matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting the brand for years, is not here that evening either.
But there, between local celebrities, cash desk and kitchen articles, a face passes by that seems familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His leading actor should not be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, almost looking like a choir boy at the age of sixty, immediately walks through the crowd.
He is not chatted about, not grabbed, one only looks stealthily.
It is precisely for this restraint, often misunderstood as inhibition, that international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is happy about the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled in well in his new home, Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia-Rythmen, as can be seen in a video already published on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second league had defeated the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona shouted into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Senden after last-minute bankruptcy "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat." His protégés were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29: 30 (12: 14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, the Sendener.
Only the initial phase "we totally slept through," the ASV coach was annoyed.
The landlords quickly led with 8: 1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken did not bear fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a jolt went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the gap was only two goals.
Especially Senden's best, Marius Hintze, met again and again in the phase.
After the change, things got even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst equalized to 15: 15, then the relay changer led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three goals (29: 26).
And then?
Involve the impartial in the action.
Bieletzki is usually wary of blaming others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff received "was a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, also stood well against seven men in the back and threw again and again on the empty goal.
But they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come," said Bieletzki, who was completely served.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Hof district), the police are looking for the woman's remains.
Emergency forces dug up a street near Marxgrün on Saturday.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers underneath were removed, as the police and public prosecutor's office jointly reported.
According to new findings, the missing person may have been buried not far from where she lived at the time.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
Investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Investigation Court, together with the Public Prosecutor's Office, has once again been working intensively on the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Office for the Protection of Monuments, the investigators came across a conspicuous feature under the street near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced in the course of the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking on the net.
However, users can also provide additional security themselves.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should rather use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, and there is no harm in equipping computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his impending dismissal as head of the multi-billion dollar company.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission settled out of court a legal dispute over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla each pay $20 million, and Musk relinquishes the position of chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
On the other hand, he is allowed to remain CEO.
In the settlement, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager in the US Federal Court in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk declared that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the lawsuit.
He had always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange and pay $420 per share, with funding secured.
This would have valued Tesla at a total of $72 billion.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla remained on the stock exchange.
Following the agreement, Tesla must now find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members and also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team 1: 1 at Chelsea FC
Liverpool FC scored 1-1 at Chelsea FC.
In the top match at Chelsea FC, the attacker, who had just been replaced by coach Jürgen Klopp, scored 1: 1 (0: 1) in the 89th minute.
After six victories at the start, Liverpool dropped back to second place.
Chelsea remains third, with Manchester City the new leader.
Eden Hazard provided the Chelsea lead in the 25th minute with his sixth goal of the season.
After that, the Klopp team missed the equalization several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger clarified after a solo of Liverpool's goalkeeper Mohamed Salah on the line (31.).
Shortly before the end Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a Schlenzer into the angle.
Record champion Manchester United is slipping deeper and deeper into crisis after the worst start to the season since 1989.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United with 1: 3 (0: 2) and remains with ten points after seven match days only in the table midfield.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow before Tuesday's Champions League match against Valencia FC.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno came to his first Premier League appearance after an injury to Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League match at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won 2-0 against Brighton & Hove Albion through goals from Raheem Sterling (29.) and Sergio Agüero (65.).
Leroy Sané prepared the 1-0, Ilkay Gündogan was not used in the new leader.
"Let's Dance" juror Joachim Llambi and wife Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi has probably separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known through the RTL show "Let's Dance."
After 13 years of marriage Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhalinhalt) reports on the separation of the well-known moderator and dance expert, citing Llambi's lawyer.
"Our clients have separated amicably and amicably," said the lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser according to "BamS."
The most important thing for them now is the well-being of their two daughters.
According to the report, the couple met in a pizzeria in 2003 and married two years later.
Joachim Llambi comes from Duisburg and was a successful tournament dancer and stockbroker.
Llambi became known on television through his jury work at the celebrity dance show "Let's Dance" on RTL, as well as through various appearances in quiz and entertainment programmes.
Arrests at demonstration in Barcelona
Barcelona - Demonstrations in Barcelona on Saturday led to clashes with the police.

Polls: 46 percent do not want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
After the quarrels of the past weeks, GroKo receives several survey lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday trend for Bild am Sonntag.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one counter to 17 percent, the SPD gives one point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lose one counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If there were a federal election on Sunday, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU would together receive only 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid.
As a result, the grand coalition has currently lost the majority on Sunday in all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently get 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election, they together received 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the range is also wide: the AfD, the second-strongest party in several polls, comes to 15 to 18%.
The Greens achieve vote shares of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left averages 10 percent, the FDP 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the share of the vote.
But popular support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also fallen significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens think that Merkel is the right person in the chancellorship, according to the Emnid survey commissioned by BamS.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the grand coalition to last until the next regular Bundestag election in three years, while 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
Another poll published on Saturday also showed a significant decline in Merkel's popularity.
The Germans are also divided as to whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour and 44 percent against.
64% of the Union's supporters therefore want to stand as candidates, while 35% do not.
Issue at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic get-to-know stories - should talk to Aldi about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket almost radiates an anachronistic romance as a place to get to know each other for great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer-short bargains at the volley table or the favorite pudding is still, in doubt, a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being less a contact exchange than a slippery one.
We dared the test: How do women react if you don't talk about the hot porridge for long in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
It has regular Hollywood lovestory potential when love happiness is preceded by an out-of-sight-lost-and-found plot.
If the guy then also reports to his beloved at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch @ gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is to be wished to the author of this advertisement in an Aldi branch unknown to us that she will also find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat."
For believing in the magic of getting to know each other analogue, she definitely deserves her happy ending à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgerischule has been participating in the campaign "Lid against polio - 500 lids for a life without polio."
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polio viruses.
The disease, called polio in German, leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polio viruses, can so far only be contained by vaccination, as stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc call for calm for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That doesn't do the boy any good.
And that doesn't do us any good, "said Reus, a friend of Götze, after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen on the TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the football league Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no hurry with a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We have not even talked about a treaty yet.
There is no fixed date when we will do this.
"But there will certainly be the moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl said on Sunday evening on the TV channel Sky.
Football: Bezirksliga: Researcher appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine is encouraging
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch took a hard line with his own.
He, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (internally) in order to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, things are running smoothly again on Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1: 1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the past season only razor-thin past the ascent.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
"We made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That was impressive, "Fetsch praised his boys and visited each individual after the match to simply say" thank you "for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited in the front for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his retirement (17.), the changed Luca Rehberg (26.) and Jan Schroer (38.) missed the lead.
This almost took revenge when the SCA hit the Wolbeck box twice in minute 41 in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL happily took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters narrowly failed.
Schroer also arrived too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes entry.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch once again gave the left side a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer felled Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free kick for the placeholders 18 meters in front of the guest housing.
The Gefoulte competed himself and demonstrated his dangerousness in standards.
Westhues "thing with the right slip hit the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1: 0 (71.).
20 minutes left, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck unhappily flew the leather in the penalty area in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to survive anxious minutes in the final phase, before Geske still had the winning goal on his head in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Perhaps it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4: 1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five match days - that could not be enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96 Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to take care of the first home victory.
Striker Ante Rebic, who was in the starting team for the first time after an injury, should help.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also back after a pubic injury and was supposed to prevent the SGE from scoring more goals according to standards with his head ball strength.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
During the landing, there was an accident at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m. on Sunday there was a drama at the airfield in Kottingbrunn.
When a helicopter landed, there was turbulence, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was caught by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a standstill on the side.
Immediately police, rescue and fire brigade were informed.
The emergency services came to the scene of the accident with a large contingent.
The ÖAMTC emergency medical helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one damage to property.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to go home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of investigation.
According to fire brigade spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire, which, however, could be extinguished quickly.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on company boards
This means that only 8 percent of the boards were female by the cut-off date of 1 September, as can be seen from the report "The Power of Monoculture," which will be officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was available to the German Press Agency in advance.
"Companies will have to position themselves differently, otherwise international competitors will pass them by," said Wiebke Ankersen, Managing Director of the Foundation.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male management teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
In comparison, the gap makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies is also solely due to positive impulses among the companies in the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
The proportion of women in the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will again recruit women more consistently in the coming year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signalled that they would continue to make no voluntary commitment to increase the share of "zero percent."
A different picture emerges from the supervisory boards: as of 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"If just as many women were recruited to the boards every year, a share of 40 percent would have been reached by 2023," the report says.
Some even make a mess: luxury bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari earns best.
The Italians earn 280,000 euros with every Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble suppliers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros with every car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even make a strong profit with every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices averaging 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in earnings before interest and taxes EBIT.

Torchlight procession for the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Wine Festival
The tourist office in Abtswind opened its wine festival session with a torchlight procession.
For the 60th time, the association organizes the wine festivals, which from now on take place every Saturday in October in the large marquee on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, those responsible moved through the village to the fairground under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn.
In the already prop-full marquee, the chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. "To organise something like this for 60 years - that is an insane achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that, "Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later toasted symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"It's great that so many have found their way to us in Abtswind again." Later, "Die Troglauer" created an atmosphere.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set the beverage prices as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival will take place on Friday, 5 October, in the guest's house, before the second round will take place one day later in the marquee.
In Bonn: Emergency car crashes in taxi
An emergency medical car stands badly damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passer-by was fatally injured in the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they are supposed to help - preferably even save lives.
Such a rescue trip came to a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in a collision between an emergency medical car and a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency medical car had crossed a red traffic light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then collided at an intersection with the taxi, which was driving at green.
The doctor's car hurled against a traffic light mast and a tree after the collision.
He caught the passerby who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of the emergency medical car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency medical car were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed by emergency services.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but she could no longer help the pedestrian.
Another summoned emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the public prosecutor's office in Bonn, are investigating who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we make it uncomfortable
After the disgraceful end of the League Cup, Manchester United now also loses in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United ManU is 1: 3. The way of defeat should still give us something to talk about.
The scene in the 74th minute, in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic shot 3-1 for West Ham, was emblematic; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Since they suspected an offside at the pass of Mark Nobel, all Manchester defenders stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of a performance that had already been insufficient for a long time.
The mood at Uniteds city rival Manchester City is completely different at the moment.
The Citizens, trained by Mourinho's great competitor Pep Guardiola, scored an uncompromised 2-0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour Raheem Sterling broke through the defensive bar of the outsider for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goal scorer, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer leader of the standings
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri won a 1-1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As in the Cup-Out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's goal in the 25th minute remained the only goal of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came into the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, narrowly missed the equalization after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds had started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea could not be beaten for the second time.
First the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, by the draw in the league the Blues Liverpool crashed now also from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, where Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait against the surprise team from the county Hertfordshire until the 81st minute for a success report.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defenseman Craig Cathcart unhappily scored Alex Iwobi's own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal passed Watford thanks to the fifth consecutive victory and is now immediately behind the big rival Tottenham in 5th place. Wolverhampton continues to leave a strong impression under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten in the 2-0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and finished 8th.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show under the banner of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue, but omnipresent: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of the German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
From next week, they will be showing their new products in the French capital at the 2018 Motor Show, together with competitors from all over the world.
Diesel no longer really plays a major role in this.
The possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin by then, are nevertheless likely to be an important topic, at least behind the brilliant scenes of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and, among other things, have their first pure electric models with them: the e-tron of the Ingolstadt-based company is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgart-based company in 2019.
But both have already been officially presented.
The iNext from BMW is not scheduled to start until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3-series.
A total of more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, more than one million visitors came.
At least 380 people lost their lives in the severe earthquakes and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communications and transport links have been damaged and enormous damage has been caused.
After the quakes, the tsunami hit the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a party.
It is feared that the number of victims will increase significantly.
The figures so far only come from Palu.
However, many other communities - along Sulawesis west coast - are also affected.
About 150 bikers celebrate divine service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for the motorcyclists in the Friedenskirche in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Friedenskirche in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the closing service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the engine pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the hp-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of each month at Haus Nordhelle.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
On Sunday, around 150 bikers gathered there to celebrate a service that was anything but ordinary.
Already from 10 o'clock the cars were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker's breakfast was on the program and it could be fortified with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given during the biker service by Father Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical background.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill strikes rather poetic and calm tones," says Father Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big party: After the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated step by step to his astonished spectators the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and then Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the large funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely chopped mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how it would become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to see this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which looked a little like chopped goods, layer by layer on top of each other.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the Füchtorf farmer also had ready-filled specialities with him.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest feather white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents got into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of pressing the apple, but also discovered the built bouncy castle for themselves.
Active members of the Füchtorf camaraderie of former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
Also in the coming year the Heimatverein will offer an action day.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of action.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the subject matter: after all, it will be all about milk.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season bankruptcy: "Shitty situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and encouraged them.
However, there were not many positive things to see before at the 1: 4 (0: 2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out there as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler and added: "This is of course disappointing, because you always plan a lot."
The still victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met for the connection, stand with two counters at the bottom and are in their current constitution a relegation candidate.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, however, Frankfurt celebrated its first home victory of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators, who moved into the middle of the table with seven points after the successful dress rehearsal for the European League match against Lazio Rom.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse at his starting eleven debut and could never be brought under control by Hanover's defense.
The striker, who was beaten for a long time after the World Cup, showed with his speed and assertiveness why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, borrowed from Liverpool FC, was also in the initial formation of the Frankfurt team for the first time, which began with momentum.
A header of Lucas Torró (17.) falsified on the goal net brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term failed Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a defensive corner, Haller extended his head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender who came from the French second division AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt followed suit before the break.
This time, Haller suited his storm partner Rebic, who skillfully wavered and left 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
In the half-time Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his team and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxons now played a little bolder forward, but there were no sparking ideas until shortly before the end, when the final goal was still possible.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After less than an hour Rebic started a solo and then laid across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only show running for the Frankfurt team against overstrained guests, Jovic also hit one minute before the end.
Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter made it in front of a million-strong audience at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two blows.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on 14 September or the Sunday after.
The festive divine service takes place in the city church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year-old war and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood then flowed from the gunshot wound.
From this developed a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This has not yet been completed, only the altar room stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his homily, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the Cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
The service was poorly attended despite its importance for the Geisinger parish.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and the church part of the Feast of the Cross ended with the final blessing.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting people to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish home.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue into next year.
After the scaffolding has been standing for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
What is certain is that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that already existed a few years ago has increased, but more has also been detected, which was only made possible by inspection by scaffolding.
The plastering work has been completed, the natural stone work is to begin before the winter and it is hoped that more than half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New dormitory in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new dormitory for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that "a very special house" is now being handed over to its destination in Münsterblickstraße - all those present agreed on this at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the dormitory of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader took into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officer building of the US Army was put to the test for the residents with mobile phone caps: "The house was getting old and no longer up to date in terms of equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved in to demolish the house.
According to the architect, the new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in time and financially.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which let the residents experience the freedom to move even without outside help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, expressed a similar opinion: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its residents, who need aids in order to be mobile."
The cosiness and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it can no longer be acquired in today's situation."
In total, the new dormitory on Münsterblickstraße offers space on almost 1500 square metres for 30 people with disabilities, who are divided into three residential groups.
Lebenshilfe managing director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariff.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before Unity Day, Manuela Schwesig, deputy chairman of the SPD, appealed to all compatriots not to resign themselves to the discrimination against East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences, "said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the" Tagesspiegel am Sonntag. "
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germans worked longer on average than people in West Germany, but received 15 percent less salary.
"Almost 30 years after German unification, I cannot explain this to anyone," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs as a gift.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, about a year old, reached their recipient on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food in order to "make it easier for the animals to get used to it."
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to jointly apply to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri missile propulsion test facility.
Austria's eventful history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this year of remembrance for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published, most of which answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archives, takes a completely different approach in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to technical work - this is the unofficial motto for the Grand Coalition's working week, which begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, the SPD and also from the CSU last but not least mantra-like invoked the "return to technical work."
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what the difference is between work and technical work, but so be it.
When the Federal Government is ready to return to its mission - governing - it should not now be prevented from doing so by means of conceptual debates.
Monday may already show whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet for the coalition committee.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, with the diesel retrofits and the law on the immigration of skilled workers, conflict-prone issues are once again on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get off lightly with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to retrofit older diesel.
While the diesel crisis has shown signs of rapprochement over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart on the planned law on the immigration of skilled workers.
The SPD calls for a permanent perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or undergo training.
The Union is firmly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute among the coalition partners - and how could it be otherwise?
Not Gleich und Gleich has joined forces to form GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without controversy, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests will not make progress.
But in order to be constructive, quarrel must not be exaggerated again for party tactical reasons to the question of being or not being.
This is still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD should argue - but always keep an eye on the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be resolved pragmatically - and thus trust can be regained.
Above all, that is what the popular parties must now fight for.
Mushroom checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the sights
Does the Minister of Labour, of all people, violate the current law on service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" their legists had worked on the social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
List mushroom mandator Daniela Holzinger is surprised by the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via question.
She assumed that "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and in no way wanted to announce violations of current service law in front of running cameras."
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to "absolve Har tinger of any suspicion."
Police tear open a street in search of women's corpses
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, excavations have been taking place on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is still closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
This was preceded by the fact that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to limit the relevant place to a few metres together with its guide in repeated use.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said stretch of road.
For more than a year now, the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Criminal Investigation Court have been working on the case of missing persons.
Again and again a cycle path was closed at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heike's body could have been buried here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonia's anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But there are riots even before that.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017, there were clashes between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence activists with paint powder, among other things, to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to hold a rally to honour their colleagues who were deployed in the polling stations last year in the referendum, which was classified as illegal.
Violence also occurred at the time in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the approximately 6000 separatists then tried by force to break through the police chain and threw paint bags and eggs at the officers, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, it was said, citing the authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region from Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also set off abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the Catalans "" right to self-determination. "
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate without a goal
Red and white Ahlen continues to stand still.
Also at Gütersloh FC it was only enough for a 0-0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion, they turned out to be perplexed.
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor.
Those who therefore preferred to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so without any worries.
There was no danger of missing a scoring chance, because there was virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire match in the 28th minute.
The Ahlener had the best - and in principle only real - possibility, when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty line.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel aimed from 18 meters just above the housing and after an hour also the Gütersloher appeared offensively for the first time.
After a shooting conquest by Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed.
Nick Flock (62.) "crowned" the quick counter over Sinan Aygün with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also followed up with a header from Wieckowicz (66.) after a corner ball from former Ahleners Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It worked - nothing.
The Ahlener did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but even that brought nothing.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like the fact that we played to zero." But unfortunately the zero was also at the front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent had no desire to play here," stated RW Ahlen's interim coach.
On the offensive, "everything splashed a bit" against a team "that just wanted to defend.
In any case, I did not have the feeling that we could get a counter-goal, "says Daut.
To his chagrin, however, one did not have the feeling as a spectator that his team could score a goal.
The performance was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Luckily there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for whom these donations are intended, are pleased about this.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the square was still a little empty, but that was to change during the day.
Because: "Here it is so nice sociable, that's why we are here today," said a visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a good pinch of humor.
Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer stepped in at short notice for the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed up against food.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" did not miss the opportunity to entertain the increasing number of visitors musically in between.
This was so well received that some folk songs were sung along at a late hour.
"Just great," said Marcel Kreimer happily.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to include the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased about the many active people with their booths, including mainly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a blackboard," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all those who were on duty at the stands and also included the other festivals that took place in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden city gives itself a colourful coat of paint - something is possible here.
Then the May wreath was taken off by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarters.
Many booths were used for physical well-being.
From sweet to heartfelt, everything was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his decupier saw.
He had veneers, coasters with Reckenfelder motifs and much more on offer.
Three Reckenfelder beekeepers offered a specialty: "Reckenfelder Honig," brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter still has a specialty with it.
Honey cake in a glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to access it again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that made the visitors linger for a long time into the evening hours, even without a stage programme, which does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubricants with a local political message: No successful advertising for skate facilities
In Lengerich, unknown persons have hardly promoted the construction of a skate facility in a conducive way.
There are corresponding lubricants in several places, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.
The three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" are emblazoned in large letters on signs at the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering had already been discovered on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt bistro after the professional election fair on 19 September.
Since the short message was apparently "only" left with an Edding at the time, it could have been removed without any problems.
"A few days later, however, it was back, this time sprayed on," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
This case is given a special touch by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate facility is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.
However, it is quite possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to the companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate facilities.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The majority of the Council finally voted in favour of the fire brigade parking lot.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against construction at this point.
A U-turn followed at the end of June.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously in favour of the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The city council then has the last word.
He expects a decision this year, so that a positive vote could lead to construction in 2019.
Air traffic control bottleneck gets even worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control union, to the German Press Agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known shortage of staff in European air traffic control, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Across Europe, the market for fully trained pilots has been swept away.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, around a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various aviation trade unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the federal government, the Länder, air traffic control, the airlines and the airports will meet in the Hanseatic city on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work densification and overtime, this will not be possible without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the federal German air traffic control.
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission for the pilot misery.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings in national air traffic control systems are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut off air traffic control even further."
At present, the EU requirements are being agreed by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is under constant lobbying pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," said Maas.
He hoped that the high cost of delays would lead to a rethink on the part of the airlines.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," said Maas.
The previously announced admission of 120 pilots per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary personnel development is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for corporate restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to Thyssenkrupp interim CEO Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at Sunday's meeting, the crisis-ridden group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff cuts beyond the already known cuts in administration.
After two resignations, the supervisory body on the capital side has only eight heads.
This is contrasted with ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a Annual General Meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with its Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business with elevators and supplies is to be bundled.
Barcelona: Violence at demonstrations by police and Catalan independence supporters.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona have resulted in violent clashes with many injured.
According to the city administration, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, when about 6000 independence supporters also demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a large contingent to keep the two protest trains away from each other.
According to the forces, however, independence supporters repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and projectiles.
According to the information, there were also fights between the participants in the various protest marches.
According to rescue services, 24 people were injured.
The police reported that there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who had taken action almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators found it provocative that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona, of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drowned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Breakdown allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A security hole in a mobile phone app has led to the personal details of ministers and Conservative British Tory MPs being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from strangers after the breakdown became known a day before the Tory Party Congress in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hanover police reported a serious traffic accident on the federal road 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people lost their lives when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The emergency services are on the ground.

Football: Juve coach praises after top match: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3-1 (1-1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive star was the decisive man in the important match against the pursuer, even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we grew.
Thanks to the three goals of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early delay by the goal of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung the worst pursuer for the time being.
The goalkeeper brought in by Real Madrid first put on the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26 / 49.).
And Ronaldo also did the preparatory work for the goal of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76.) after a corner by header ball, who only had to push in shortly before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We have to get even better at serving him," demanded the coach.
The best Juve goal scorer is currently Mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three in his account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to become even more overwhelming.
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in Series A. With 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six points advantage over Naples.
The table width trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the relegation of Mario Rui (58.), who had already been warned, the top match was decided.
The Portuguese had to leave the pitch with yellow-red after too hard a start against Paulo Dybala.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German national player has prevailed at Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool FC, was involved in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri meant by the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the 2-0 victory of the Turin team and is closed for the home match on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly bizarre appearance, rapper Kanye West attracted attention at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" at the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frown and question marks among the audience.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change just in time for the release of his new album.
From now on he should only be called "Ye," according to the musician.
"The being formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince when he took his stage name.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
Already the tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think" Ye "is the most used word in the Bible and there it means" you, "" says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Created!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was simply more handy, we almost never presented him with problems. "The list of Hoetmarer shooting possibilities reads correspondingly thin.
Grade two scoring chances in 90 minutes, so that only rarely games can be designed positively.
Football Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is defeated by SG Sendenhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first round, but Maik Krause used the first from a sharp angle for the early lead (7.).
In the 43rd minute Steffen Uphus could have raised, but after great preparatory work by Krause he squandered free standing.
The hosts only had a double chance when Moritz Höne initially failed due to goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and in the aftershot Jan Blome also found his champion in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all awarded.
Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use a trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stabbed the ball over the line was the match decided (81.).
"We had criticized each other hard before, that was different today than in the last weeks," was the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0: 1 Krause (7.), 0: 2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75. / Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh defeated Concordia with 3: 4
"I don't know what to think about it," he struggled for words.
"We didn't get any access to them at all." By them he presumably meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green whites, who stood out with a collective offensive drive.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he still said, winking cheekily and pulling from there His players, on the other hand, were relieved to note that they had pulled themselves out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class preservation.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes that lay behind him.
"This was by far our best performance of the season," he says.
"How we come back after the 0-2, how we hold against one of the top teams in the league over the entire season, that was really phenomenal."
This makes it all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner brought the hosts into the lead with his 12th goal of the season (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He put the 2-0 over the left side exemplary for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take such a player out completely.
"That was madness, what he did," Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of the opponent without envy.
Shortly before the side change, his own team managed to equalize: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long toreck (45.).
After the side change it was McGill again who scored the equalization (59.).
After that it went back and forth.
It was a cracking, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann compensated (69.).
Despite the majority, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80.).
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten is what we now have to win," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Goals: 1: 0 Zymner (24.), 2: 0 Fröhning (39.), 2: 1 McGill (45.), 2: 2 McGill (59.), 3: 2 Nübel (64.), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74. / Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The leader of the standings had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0-0.
Media: General Executive Committee of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire executive committee of second division football player Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
In the evening, several media unanimously referred to a joint letter from the Board of Saxony.
A confirmation of the association was not available at first.
The reason for the withdrawal is supposed to be internal power struggles at the former Bundesliga player.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
Good that he's gone again.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many had said that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 conferences until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he will personally collect the tolerance prize in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was a guest there.
This is how academy director Udo Hahn calculated him when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors have already been with us." However, the fact that celebrities repeatedly appear at the academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic during the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, and on 29 September the writer Frido Mann takes part in a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged to personally accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which television presenter Dunja Hayali also receives in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it all.
"The pension is just not safe!" is written in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting on Syria:" Barbarism without limit. "
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - war makes a mockery of any humane idea. "
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change in work through digitisation.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a conference on the 200th anniversary.
Karl Marx's birthday is coming soon, some expect more visitors to the direction of capitalism criticism, others rather a tendency "from the far left to the centre."
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music Cabaret: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner imagined gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there might be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes speaks until the end of the movement, and on the other hand, a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies him so congenially and harmoniously that some may have wished for a solo.
This was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, namely as it suited the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, would be of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: what would have arisen from composing Mozart if "Das Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
Thus Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" to the "Lied vom Tod," and from Mozart's G minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, presented flowers to the chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not let an additional thanks be taken away.
She had the idea to give the duo one in Wolbeck in addition to appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

The controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk is allowed to remain CEO of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, but has to relinquish the chairmanship of the board.
Musk also agreed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pay a double-digit million fine, the SEC announced.
The background is Musk's surprising announcement in August that he would take Tesla off the stock exchange.
In its lawsuit, the SEC accused Musk of providing false and misleading information.
Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police slightly revised the number of victims downwards.
10 instead of 15 passengers were slightly injured.
All of them have now been released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had remained in hospital for one night for observation.
He will be released during the day, said a police spokesman.
The cause of the accident of the long-distance bus near Bruchsal is still unclear.
The long-distance bus had crashed head-on against a guardrail on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women 's Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlenerinnen had problems above all with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who marked ten goals alone.
"Actually, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We didn't get a grip on them, "says ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed about the many missed opportunities.
The concentration in the conclusion was missing his team this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end behind a gap, was at the break with 11: 12 and later still with 15: 18 (45.) behind.
Only towards the end did the broader bank of the hostesses make itself felt decisively.
In addition, Aydogdu placed Merle Klement on the far left, which then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5 / 3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of BSV Ostbevern in the top match at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
At the second league relegation VC Allbau Essen the blue-whites won with 3: 1.
"That was a giant step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the upper third of the league.
We have now worked this out, "said coach Dominik Münch happily after an almost impeccable performance of his team at the overthrown leader of the standings.
The guests dominated the first round almost at will.
Over 4: 1, 16: 10 and 22: 12 he went with 25: 15 to the runner-up of the previous year.
Food has accepted in the two-bar, but has not come into play.
We kept them busy.
Our opponent hit with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12: 8. "Essen has changed the acceptance to three bars.
We could not keep the impact pressure.
Food has sucked in, and we have let ourselves be lulled a bit, "Münch continues.
At 18: 17, the volleyball players from the Ruhr area were ahead for the first time.
Although Ostbevern still resisted four set balls at 19: 24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now one class better," said the trainer to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly with their serve to the fact that the BSV turned the hand in the third section from 14: 16 to 25: 21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly."
Over 7: 3 and 15: 13 the blue-whites brought passage four with 25: 22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the large Ditib mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of ruins in German-Turkish relations that can only be brought together with difficulty," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, to the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of emphasizing the affiliation of Muslims to Germany side by side with German leaders, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," complained Sofuoglu.
The extensive exclusion of the German public had "reinforced many reservations."
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break is finally Folktreff time again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 pm, the Heimatverein Nottuln is already organising its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost to the day it was a year ago that we held a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln, "says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our folk meeting would take place so quickly in Nottuln eta.
Whether storm Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always full.
"As always, the programme at the next Folktreff is a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has agreed to the first folk meeting "birthday" with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling," a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with Low German lyrics.
Now he is on the road with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff like to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten enthused the audience with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a convivial and humorous evening once again," says the invitation of the Heimatverein.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to get actively involved is invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 pm, but admission is already at 7 pm.
China clears proposed merger between Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking a further step forward on their way to becoming the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This means that the multi-billion dollar merger still has to be approved in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA.
Most recently, according to an insider, the chances of obtaining approval there had improved because Linde had promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On 29 September 1893 the last founding impulses for the district association for horticulture and state care Kulmbach were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, his name was still different at the time: as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land," he was founded by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit growing association also differed from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit growing, nobody thought about flowers and horticulture at that time.
"At that time, in the epoch of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favourite child of the elites," explained district home keeper Günter Dippold in his festive lecture.
Fruit trees were to line highways, so-called industrial gardens were created at schools.
Fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7,000 members.
But that is far from exhausting the spectrum.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village embellishment and nutrition play just as important a role as imparting knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are in an entertaining way on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
Chestnut collecting was a huge matter for us children, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with your smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with District Administrator Klaus Peter Söllner on the occasion of the anniversary.
"Where they should stand is decided by the district association," added District Administrator Söllner and stressed the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
That this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district, also district managing director and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun left no doubt.
He led the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the district association and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came from the garden, for the winter it was doused.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden had turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature exists, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves towards it," pleaded the expert for fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living in.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian State Association.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe that to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was ceremoniously framed by the tower brass of the Thurnau Music Association.

Priority on NAFTA talks: Canada's Foreign Minister postpones UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on NAFTA: it is giving both trading partners an ultimatum to reach an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister is now giving absolute priority to the trade deal - and postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure in the struggle for a new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the Minister will not address the United Nations General Assembly until Monday, said her spokesman Adam Austen.
In the meantime, it is focusing on renegotiating NAFTA.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canadian and US negotiators would have 48 hours to reach an agreement if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the US.
The US and Mexico agreed in August on a recast of the NAFTA regional free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump hinted that Canada could be excluded from NAFTA in the future.
Discussions on a new edition have been going on for more than a year.
They are now to be concluded by Sunday evening (local time), and Trump's administration wants to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.
These are the most dangerous roads in Hanover.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left hospital.
According to a report in the daily newspaper "O Globo," the far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives.
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician was attacked in the street at the beginning of September during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations mobilized against Bolsonaro's racist and contemptuous statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers "Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As the former mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has long been involved in politics, but has recently emerged as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieves an absolute majority in the first round of voting, there will be a run-off on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from it successfully, no matter against whom he competes.
Bolsonaro is known for inciting against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time, he said supporters of Lula's left-wing Workers' Party should be shot.
Europe takes back Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale at the gates of Paris.
The outsider team of captain Thomas Björn dethroned the favored defending champion USA by a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators on the three days at Le Golf National with great blows and outstanding team spirit.
After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
On his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin ', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 70s.
Their songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in all hearts."
The head of the government also recalled that Larsen, an opponent of the monarchy, had appeared in 2010 on the occasion of the 70th birthday of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.
Rocknacht in der Schuhfabrik: Volume at pneumatic hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock by three bands friends.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert starts, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of stage fright.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - and their bands loudly inspire the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening also with newest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the soon to be released CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to the harmonious and powerful interaction.
Although "encore" calls cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand."
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that hard rock is not the same as hard rock with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers," "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to guitar rock.
Not only the yearning, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" captivates by the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, however, has gained a special reputation since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their hard rock on Saturday.
It is obvious and unmistakable that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann sets his own accents in cooperation with the band on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In addition to the sound, which feels even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a highly acclaimed solo, running through the audience.
A certain volume is of course part of such a hard rock concert due to rain: At the "Mint Mosquito" - Rocknacht, according to information from the mixing desk team, it is about 98 decibels at the three-piece concert of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition."
This is at the level of pneumatic hammer, for example, but is still significantly below the controls of the "Wacken Fesitval," to which "The Ignition" refer on their website.
However, the Ahlen audience does not need a deafening 120 decibels in jet engine volume, as is customary at the annual metal rendezvous in the north of the republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking gait have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in the figurative sense, can say at the end.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in glider accident at Essen / Mülheim airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim / Essen airport.
A glider crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim / Essen airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim / Essen airport on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider had crashed on the trade fair parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is supposed to be a one-seater.
The plane had already been in the approach to land at the time of the accident.
The crash site is only a short distance from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
The airport Mülheim / Essen is located at the city border of the two Ruhr cities and directly at the entrance to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park & Ride offer at large events in the Messe Essen or the Gruga-Halle in Essen.
Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that US President North Korea's leader, Kim, is well disposed, despite the nuclear crisis.
Now, however, Trump has made a veritable declaration of love to his colleague.
This also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has committed himself to a new flame.
The tragic thing is that it is a long-distance relationship.
In public on Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
In front of supporters in West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old offspring of Pyongyang's ruling dynasty, even though it is proving to be a tough chunk in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, he was tough, and things went back and forth between us," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And it was not only the talks with Kim that would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump has referred to Kim's announcement of a halt to all nuclear and missile tests, even if critics have so far seen little more than lip service.
The US president seemed well aware that affection for the notorious "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - might not be hers.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism of this when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But he cares very little, Trump explained, and then pointed his index finger at the crowd: "I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidential."
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there pushing into this packed arena, we would only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler best visited, atmospheric as well as spoiled by sun full: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair Baesweiler's city center cleaned up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest did not only take place in the marquee at the fire brigade tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to highlight their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya, enabling them to be rescued.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July at the risk of their lives and distributed it online.
"They refuse to send us back," one man said in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers," whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we would probably not have been able to return to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told the AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
According to his own statement, he put his life in danger with the video.
One of his comrades-in-arms was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the prison conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back home this year with the help of the program, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians who have now been rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor prison conditions in Libya.
However, he has not yet heard of a call for help via mobile phone video.
International organisations have long criticised the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the local elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
Around 4: 50 p.m., the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the anteroom of the first floor, she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police, who started the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot yet be said.
Description of the perpetrator: approx. 16 years old, black, very short hair, somewhat darker appearance, dark trousers, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the police inspectorate Obernberg am Inn, telephone number 059.133.4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in Central Franconia, after he had stuck the car off all forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and freed the missing person since Tuesday evening, the police announced on Sunday.
According to the data, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he failed to return from a trip with his SUV across the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search measures, the whereabouts of the man had remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls for the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has, according to his own statements, called for the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This applies above all to waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He had therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this."
According to Laschet, he also raised the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved at short notice to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's flight readiness at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their interlocutors - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of trust in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump never tires of emphasizing the successes of North Korea's denuclearization negotiations, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to be accommodating.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has accused the US government in the UN General Debate of using its continuing sanctions to block negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
"The recent stalemate comes as the US is relying on coercive measures that are fatal to confidence-building," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
That punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" is "a pipe dream of people who do not know us."
In order to build trust, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri pointed out.
However, there had been no "corresponding reactions" from the US side, the minister criticised.
Last year alone, the UN Security Council adopted sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times over North Korea's nuclear and missile programme.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pressing the United Nations in recent days for strict compliance with the punitive measures.
At the same time, the US government is working on rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang again for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The many visitors to the House of the Open Door HoT did not notice that they were actually in a youth meeting place: white blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then came the bad surprise on the first day after the summer break: a power outage had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to make it alone," says Westbuer.
And so everyone got involved.
The result was impressive, the guests were thrilled.
"Chefs can't do any better," praised a visitor impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It is really great what the children and young people have set up," stressed Father Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen caused astonishment with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW board of directors of the Tafel
Out of frustration at criticism from his own ranks, Jörg Sartor, head of the Essen Tafel, has resigned from his position in the regional association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen table had introduced a stop to the admission of foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice-head of the NRW boards, said Sartor to the "Welt am Sonntag."
Too many have fallen in my back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed understanding to the dpa for the decision of his long-time deputy.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his step - people have said that they did not know exactly why the Essen table is doing this."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other boards in the "Welt am Sonntag."
One should not take the approach that "without us, the people in the city will starve."
It is the task of the state to ensure that people do not starve to death.
The Essen man did not take part in a congress of the panels on Friday in Berlin.
"I am told too much sweet schmus," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis who criticised me in this way at the time.
SF Lorch lose 2: 0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, Bezirksliga Lorch loses against newcomers 2: 3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after a delay - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2: 0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home match against the TV newcomer - in the end it was 2: 3 and the disappointment among the sports friends was great.
Completely different the TV Heuchlingen: In Kirchheim the TVH quickly fell behind with 0: 1, won after 90 minutes however with 2: 1. At the top of the table the SGB could meanwhile with a 3: 0
Gladbach playful two-time lead - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for an away victory in Wolfsburg.
In the 2: 2 the foals lose a lead twice.
Schalke wins against Mainz for the first time of the season (1: 0).
(sda) Schalke has manoeuvred himself into the sidelines four times in the first five league games with early opponents.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco showed again the strength with which it had taken first place behind the Bavarians last season.
Alessandro Schöpf brought the home quipe into the lead in the eleventh minute after strong preparatory work by Yevgeny Konoplyanka per head, in the consequence the hosts preserved the mini-cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback Borussia Dortmund greets again from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had scored a 0-2 gap against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came to a 4-2 victory in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) compensated with a doublette within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided with another doublette in the final phase (86. / 94.) for the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break.
VfB Stuttgart also scored its first victory.
In the meantime, the Stuttgart team had to fear Werder Bremen, which had already been decimated before the break due to a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler produced a strange throw-in own goal, which helped the guests to balance in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also not a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbach team, which competed with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave up a lead twice, finally played 2: 2 and has been waiting for an away victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen and his second Bundesliga player were responsible for Wolfsburg's 1-1 equalisation.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargau, as well as in the second counter-hit after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa proves to be a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase, which came from the OGC Nice, met for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh compulsory game.
After seven laps Gladbach takes 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously undefeated Werder Bremen manoeuvred itself into an uncomfortable situation against VfB Stuttgart.
After 19 minutes the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first goal of the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: The 23-year-old Serb collected yellow-red after a jersey hit against Daniel Didavi.
Although Stuttgart defenseman Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremen team back into the game with a curious own goal (68.), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgart team back on the road to victory.
Nuremberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3-0.
After half an hour Hanno Behrens already put the home team on track with a foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state name
In Macedonia today, around 1.8 million citizens are voting on whether to change the name of their country to Northern Macedonia.
A "yes" vote could resolve the nearly three-decade-old conflict with its neighbor, Greece.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and had blocked any rapprochement between Macedonia and the West.
Voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member if the referendum had a positive outcome.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three pensioners and injured them, some of them seriously.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted on Friday at around 10 p.m. in the Fluchtgasse in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they approached the accused, who attacked passers-by with clenched fists and tried to attack them, about his behaviour.
The Syrian then tried to beat and kick the officers.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had just beaten three older ladies (65, 67, 75) to the ground with his fists at a tram stop in Währinger Straße.
He had also trampled the trio underfoot.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for unknown reasons," as the police said.
He was taken to hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two said yes to each other on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"When we get married, it's right." He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir with an angry speech on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the right to adopt.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the Bürgervereinigung Kinderhaus and the Gesellschaft für Leprakunde.
Around 400 metres of hedge around the gardens of the residents of the Pfründnerhaus were to be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We are doing this in order to reduce costs," said the chairman of the citizens "association Walter Schröer.
And a lot has accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but luckily it is now only a form cut.
Because already in the spring the hedge had been shortened once.
The breakfast, which always follows the work, also has a long tradition.
"Everyone should stay with their strength," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the World Canoe Slalom Championships
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg won the gold medal at the end of the World Canoe Slalom Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, I already had enough rides here on the facility and everything was right today, "said the Olympic third from London 2012.
At the finish, he threw away his paddle with joy and raised both arms victoriously - knowing full well that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had start number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech Jiri Prskavec finished second ahead of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The police inspection Gauting reports the first burglary attempt this autumn in a single-family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to take advantage of that again.
Yesterday, for example, the Gauting Police Inspection reported the first attempted burglary this autumn.
The fact that it remained at the single-family house on Königswieser Straße is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday shortly before 8 p.m.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them to such an extent that they fled without prey.
Notes to PI Gauting, Phone (089) 8.93.13.30.
Bust at Hertha: Catched up by reality: Bavaria demanded against Ajax
The title is unbeatable: FC Bayern "does not want to put up with" the defeat in Berlin.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance dip under the new coach Niko Kovac should not increase to a larger autumn low for the Munich team.
"A week ago, there was still the impression that we were invincible.
Now reality has caught up with us a bit, "stated Thomas Müller after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are accelerating towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no own goal was scored abroad, as at the same time of the preseason two compulsory games in series without victory, the lead in the Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund for the time being.
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as it was at the end of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at the 1: 1 with its loud man-against-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitches over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, how the last appearing overpowering Bavarians are to be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not put up with this and that we will do everything we can to be successful again," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, however, he dealt surprisingly gently with his losers in his native city and merely blamed his first defeat as a Munich coach on the once again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim conclusion of his term of office positive before the international break - otherwise the tone is likely to intensify.
So Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second premier class appearance of this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax begins as planned, which had also defeated AEK Athens with 3-0 at the start.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also score our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke plainly.
The right-wing defender appeared in the role as a warning.
"I don't think all this is bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the multitude of chances and make the mistakes at the back," stressed the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavarians were even five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with one point advantage.
And so Kimmich assessed with a wink at least positively that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavarians has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the international.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in the firing line: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for the sovereignty of interpretation in the permanent controversial topic Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticized the handling of the ex-world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB boss defended the association line.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally sharply attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the cause in the ZDF- "Sportstudio" in Mainz.
"In future - because we also have many players with a migrant background in the U-teams - we will have to draw very precise conclusions that this will not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win an international player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel once again declared that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had sharply denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they had themselves photographed with me in England, "Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
Frankly, as their president, I could not stomach the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, in contrast to Özil, he felt "sensibly treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would stand in front of players in the future.
That someone says: if I win, I am German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that is not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I have always said that.
But he also does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed in addition to the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background clearly influences society and football and says:" The topic is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the end of the World Cup and the Özil affair, he intends to run for the office of DFB President again next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as possible," Grindel said.
Jähriger builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg / Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 am and 1 pm.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic lights in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no exchange of personnel, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone report about a driver who had left the road and driven against a guide post.
Asked about this, the man did not want any police on the spot and then drove away.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner got lost in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Finally, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could no longer remember many things.
The damage amounts to approximately 1300 euros.
Moor fire in Meppen: Almost 1000 volunteers are still in action.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the bog fire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 volunteers are still busy with the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop in a stable way, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of volunteers is planned, it is said.
During the night to Sunday an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster was lifted, which was declared just over a week earlier on 21 September, because it was feared that the flames would endanger adjacent forests and settlements due to wind and sparks.
On Thursday it was then said that the fire would no longer threaten to spread to neighbouring communities.
At times, more than 1500 volunteers tried to control the large-scale fire on the ground.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "tornadoes" are also planned for 2 and 5 October.
The fire was triggered by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the bog fire had temporarily moved up to one hundred kilometres far over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr intends to set up a contact point to receive claims for damage.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two said yes to each other on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
When we get married, it's right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir with an angry speech on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the right to adopt.
Referendum started in Macedonia on new state name
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should in future be called Northern Macedonia.
Neighbouring Greece insists on this because of its northern province of the same name.
As a means of exerting pressure, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote "yes," they will also give the starting signal for their country's Western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from oblivion
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the US in 2016, leaving behind a work that preserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes will then be available from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases a card is found at the decisive moment with possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Agency for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"There is no register in which people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation on organ donation.
Under his proposal, anyone would initially be considered an organ donor unless they or relatives object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in mental arithmetic
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in mental arithmetic.
He prevailed against 39 comrades-in-arms at the weekend in Wolfsburg.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as main referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14.130.214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, in which participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was already in Bielefeld two years ago as a 14-year-old.
Organizer Laue has little to do with terms such as superbrain, genius or child prodigy.
"Head arithmetic can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stage-based arithmetic competitions.
One of the disciplines, for example, is square root pulling from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, candidates are given surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans would also have a good chance here, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often at an advantage, because mental arithmetic is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods even in early childhood.
Urgent appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer screening
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows her emotional and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer and campaign for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings topless the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about breast cancer screening that can save lives.
Serena Williams herself almost died a year ago.
There were complications with the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
An emergency operation was initiated to save the baby's life.
During a subsequent CT, blood clots were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a draft law on the so-called "Symbols Act" for review.
The aim is to significantly expand the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Mrs. Holle shakes out her beds for the first time next week in the west: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit falls to 1,500 to 1,200 metres at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it could snow down to about 1,000 metres at high intensity, it was said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions therefore become wintry.
Farmers are allowed to start annual buckling care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start annual buckling care on Monday.
The "green ramparts," which are unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor federal state for about 200 years.
The tree and scrub hedges, which are up to five metres wide, are "forest replacements" and the last retreats for many animals and plants.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats, over which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the managing director of the nature protection federation Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of an order of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and cattle fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also dates back to that time: by "bending" the branches, the dense, intertwined demarcations could develop.
Today, around 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a wooded, variously structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a substitute habitat by around 7,000 animal species.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometre of bend and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the bend can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Otherwise it will atrophy into a light row of trees, which will lose not only biodiversity but also wind protection, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, buckling care may only be carried out outside the breeding season from October to March.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about SItuation on site
In an interview with the German Editorial Network (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and tsunami:
Were you there yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at that time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport on Palu was closed at that time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills, where they are still holding out for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The civil service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the prisoners walk around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does the communication and information supply on the island work?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that it didn't work and we only got information via the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people they do not know if they live and where they are because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We do not know the reasons for this, but when the all-clear came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then it came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami was hitting the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, which lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has affected a great many people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to do without Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing VfB Stuttgart with serious muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo suffered a muscle fiber rupture in the rear left thigh at the 2-1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga football team announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle rupture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not make a forecast for the downtime.
A muscle bundle rupture usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber rupture usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival closes the ranks of the most prestigious European festivals every year.
Despite all the farewells to the cinema, one can sum up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching fire brigade tried to catch an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers at Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the area of the water guard station.
In order to help the animal, passers-by called the police and fire brigade.
The first attempts to capture the duck, however, went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the emergency services again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and push it back to land, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a courageous grip.
The duck injured on the chest was then taken to the veterinary clinic of the LMU in Oberschleissheim.
But according to initial assessments, their chances of survival are rather slim.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard is aiming for World Championship medal
Fourth place at Olympia was long in the stomach of biathlete Julian Eberhard.
Next winter, the Saalfeldener wants to make up for the missed precious metal at the World Championships in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old the medal within reach in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang.
Seven tenths of a second were missing in the end on bronze.
"I deliberately took my time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
This makes the Pinzgauer all the more motivated to make up for the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point you have to strike.
The World Championship track in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard's: "I have already taken the track to heart," he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN) last World Cup winter.
With the relay he finished second in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at a turbo pace
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation at a turbo pace, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the razor-thin majority for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial on charges of coercion.
President Donald Trump has given investigators until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The latest turn in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's appointment, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing between Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer issued angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee was supposed to clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative US Supreme Court judge.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when, contrary to his original announcement, Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had called Thursday's serious accusations "shelling," initially refrained from further attacks on women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune."
In this way, final doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
They will specifically investigate the well-known accusations of two women, nothing more, a government representative told the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit will be stationed on Gartenstraße from Monday, 1 October.
The Federal School Centre is also located there.
The municipality also operates several permanently installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first victory of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first victory of the season.
Nevertheless, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home match against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in there.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area, "said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed a sigh of relief.
After all, the royal blue had managed to wrap up the close 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season.
In fact, things could have turned out differently.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco security: "Overall, the first half was good, both playfully and in terms of pressing," obviously more and more the head played a role with increasing playing time.
Schöpf actually no head-ball monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore withdrew further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from our hearts," said Schöpf, who played no insignificant part in this with his head ball hit: "I am actually the worst head ball player in the team."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start powerfully in the initial phase and make fireworks out of it," said Schalke's head coach.
The victory was important.
Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau missed to worry about clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the bar twice 59th / 72nd or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have been a trembling victory," said Tedesco: "You have already felt the fear a little."
I am therefore pleased that we have won.
This meant that he was not the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke could not be overlooked.
From a distance of about two kilometres, a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire on Sunday at around 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - Police and fire brigade soon found out the cause: an unknown person had set fire to garbage on a two-square-metre area on Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it seemed that he had monitored the fire for a long time, but then left the embers unattended.
And this near the forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were busy pulling apart and extinguishing.
The police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on an equal footing
In front of them stands the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has once again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Kulturpolitik" in the organisation of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic in a comprehensible way.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and one or the other joke, he brings one of the most conflict-ridden topics closer to the audience: migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, are conflicts increasingly arising?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table sits German society, at the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to come to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to have a say.
This leads to conflicts.
The decisive factor is therefore not whether one classifies oneself politically on the right or on the left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?," he emphasizes.
At first rather restrained, then the discussion round starts more and more lively.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands in front of, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Also during the subsequent signing session he still has an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, was discussed intensively further.
Basketball: Bonn and Giessen win opening games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first match day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away victory.
Giessen prevailed in a hard-fought match in its own hall with 91: 84 (43: 46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonner won at the BG Göttingen with 86: 79 (49: 47).
Alba Berlin is the first leader of the season after the 112: 55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champion Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich already struggled on Friday to an 83: 77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg on Saturday with 84: 80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is obviously huge: More than 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the plots in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new Landsham-Süd development area on the open market.
This is reported by Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots offered by the municipality at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the former local model - has been completed.
According to Frick, a good 100 applications have been received.
"The documents are currently being examined," with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Plieningen, the aim is to have drawn up the list of applicants for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
After that, the award could take place.
A total of 50 plots of land for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-family houses with an expected eight residential units each.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and paths are to be paved soon.
One individual property and two of the apartment buildings belong to a private individual, the rest to the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots of land in a socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two apartment buildings of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments supported by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated, housing for about 200 people will be created on the area of the new Landsham-Süd development area.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start of the new construction of a day care center is taking place there.
It will house three kindergarten and three crèche groups as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
Schalke's Naldo "great sport" also succeeds on the bench
Not in the starting team for the third time in a row: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not sat in the Schalker starting team for the third time in a row, but on the replacement bench, the understanding of many people would have been great if the almost two-metre-tall Brazilian had really talked about his frustration.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle as usual after the 1-0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo for the sake of simplicity, intervened and said; "We have to thank, coach!"
"That was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who had no resentment despite his renewed existence as a reservist.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best Schalker last season, knows that he did not actually get on the sidelines with his coach - but gets a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control."
It wasn't easy telling him that
"It was not easy to tell him that, I will tell you quite honestly," Tedesco reported from the moment he told Naldo that he was not in the starting team.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it 's always about the matter, it' s about the club, "Tedesco explained the step.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can take a breather at the moment.
And that we keep everyone in the boat, "Tedesco explained the rotation, which recently also caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving to be an exemplary team player on the bench.
The mood in Austria's industry continued its decline in August compared to the euro area.
The purchasing managers index (PMI) was at a 37-month low of 46.7 points.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third best mood in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the index is still below the 50-point mark indicating growth for the 13th month in a row.
Only Ireland's industry cracked that threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The Greeks were at the bottom (42.1 points).
In Germany, France, and Spain, the sentiment barometer fell, but more slowly than in previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March, at 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened decline could mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry remains the number one brake on growth, at least in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell at a rate not seen since November 2011.
The companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
In China, too, industrial production fell more sharply in August than initially thought.
The sentiment barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing managers index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are surveyed.
Tuchel's PSG team achieves eighth victory in the eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19: 45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel continues to rush from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won 3-0 (1-0) thanks to two goals from superstar Neymar and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar brought PSG into the lead after 22 minutes and made the final score in the aftermath.
Christopher Nkunku (46.) provided for the interim 2: 0.
Paris thus also succeeded in the dress rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the premier class, Tuchel's team had to accept the only compulsory game defeat so far this season at the 2-3 in Liverpool.
