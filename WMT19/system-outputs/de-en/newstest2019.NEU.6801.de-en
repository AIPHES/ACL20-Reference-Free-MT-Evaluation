In the afternoon another surprise awaits our candidates: they will not contest the romantic candlelight shoot in front of the MY SOLARIS alone, but at the side of Male-model Fabian!
Hvar - flirting, coquetting, seducing - no easy tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Schöne Münchnerin" candidates deliver during the shooting with People photographer Tuan and defy wind, gas and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shooting is available in the video:
DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on you getting into a conversation, that you also talk to him about why he seems to have felt one or the other in the way that is laid down in his statement," Grindel said on the football podcast "Phrasenmower" of the "Bild newspaper.
Despite months of debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed until a certain point that this would be the case, "Grindel said.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July, also justifying it by saying that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The head of the DFB repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with German coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build up pressure, but he knows it from football in such a way that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation hasn't come about so far."
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 2:13 p.m., the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was in arrears.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and fire debris had to be cleared to the absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had plugged a battery to the store at noon.
That could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, because the owner had many collector's items in his garden hut.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to take the children away from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has streamed live herself how she apparently wants to tear the children away from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see "Luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, Lohan can be seen getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family she wants to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of trafficking children.
She provides no evidence of all this in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan can be heard in the video as she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently, she is trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses a slap in the face.
In tears, the actress then asserts how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe started in Japan in December 2014.
It is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of deaths on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there is talk of at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla supervisory board chief
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletrocar maker.
The US stock market regulator sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO is withdrawing from the supervisory board, but he is allowed to remain CEO.
British Conservative Party Congress
Sharp guarded - the Tories "party congress
Birmingham is becoming the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name duplications for years.
Now they have reached an agreement.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on this this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("He doesn't") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before Brazil's presidential election, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate, ahead in the polls.
His fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" reprocessing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," development board member Peter Mertens told the industry journal "Automobilwoche."
The imprisoned and on leave Audi chief Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / gearbox combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in dealing with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was set up in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's parent Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organisational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and intends to continue discussing it this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of authorising the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust gas values after the exhaust gas scams were announced.
In doing so, he knew about the manipulation or deliberately ignored it.
Currently, Chief Sales Officer Bram Schot heads the company as acting CEO.
Due to the changeover to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production outages at Audi, Schot told the "Heilbronner Stimme."
In principle, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electric mobility.
There are already 15,000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to join DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup exit and the Özil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to run for the post of DFB President again next year.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as possible," Grindel said as a guest early on Sunday morning at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio."
You have to keep trying to get re-elected, I will do that.
And then you have to look at whether the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "want to work on the future project" after the contract for the 2024 European Football Championships.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 in place of Wolfgang Niersbach, who was toppled over the summer fairy tale affair.
In the fall of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote is due at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to work on the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will continue to advise in this role in the Bureau in the future and will of course be cordially invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that a national player without a migrant background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB in the future.
Currently, this office is held by Cacau, a native of Brazil, and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone with a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says," the issue is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Really take off with half-wise scales
I have been owning a new toy for four weeks.
A scales that measures not only my weight, but also the body fat content.
It can also display muscle and bone mass.
The thing also calculates the body mass index, but it's more for the stranglehold.
He doesn't say anything about whether I have replaced fat with muscles.
Basketball League: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the Basketball League with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up won easily with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing match over 40 minutes.
Newcomer Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 points), who was committed from Ludwigsburg, also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators on his mandatory game debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg pro Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 points.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP giant Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter in coach John Patrick's team with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg began the new season with a clear success.
With the Basketball Lions Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings surpassed the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Brunswick, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been a majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run by the Baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, among others, during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
The city centre of Cologne had been partially closed for the opening of the Ditib mosque.
Several thousand police officers were deployed - including snipers.
The Ditib Islamic Association is under criticism because it is considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, boos and horror seconds
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have campaigned for more commitment to the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Engage wherever you can," Mendes told around 60,000 spectators at the festival on Sunday night.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid agencies, also showed up on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a second of horror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was shots, got scared and tried to flee.
In short, panic arose, people ran confused.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organiser Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin then reassured people from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You are all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the internet, as every year.
If you wanted to get one, you had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there were cheers and applause from the audience - boos for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Together with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons on stage, he advocated more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke out in the US Senate Judiciary Committee in favour of the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge, pushing many women upside down.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who say they have experienced sexual assaults themselves, confronted him in an elevator on their way to the committee meeting.
"You can also meet me in an elevator at any time," Flake told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: Federal Government defends ejection of journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the ejection of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist, who lives in Hamburg, had covered a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the front row.
The T-shirt, was not the problem, Seibert told Bild on Sunday.
It was a matter of disturbing the course of the press conference.
The action of the journalist had created a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had therefore caused personal protectors to bring the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely irrespective of whether or not it is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: it was only at the beginning of September that the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but trials against the two are still ongoing in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht," produced by the NDR, is known for humid conversations at the counter of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten."
Presenter Ina Müller and her guest encounter some beer, some wine or even higher percentage drinks in order to loosen up the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory vocal inserts.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time there: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "Men's Hearts," "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Horny Day."
But the Munich man didn't get the trip to the far north well at all.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely contrite on it, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights he has now gained: "Rule one: NOT go to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And the round of egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half past three, also leaves.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the 43-year-old's face.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most purposeful - headache tablets.
Others simply amused themselves at the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
It is not yet known how Ina Müller survived the nightly scuffle.
But since she has been moderating the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to contend with vandalism and treason
The entry into the 36 kilometre long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and waste.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are scarcely emerging.
Shards, cigarette dumps, rubbish and rubbish, demolished trash bins and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with a seating group to the cycle path on the Haaße-Hill in Treysa has been presented for some time.
For the flagship object Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland, a more than unbelievable sight.
The topic has been occupying members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for some time, according to the cycling commissioner of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Board.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the laying of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the imperative of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the issue to the local council.
It is not only the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, the railings are also destroyed: posts are torn out of the earth, dustbins are demolished, signs are knocked over, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, ADFC member Susanne Klippert says.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the resting place on the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting place for Saufgelage.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly here on the Haaße-Hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "It may set the threshold much higher to grasp the common good.
However, this would require a police force to pass by in a timely manner.
Basically, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße-Hügel.
It had to be made more attractive.
One could be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our cycle path is very high quality compared to others in Germany, "said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa to be an extremely critical hazard site.
There is no turning lane on the Haaße-Hill.
In case of heavy traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between the flow of traffic on both sides, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
To offer "D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "Music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family coexistence with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations competed, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an Albachtener who has lived in Hiltrup for a long time, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not yet experienced this in other parts of the city.
What did the lyrics see themselves connected to?
In the places, the Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his beatable song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Time and again it was about experiencing coexistence in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short rebuilding breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
So it was learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
Franke knew from the sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has placed all sorts of things on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favourites of the jury, however, there was something special - so that others can also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: him with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children performed again for the final - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, simplicity of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The city district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She regarded the event as a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon to be very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a visual shield, in it four cards with keywords, which - the old trick with the red foil - can only be deciphered when you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the cards, for example, it reads from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Windows.
3. Dice.
4. Feast."
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
Because it is not the terms that should be guessed here, but codes.
Alternatively, one player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card on which perhaps "3.4.2." is written.
In "Decrypto," it is not the terms behind the secret foil that are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube," "feast" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team if possible does not; because that wins the game if he succeeds in cracking the code twice.
So the encrypter notes and reads aloud: "throwing" for the cubes, "lots" as a contrast to festival; here, of course, something like "party" would also be possible and "Prague" because he was careful at school and knows the window crash there.
That's how it goes round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but you can better rhyme them with every hint that the encrypter gives there.
So the rewrites should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanatory video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But anyone who has started will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre primus "Codenames," which also puts an agent ematics on a game of fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you are only interested in rates and not winning points, you can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harasses guests in pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate twice on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler greeting in the Upper City of a passing police strip, later he also noticed in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholic, he did not comply with the given reference to space by the police, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate in the detention cell.
In a sober state, he must then also be criminally responsible for the use of license plates of unconstitutional organisations.
Pressig plant was home to the Schubloks
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers bang on buffers, you heard it all over Pressig," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't excite anyone.
The brakes also squeaked and the carriages crawled.
That was just pure railways.
Statements that are emblematic of Dinkel's homeland.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railways.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which after an ascent of about 220 meters of altitude has its crossroads in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, train and drawer blocks used to be needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway company workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprenticeship workshop, driving line and railway mastery.
"The centrepiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a renovation in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and a professional railway worker for 47 years.
The Bahnbetriebswerk (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the side routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - NordHalf.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported on a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the route in 1939 already minimised the need for train and drawer blocks.
From 1977 onwards, they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weights were ranked a month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were demolished, and in 1991 the rest were demolished.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that a better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport, has not been envisaged."
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld."
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, the exit.
On 1 June 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig shunting station was history.
"The rangers and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Any misstep would have had fatal consequences.
Why the railway station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing, as Julia Görges did before.
Kerber won 6-2, 6-2 against Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic at the China Open.
The next opponent of the world rankings third is either Yulia Putinzewa of Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6-3, 4-2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian, ranked number 13, gave up.
The sister-in-law is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Pleasure," a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach at the weekend.
With great relief, organizers and visitors registered the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the Dahlmann- Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Around the Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Pleasure."
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great influx of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
A little surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his task in proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
In the past, both have already actively participated in the selection of artists and have helped design flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Art & Pleasure, there is again a 70-cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanz," designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high level of support of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framing.
Walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the "lucky tree" of the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau awaits the visitor on the right side.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully equipped with 20 wind turbines, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashed through the bushwork in the background, the object looks fairytale sunbathing and invites you to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental, who prefers to dedicate herself to the event in three-dimensional letters for 15 years of K&G.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child."
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy structure made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 nightmares: Singers celebrate 50th birthday festively
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the nightmares also gave air to their displeasure at the time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to resign themselves to the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia," there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbusch, they launched the MGV 68 nightmares.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated big in the "House of Encounter."
"It will be full today," Chairman Jürgen Holstiege guessed, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
It became an elegant ball, festive clothes had been asked before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Encounter," but comfortably at tables.
In between, movement was called for: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled on the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honour that the singers from the MGV 68 albums made the voice sound themselves.
Fittingly for the occasion, cheerful songs were called for.
Almost set: "Such a day, as beautiful as today."
In keeping with the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheim wine."
In allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hops."
Again, the choir direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time, was sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said: "He has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece he does." By the way, this time it wasn't just men who presented themselves singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.
After all, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a big raffle.
The proceeds will be used to finance a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatos Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd league women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber marches.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is really good in league three.
No trace of shyness or fracking sauces, the independents do their thing.
And that's really good at 3-0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we've already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied. "On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they get it to the finish line, such a game can tilt," Büring knows from years of experience.
After all, USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full yield to the finish.
"We are all aware of who is on the other side in such a derby.
That doesn't break our genius.
I saw really good volleyball in phases, "Annacker did not haggle with the 0-3 - and immediately went over to the agenda.
Where the journey will go for the independents does not seem foreseeable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one thing does he feel confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable to regional league volleyball. "They don't want to turn their gaze down into the fourth league anyway.
If the vest is not contaminated in the next few weeks, they will have to look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we will go to Emlichheim first.
Aasee will compete in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship," Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series may have been complicit in her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Heide Keller (76) made her role of chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went off board forever.
The series, which made her a star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That may also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world alone with a suitcase and many colleagues I admired perceived me on an equal footing, "Keller says in an interview with" Bild am Sonntag."
At first, she had always been only "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that had changed with the "dream ship."
For now, the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so well."
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time may have been quite envious, but "like many men, Hans was afraid of conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller had always tried to be "the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
In good German, this means that I have adjusted, "she continues.
She had always felt that she was "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, whom I never really was, even if I sometimes seemed cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After an already failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I sat howling in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why it never worked out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love far too naively."
The night folder, who regularly explores the night life of the city in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has ventured to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our wrinkle is not a moth, but a little light-hearted.
And the glaring splendour into which a green carpet has dipped on the six-seater square dazzles him excessively.
But it's just a film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So he torches across the square this late Thursday evening to briefly ease himself in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis."
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: the Need Centre on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks to the sky in the men's oasis for some reason.
So out here, over to the other side of the road: invited guests, who have just entertained the opening film "Green Book" at the best level in the cinema next door, celebrate the start of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store, as every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as you know, the works shown come from all over the world.
What do you not have to come up with in an article about this festival in order not to fall into surreptitious advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The wrinkle binds a ribbon around the feelers, which has put a good fairy on him, and two bulky doormen actually wave him in generously.
Inside, the invited crowd, they dance to live music well after midnight or are given rhythms by DJ to which they shout at each other, and rinse down exquisite appetizers with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters await sipping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut up, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is that all the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator."
If these are two separate instructions, he has squandered himself in the dressage code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly already saved lives.
In the upstairs household goods department, the poultry overturns a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye," matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been campaigning for said brand for years, is not here that evening.
But there, between local prominence, checkout table and kitchen items, a face that seems familiar to the observer moves past: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His leading actor is unlikely to be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, at almost sixty, almost acting like a choir boy, walks through the crowd.
He is not squeezed, not gifted, you are at most stealing.
It is precisely for this restraint, often misunderstood as clampdown, that international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Trainer and ex-football star Diego Maradona is pleased with his team's victory.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new homeland of Mexico.
After a 2-0 win by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia-Rythmen, as can be seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow-colored jersey, fired by the players.
The Mexican runner-up had defeated the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona shouted into a TV camera "Always with my guys, always."
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Association League 1: ASV Send "destroyed on the ground" after last-minute bankruptcy
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association list ASV Senden, could hardly grasp it: "Such a bitter defeat." His protégés were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
They had not played badly - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - over long phases, the broadcasters.
Only the initial phase "we totally slept," the ASV coach was annoyed.
The hosts quickly led 8-1, and the early break that Bieletzki had taken was not fruitful at first.
"But then suddenly a ruck went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the gap was only two goals.
Senden's best, Marius Hintze, in particular, hit once and for all in the phase.
After the change, things got even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalised at 15:15, then the relay changer led almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29:26).
And then?
Involve the impartial into the event.
Bieletzki is usually wary of looking for the guilt of others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff cashed in "was a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The guys fought great, also stood well against seven men at the back and repeatedly threw at the empty goal.
But they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come," said Bieletzki, who was fully served.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (Hof County), the police are looking for the woman's remains.
Volunteers dug up a road near Marxgrün on Saturday.
To this end, the road covering and several layers underneath it were removed, according to police and prosecutors.
According to new findings, the missing person may have been buried not far from their place of residence at the time.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
Investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police and the Public Prosecutor's Office have been working intensively on the case again, according to the data.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators encountered a abnormality under the road near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officers limited the site to a few metres.
The results of the excavations should be announced in the course of the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking on the net.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should use passphrases to secure their accounts on the network.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, and it does not harm to equip computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as head of the billionaire company.
He and the US stock market regulator SEC filed an out-of-court litigation over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla each pay $20 million, and Musk is also stepping down as chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German chairman of the supervisory board.
He may remain CEO, on the other hand.
In the settlement, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager in the US Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, who is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the lawsuit.
He had always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange, paying $420 per share, and the financing was secured.
That would have valued Tesla at a total of $72 billion.
Later, Musk rowed back: Tesla remains on the stock market.
Under the agreement, Tesla will now have to find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team 1-1 at Chelsea FC
Liverpool FC came to a 1-1 at Chelsea FC.
In the top game at Chelsea FC, the attacker, who has just been changed by coach Jürgen Klopp, provided the 1-1 (0:1) in the 89th minute.
After six wins at the start, Liverpool fell back to second place.
Chelsea remain third, and the new frontrunner is Manchester City.
Eden Hazard provided the Chelsea lead in the 25th minute with his sixth hit of the season.
After that, the Klopp team missed the equaliser several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger cleared on the line (31st) after a solo by Liverpool's goalkeeper Mohamed Salah.
Shortly before the end, Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a slump in the angle.
Record champions Manchester United are slipping deeper and deeper into crisis after the worst start to the season since 1989.
The team of controversial coach José Mourinho lost 1-3 (0:2) at West Ham United and remains only in the table midfield with ten points after seven days of play.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match against FC Valencia.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno came to his first Premier League assignment after an injury to Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League game at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won 2-0 against Brighton & Hove Albion by goals from Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Agüero (65th).
Leroy Sané prepared the 1-0, Ilkay Gündogan was not used by the new frontrunner.
"Let's Dance" juror Joachim Llambi and wife Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi has probably separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known through the RTL show "Let's Dance."
After 13 years of marriage Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhalcontent) reports on the separation of the well-known presenter and dance expert, citing Llambis's lawyer.
"Our clients separated amicably and amicably," the lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser said, according to "BamS."
The most important thing for the two now is the welfare of their two daughters.
According to the report, the couple met in a pizzeria in 2003 and married two years later.
Joachim Llambi comes from Duisburg and was a successful tournament dancer and stock broker.
Llambi became known on television for his juror work on the celebrity dance show "Let's Dance" on RTL, as well as for various appearances in quiz and entertainment broadcasts.
Arrests at demonstration in Barcelona
Barcelona - There were clashes with the police during demonstrations in Barcelona on Saturday.

Polls: 46 percent don't want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
After the squabbles of the past few weeks, the GroKo is cashing in several poll lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday trend for Bild am Sonntag.
In the weekly poll by the Opinion Research Institute, the AfD is up by one count to 17 percent, the SPD is giving up one point compared to the previous week and ends up at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only get to 27 percent.
This is the lowest level for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 percent and the FDP 10 percent.
If a federal election were held on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would together receive only 43 percent of the vote, according to Emnid.
As a result, the grand coalition has currently lost the majority on the Sunday question in all the major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently get 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 federal election, they received a combined 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the range is also large: the AfD, the second strongest party in several polls, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach 12.5 to 17 percent of the vote.
The left is on average 10 percent, and the FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3% upwards and downwards, depending on the share of the vote.
But popular support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens think that Merkel is the right person in the chancellor's office, according to the Emnid survey commissioned by BamS.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the grand coalition to hold until the next regular federal election in three years, while 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
Another poll published on Saturday also showed significant loss of popularity for Merkel.
The Germans are also divided on whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, while 44 percent are against.
As a result, 64 percent of Union supporters want a candidacy, and 35 percent do not.
Curtain at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - they should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket exudes almost an anachronistic romance as a place of acquaintance for great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short bargains at the cooling table or the favourite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swing to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being not so much a contact exchange, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We dared to test: how do women react, you don't talk about the hot porridge for long in the first message?
Here is the astonishing result.
It has regular Hollywood lovestory potential when the love happiness is preceded by an out-of-the-eye lost and refound plot.
If the guy also registers with his worshipper at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, it sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
For example, the author of this Annonce in an Aldi branch unknown to us is quite to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 per cent reduced organic turkey meat."
For believing in the magic of analogue acquaintance, she definitely deserved her happy ending à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgerischule has been participating in the action "Lids against polio - 500 lids for a life without polio."
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease, known in German as polio, leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, polioviruses, can only be contained by vaccination, as stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand calm for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about Mario Götze's form and fitness.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that's not good for us, "Reus, who is friends with Götze, told TV channel Sky after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No haste in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the football federation Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no haste in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We have not even talked about a treaty yet.
There is no fixed date when we will do that.
"But there will certainly be the moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl said on the TV channel Sky on Sunday night.
Football: District League: Researchers performance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went hard on the court with his own.
He gave himself a word, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (internally) to talk about the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it is running again around the Brandhoveweg.
The baptismal proof is the 1-1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, only skinny past the ascent last season.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
"We made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen, "Fetsch praised his guys and looked up each individual after the match to simply say" thank you "for so much opposition against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came for him - the 4-4-2 went almost seamlessly over to a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front line.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his exit (17th), the changed Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
That would almost have been the case when the SCA struck dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box twice in minute 41 in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his subject.
After the break, the VfL cheekily took full control.
Thewes from 18 metres narrowly failed.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes-entry.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch missed another fresh cell cure on the left side.
When Altenrhein's Chris Naberbäumer felled Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free-kick for the placeholders 18 metres in front of the guest housing.
The fouled competed himself and demonstrated his dangerousness by standards.
Westhues "thing with the right slip hit the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1-0 (71st).
20 minutes still, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty area unhappily to his hand in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79th).
Wolbeck had to survive anxious minutes in the final phase before Geske had the victory hit on the puck from 12 metres in the 87th minute.
Perhaps it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4-1 against Hanover 96
Starting position: Four points after five days of play - that could not be enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hanover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure the first home victory.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
During the landing, there was an accident at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
At around 2 p.m. on Sunday, there was a drama at the airfield in Kottingbrunn.
There was turbulence during the landing of a helicopter, as police confirm to oe24.
The Heli was captured by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a standstill on the side.
Immediately, police, rescue and fire brigade were informed.
The volunteers came to the scene of the accident with a large crowd.
The ÖAMTC emergency medical helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one material damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to go home independently.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of the investigation.
According to fire service spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire, but it could be quickly extinguished.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on company boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female as of the cut-off date of 1 September, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture," which will be officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was available to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to set themselves up differently, otherwise the international competitors will move past them," said Foundation Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the US, the UK, or Sweden, purely male leadership teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
In comparison, the gap makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It is a different corporate culture.
In addition, the slight increase in the proportion of women among the German stock exchange companies was solely due to positive impulses among the companies in the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
Although, according to Allbright data, only 6.8 percent of board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
At the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signalled that they would not continue to make a voluntary commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
A different picture emerges with the supervisory boards: as of 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"If as many women were recruited to the boards every year, a 40 percent share would have been reached as early as 2023," the report says.
Some even make a miracle: luxury bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari earns best.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros of operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble suppliers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros with each car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put a strong emphasis on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices of an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros of profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

The tourist association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session with a torch procession.
For the 60th time, the association is organising the wine festivals, which from now on rise every Saturday in October in the large banquet tent on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, those responsible moved through the town to the festival square under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn.
In the already prolific banquet tent, the chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. "To host something like this for 60 years - this is a madness achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that, "Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine princess Lisa II later symbolically arrived with the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many have found their way to us after Abtswind." Later, "The Troglauers" provided a mood.
On Sunday, when the Abtswinder church consecration was also celebrated, the association had set the drinks prices in the afternoon on the occasion of the anniversary as they were 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival will take place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before going into the second round a day later in the banquet tent.
In Bonn: Emergency medical car crashes into taxi
An emergency medical car is severely damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passer-by has been fatally injured in the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - preferably even save lives.
Such a rescue trip came to a fatal end for a 26-year-old in Bonn.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in the collision of an emergency medical car with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, according to police.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency medical car had crossed a red traffic light with blue light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then collided at an intersection with the taxi, which was driving at Green.
The doctor's car hurled against a traffic light mast and a tree after the collision.
He captured the passer-by, who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of emergency medical car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency medical car were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed by volunteers.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but she could no longer help the pedestrian.
Another emergency doctor called in tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police are investigating, in close coordination with the Bonn Public Prosecutor's Office, who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, it's uncomfortable for Mourinho
After the daunting exit in the league, Manchester United are now also losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, Manu is 1-3. The way the defeat is likely to be talked about.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute, in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic shot 3-1 for West Ham, just three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside in Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester's defenders stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of a previously inadequate performance for a long time.
The mood at United's city rival Manchester City is very different at the moment.
The Citizens, trained by Mourinho's big competitor Pep Guardiola, came to an unendangered 2-0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the outsider's defensive bar for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalscorer, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the leap to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer leader of the table
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the league, Xherdan Shaqiri won a 1-1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As with the Cup exit, Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man at the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came on the field for Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute, narrowly missed the equaliser after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his hat-trick.
So after the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea were not to be beaten for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and through the rematch in the league, the Blues plunged Liverpool from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 victories.
However, the Gunners' fans, with Granit Xhaka playing through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a report of success against the surprise team from County Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unhappily booked Alex Iwobi's entry into his own goal, and just two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third hit of the season.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to their fifth win in a row and are now just behind big rival Tottenham in fifth place. A strong impression continues to be left by climber Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained undefeated for the fifth time in a row at 2-0 against Southampton in the league and occupy 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Paris car salon marked by diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet ubiquitous: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits are unlikely to let go of the German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showing their innovations in the French capital from next week, together with competition from all over the world.
Diesel no longer plays a major role in this.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin by then, are still likely to be an important topic, at least behind the shiny scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core VW brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and, among other things, have their first pure electric models with them: the Ingolstädter e-tron is due to be launched at the end of the year, and the EQC of Stuttgart in 2019.
But both have already been officially presented.
BMW's iNext is not due to start until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3 Series.
A total of more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, more than a million visitors came.
At least 380 people were killed in the severe earthquakes and the subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second a magnitude of 7.4.
Communication and transport connections have been damaged, and enormous material damage has been caused.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke in over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims will still rise significantly.
So far, the figures have only come from Palu.
However, numerous other communities - along Sulawesi's west coast - are also affected.
About 150 bikers celebrate divine service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-cyclists.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at the Haus Nordhelle on the last Sunday of a month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to celebrate a far from ordinary service.
As of 10 o'clock, the cars had already lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker early shopping was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given during the biker service by the Rev. Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical accompaniment.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill strikes rather poetic-quiet tones," says the Rev. Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big festival: After the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his astonished spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the large funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how it would become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step of work this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which look a little like crockery, layer by layer on top of each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of the work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the foxes farmer also had already finished bottled specialities with him.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest feather white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in foxes peat" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents talked, while the children were not only able to follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built up bouncy castle for themselves.
Active members of the foxes "camaraderie of former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
The local club will also offer a day of action next year.
But then, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of events.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the issue: after all, it will go round the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season bankruptcy: "Shocked situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hanover 96 around him and gave them courage.
However, there was not much positive to see before at the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shameful situation, but you have to get out there as a team," said 96 football professional Pirmin Schwegler, pushing back: "That's disappointing, of course, because you always take a lot of action."
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) hit, are at the bottom with two points and are a candidate for descent in their current constitution.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated its first home victory of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who advanced to the midfield of the table with seven points after the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League game against Lazio Rome.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action by Hesse on his starting debut and never got a grip on Hanover's defence.
The striker, who has long been battered after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was borrowed from Liverpool FC, was also in the initial formation of the Frankfurt players for the first time, which began vividly.
A header ball from Lucas Torró (17th) falsified on the goal net brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defence around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back), who had failed at short notice.
The leadership for the landlords was almost inevitable and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a deflected corner, Haller extended his head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the defender, who came from French runner-up AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt dropped before the break.
This time, Haller matched his Storm partner Rebic, who skillfully tanked through and left 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser with no chance.
At half-time, Hanover coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak performance of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony now played a little more courageous forward, but inflammatory ideas remained missing until just before the end, when the connection hit was still successful.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After less than an hour, Rebic started a solo and then put across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only showmanship for the Frankfurt against overstretched guests, and Jovic also hit a minute before the end.
Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter, made it to the audience of millions at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two strokes.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on 14 September or the Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shot Christ, who dates from the Thirty Years' War and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier, according to legend.
Blood then flowed from the gunshot wound.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is still not finished, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, the Rev. Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
Despite the importance for the Geisinger parish, the divine service was poorly attended.
After the divine service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the ecclesiastical part of the Festival of the Cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting you to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish home.
The choir members provided the visitors with savoury food as well as a large selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farmhouse.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the city church. Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, the sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will drag on until next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more specifically.
What is certain is that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but more has also been found, which was only made possible by the appearance of scaffolding.
The pedestal plaster work has been completed, the natural stone work is to be started before the winter and it is hoped that more than half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that "a very special house" is now being handed over to its destination in Münsterblickstraße - all those present agreed at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the dormitory of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officer building of the US Army was put to the test for the residents with a mobile phone cap: "The house had come into the years and was no longer up-to-date in the equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved on to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life Aid Donau-Iller opens new home
The life aid invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, and the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in time and financially.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which allowed the residents to experience the freedom to move even without foreign help.
The head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, Gertrud Kreutmayer, also expressed a similar view: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile."
The cosiness and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
He added: "The property in this situation is a real stroke of luck because it can no longer be purchased in today's situation."
In total, the new dormitory in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1500 square metres, which are divided into three residential groups.
Life Aid Managing Director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time workers, all of whom are employed by tariff.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before Unity Day, the deputy leader of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to all compatriots not to resign themselves to the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences, "the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania told" Tagesspiegel am Sonntag."
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than the people of West Germany, but would receive 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Is this putty dog ending the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean pang hunting dogs a gift.
As Moore's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, who are about a year old, reached their recipient on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to "make it easier for the animals to get used to."
The dogs with the thick white coat, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to compete together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
As part of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile propulsion.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this year of remembrance for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "Picture Book" of Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to in-kind work - that is the unofficial motto for the Grand Coalition's working week, which begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, the SPD and also from the CSU have not recently mantra the "return to substantive work."
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and otherwise working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and in-kind work, but be it.
If the Federal Government is now ready to rededicate itself to its mission - governance - it should not be prevented from doing so now with conceptual debates.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and lamentations of the last few weeks may be shown as early as Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the ruling parties will meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early on; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, with the diesel retrofits and the Skills Immigration Act, conflicting issues are again on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange premiums, while the SPD and CDU see manufacturers as having a duty to retrofit older diesels.
While a rapprochement has emerged in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart on the planned skilled immigration law.
The SPD is calling for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be controversy among the coalition partners again - and how should it be otherwise?
It is not immediately and immediately that GroKo has joined forces, but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without controversy, a society characterised by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests will not move forward.
In order to be constructive, however, dispute must not be rebuilt for party tactical reasons on the question of being or not being.
This is still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD are supposed to argue - but always keep an eye on the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and beneficial to many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and the track change question can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regained confidence.
Above all, that is what the People's Parties must now fight for.
Mushroom checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister targeted
Does the Minister for Labour, of all places, violate the applicable law of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night," her legions had been working on social security reform, an exuberant social minister reported at the presentation of her own two weeks ago.
In the case of Liste-Mushroom Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is met with surprise - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via question.
She assumes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the use of her team and in no way wanted to announce violations of current service law in front of running cameras."
Still, she now has questions to be able to "acquit Har ­ tinger of any suspicion."
Police tear up a street in search of woman's body
Marxgrün - For a long time, the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, excavations have been carried out on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is still closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was preceded by the fact that investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with its guide, was finally able to limit the relevant place to a few metres in repeated use.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the supreme Bavarian monument protection authority, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said piece of road.
Prosecutors and criminal police have been working on the missing person case for more than a year.
Time and again, a cycle path was closed at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices because investigators suspect that Heike's body may have been buried here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But there are riots before that.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and the police took place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence supporters with paint powder, among other things, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to use a rally to honour their colleagues who were deployed in the polling stations last year in the referendum, which was classified as illegal.
Violence had also taken place at the time in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the 6,000 or so separatists then forcibly tried to break through the police chain, throwing the officers with paint bags and eggs, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, it said, citing the authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region from Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also departed abroad.
Several ministers from the then regional government and other activists from the separatist movement, on the other hand, remain in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the "right to self-determination" of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected helplessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate scoreless
Red and white Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
Even at FC Gütersloh, it was only enough for a 0-0 draw.
The final light and the third last turned out to be a gathered helplessness in front of 438 spectators at the Heidewaldstadion.
The first half was badly manageable by the entertainment factor.
If you therefore preferred to get a beer or a sausage, you could do so undisturbed.
There was no danger of missing a goal chance, because there was virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Gütersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire match in the 28th minute.
The Ahleners had the best - and in principle only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area boundary.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, and Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel aimed just over the housing from 18 metres and after an hour the Gütersloher also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball top by Matthäus Wieckowicz, it went fixed.
Nick Flock (62nd) "crowned" the swiftly presented counter over Sinan Aygün with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also dropped with a header ball from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It worked - nothing.
The Ahleners did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it didn't bring in anything either.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive: "I like the fact that we played to zero." But unfortunately the zero was also in front.
"We weren't as goalscoring this time as we were against Holzwickede and that's despite the fact that our opponent had no desire to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, everything "plummeted a bit" against a team "that just wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel that we could get an opponent, "Daut said.
To his sorrow, however, as a spectator, you didn't feel as if his team could score a goal.
The idea was too meagre for that.
Reckenfeld harvest market: Luckily there are enough creams
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld Table Issuing Office, for which these donations are intended, are pleased about this.
The volunteers assure: "These donations will also remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, while the place was still a little empty, but that should change over the course of the day.
Because: "It's so beautifully sociable here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus greeted the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent pinch of humour.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed up against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough creatures.
And the "replacement" could not be taken away from entertaining the more and more visitors musically in between.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung along at a late hour.
"Just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many active people with their booths, including mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should not be anything like a plaque at all," he thanked him for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all those who were in action at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful paint - here something goes.
Then the Maikwreath was taken down by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarter.
At many booths, work was done for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty, everything was to be had.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his decorative saw.
He had veneers, beer lids with Reckenfeld motifs and a lot more on offer.
Three Reckenfeld beekeepers offered a specialty: "Reckenfelder Honey," brought with them by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter still has a specialty.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to access it again and again, so the cake tasted so good.
It is the socialising that made the visitors stay long into the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubricants with local political message: No successful advertising for skate facility
In Lengerich, unknown people have campaigned in a hardly conducive way for the construction of a skate facility.
There are corresponding lubricants in several places, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of WN.
In at least one case, a criminal complaint has been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" are displayed on signs at the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt bistro had already been discovered after the professional election fair on 19 September.
Since the short message had apparently been left "only" with an edding at the time, it could have been removed without any problems.
"A few days later, however, it was back, this time sprayed up," Rottmann said.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
This case in particular gets a special touch by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the table.
If the skate facility is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.
It is quite possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate facilities.
After the old one at the LWL clinic had been dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The Council finally voted by a majority in favour of the fire station car park.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against building at this point.
A U-turn followed at the end of June.
The members of the main and finance committee now voted unanimously in favour of the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says on the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word will then be given to the city council.
He expects a decision this year, so a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Air traffic control bottleneck gets even worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of an improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control union, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known shortage of staff at European air traffic control systems, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," the trade unionist said.
Across Europe, the market for ready-trained pilots has been swept empty.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticised the fact that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the federal government, the states, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic city on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work condensation and overtime, this will not be possible without us," said the head of the GdF, which has many members at the federal German Air Traffic Control.
Maas again blamed the EU Commission for the pilot misery.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period, which runs until 2019, were far too low.
The resulting cost requirements and personnel savings in national air traffic control systems are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut off the air even further" for air traffic controllers.
At present, the EU requirements would be agreed by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is subject to constant lobbying pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high cost of delay for airlines will usher in a rethink.
The GdF will only participate in the improvement of the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," Maas said.
The previously announced admission of 120 pilot students per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary personnel build-up is not yet associated with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes in favour of Group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim chief executive Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at Sunday's meeting, the crisis-ridden group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are to be headquartered in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff cuts beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two resignations, the supervisory body counts only eight heads on the capital side.
This is contrasted with ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50 percent stake from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence at demos of police officers and Catalan independence supporters.
In two simultaneous demonstrations in Barcelona by Spanish police officers and Catalan independence supporters, there have been violent clashes with many injured.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 pro-independence demonstrators.
The Catalan police had tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a large crowd.
According to the forces, however, independence supporters repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier.
They had attacked the officers with paint and throwing shots.
According to the data, there were also riots between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
Police said there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police had wanted to pay tribute to colleagues who had taken action against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government, almost exactly a year ago.
At the same time, they called for better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez asked AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drowned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona, because it is a large European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Breakdown allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A security vulnerability in a mobile phone app has led to the personal data of ministers and MPs from the British Conservative Tory Party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the breakdown became known a day before the Tory party congress in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hanover police report a serious traffic accident on the federal road 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people were killed when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently in flames.
The volunteers are on the ground.

Football: Juve coach praises after top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game together with the half hour of Valencia that evening," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champion's 3-1 (1:1) victory against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive star was the decisive man in the important match against the pursuer even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and does it well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game after the early gap by the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung off the worst pursuer for the time being.
The goalkeeper picked up by Real Madrid first put on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26th / 49th).
And Ronaldo also did the preparatory work after a corner by header ball to hit head of defence Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who only had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," the coach praised.
But Allegri, of course, also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We have to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
The best Juve goalscorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus "supremacy seems to be becoming even more crushing.
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. With 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has a six-point lead over Naples.
The spreadsheet trained by former Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti was not unchangeable against Turin.
But at the latest after the reference to the place of the already warned Mario Rui (58th), the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to leave the court with yellow-red after getting too hard against Paulo Dybala.
"We played well against a good Napoli," the Turin coach commented.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German national player has prevailed at Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool FC, was in action in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the court in the Turin 2-0 win and is locked for Tuesday's home game against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly bizarre appearance, rapper Kanye West attracted attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" at the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused headaches and question marks among the spectators.
The 41-year-old also announced a name change in time for the release of his new album.
From then on, he may only be called "Ye," according to the musician.
"The being that used to be known as Kanye West," he tweeted, referring to the late singer Prince, when he took his stage name.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
Already the tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think" Ye "is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means" you, "" the rapper said.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Created!
Hoetmar's coach, Averhage, made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was just more handy, we almost never faced him with problems. "The list of Hoetmar shooting possibilities reads correspondingly thin.
Grade two scoring chances in 90 minutes, so it is rarely possible to make games positive.
Football county league A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two opportunities in the first round, but Maik Krause took advantage of the first from a sharp angle for the early lead (7th).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have increased Uphus, but after great preparatory work from Krause he squandered free standing.
The hosts only had a double opportunity when Moritz Höne initially failed to goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and in the aftermath Jan Blome also found his champion in the Sendenhorster keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all awarded.
Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use a trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - for the guests (75th).
It was only when Nils Berheide stabbed the ball over the line that the game was decided (81st).
"We had criticised each other hard before, which was different today than in the last few weeks," was Florian Kraus's conclusion.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7th), 0:2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75th / Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in nightmares: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think of it," he said.
"We didn't get access to them at all." With them, he presumably meant the wing-pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-whites who stood out with a collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty win," he said, winking cheekily and pulling from his players, on the other hand, the relief was to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Remember, after a duel between two teams, one of which, namely nightmares, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for class preservation.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes that were behind him.
"That was by far our best performance of the season," he says.
"How we come back after the 0-2, how we keep against one of the top teams in the league throughout the season, that was really phenomenal."
This makes it all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top goalkeeper Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th hit of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for that goal.
He set up the 2-0 over the left side for Fabian Fröhning (39th).
We knew that, but you just can't take such a player out completely.
"That was madness what he did," Lewandowski enviably acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the change of side, his own eleven managed to equalise: McGill's free-kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long Toreck (45th).
After the change of side, it was McGill again who scored the equaliser (59th).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked nightmares again (64th), just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalised (69th).
Despite the abundance, Albersloh failed to counter the last Concordia hit (80th) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mills - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Goals: 1-0 Zymner (24th), 2-0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow and red: Atalan (74th / nightmares).
Football: TSV Straßberg fights point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually travelled for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0-0.
Media: The entire Bureau of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire Bureau of football runner-up Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
In the evening, several media unanimously invoked a joint letter from the panel of the Saxons.
At first, there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal is said to be internal infighting with the former Bundesliga player.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
It's good that he's gone again.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many had said that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he wants to pick up the tolerance prize in person in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
This is how academy director Udo Hahn calculated him when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellor were already with us." However, the fact that celebrities keep appearing at the academy in Tutzing Castle was also an issue during the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective. On 29 September, the writer Frido Mann will be at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: he wants to personally receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which television presenter Dunja Hayali also receives in another category (we reported).
The 80 or so meetings until mid-2019 have it in them.
"The pension is just not safe!" is written in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting on Syria:" Barbarism without limit."
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - war mocks every humane idea."
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change in work through digitisation.
Academy director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the founding of the European Union,
Karl Marx's birthday soon awaits some more visitors to the direction of critique of capitalism, others more of a tendency "from the far left to the center."
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner imagined gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes also comes to words until the end of the sentence, and on the other hand a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies so congenially harmoniously that some may have wanted a solo.
This was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, namely as it fit the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates something of its own: what would have emerged from Mozart's composing if "the Nannerl" had opened the door unexpectedly?
So Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt full of blood and wounds" to the "Song of Death," and from Mozart's minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, presented flowers to the chansonette.
But the chairman, Heidemarie Markenbeck, could not take an additional thank you.
She had the idea of giving the duo one in Wolbeck in addition to appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.
Key words of the article "Gender understanding with heart"
The controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk may remain CEO of electric car maker Tesla, but must resign as chairman of the board of directors.
Musk also agreed with the US stock market regulator SEC to pay a double-digit million fine, according to the SEC.
The background is Musk's surprising announcement in August that he would take Tesla off the stock market.
In its lawsuit, the SEC accused Musk of providing false and misleading information.
Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have slightly revised down the number of victims.
10 passengers were slightly injured instead of 15.
All have now been released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had remained in hospital for one night for observation.
He will be released later in the day, a police spokesman said.
The cause of the accident of the long-distance bus near Bruchsal is still unclear.
The long-distance bus had crashed head-on against a control panel unchecked on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women's national league: Ahlener SG narrowly retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlenerinnen had problems, especially with the third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who marked ten hits alone.
"Actually, I was well satisfied with the defence, only one player made too many goals.
We didn't get to grips with them, "said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many exuberant chances.
The concentration in the end left his team missing this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end behind a gap, was behind at the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45th).
It was only towards the end that the wider bench of the hosts became decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu put backroom Merle Klement on the left, who then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd league women: top performance of BSV Ostbevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
In the second league descent VC Allbau Essen, the blue-whites won 3-1.
"This was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked out that, "coach Dominik Münch said after an almost impeccable performance by his team at the toppled leader of the table.
The guests dominated the first round almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the runner-up of the previous year with 25:15.
Essen has accepted in the two-bar, but has not come into play.
We have dealt with them well.
Our opponent struck at high risk, but also produced a number of tickets.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen has switched the assumption to three bars.
We couldn't keep the impact pressure.
Food sucked up, and we let ourselves be lulled in a bit, "Münch continued.
At 18:17, the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had their nose in front for the first time.
Although Ostbevern defended four set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found his goal.
"The game was now a class better," the practice manager said of the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly with their surcharges to the BSV turning the leaf from 14:16 to 25:21 in the third section.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly."
Over 7:3 and 15:13, the blue-and-white passage brought four to their side with 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the large Ditib mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of shards in German-Turkish relations, which can only be painstakingly returned together," said Gökay Sofuoglu, chairman of the TGD, to the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of emphasizing the affiliation of Muslims to Germany side by side with German leaders, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The far-reaching exclusion of the German public has "reinforced many reservations."
Homeland club Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break, Folktreff-Zeit is finally back.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the local association Nottuln is already organising its fifth Nottuln folk meeting in the fireplace room of the Old Amtmannei.
Almost exactly to the day, it was a year ago that we held a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln, "says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk meeting would take place so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether it's Stormtief Friederike in January or heatwave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"As always, the program at the next Folktreff is a colorful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old percussionists," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites friendly musicians to Nottuln.
For the first folk hit "birthday," Klaus Spellmeyer has promised with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling," a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with plate-German lyrics.
Now he is on the road with an Irish folk band.
The creators of the Folktreff are happy to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten enthused the audience with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" and sent home with an earworm.
"We expect many cheerful guests to spend a sociable and humorous evening once again," the invitation from the local association says.
If you play an instrument and want to get actively involved, you are invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always occupied quickly, it is recommended to be there early enough.
The folk meeting starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China clears proposed merger between Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on their way to becoming the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
As a result, the multibillion-dollar merger still faces permits in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the US.
Most recently, according to an insider, the chances of approval there had improved because Linde has promised to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On 29 September 1893, the last founding impulses for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, he was called differently at the time: as the "District Sobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land," he was baptized by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit growing association was also different from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit growing, no one thought about flowers and horticulture at the time.
"At that time, in the epoch of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said county home nurse Günter Dippold in his keynote speech.
Fruit trees were supposed to line highways, and so-called industrial gardens were created in schools.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7,000 members.
But that is far from exhausting the spectrum.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village embellishment and nutrition play just as important a role as conveying knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwerfen" showed entertainingly on stage how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said the district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with smartphones & the like.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Councillor Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand is decided by the county association," added Councillor Söllner, highlighting the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The county association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county also left no doubt about this, county managing director and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the county association with a picture lecture and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was dosed.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the farm garden had turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature persists, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," pleaded the expert for fruit and walnut trees.
That is why there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian State Association.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe that to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower glasses of the music association Thurnau.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada's foreign minister postpones UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: they are giving both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister is now giving the trade agreement an absolute priority - and postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will not speak to the United Nations General Assembly until Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, it is focusing on renegotiating Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that negotiators from Canada and the US would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the US.
The US and Mexico agreed in August on a recast of the regional free trade agreement Nafta.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Discussions on a new edition have been going on for more than a year.
They are now due to be finalised by Sunday evening (local time), and Trump's administration wants to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
According to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo," the far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives.
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician was attacked on the open street at the beginning of September during a campaign event in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
On social networks, too, the associations mobilized against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynistic statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mingled with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As an ex-mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been mixing in politics for a long time, but has recently presented himself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieves an absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be a runoff on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from it successfully - no matter who he is running against.
Bolsonaro is known for inciting hatred against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Time and again, he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time, he said that the supporters of Lula's left-wing Workers' Party should be shot.
Europe regains Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale at the gates of Paris.
The outsider team of captain Thomas Björn dethroned the favoured defending champion USA for a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators on the three days at Le Golf National with great blows and outstanding team spirit.
After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
On the deathbed, Larsen had been surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
In a statement on Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in all hearts."
The head of the government also recalled that the monarch's opponent Larsen had appeared in 2010 at the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: Volume at compressed air chamber level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a rewrite of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure Hardrock by three bands friends with each other.
After the soundcheck and just before the concert begins, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly inspire the approximately 120 visitors to the "Mint Mosquito" rock night visibly.
Even the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the performance will be danced to the coherent and impressive interplay of the band.
Although "Encore" calls cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand."
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that Hardrock is not the same as Hardrock with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers," "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
It is not only the longing, almost balladry "Take Me Home" that impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-laden rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, however, has gained a special reputation since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents in cooperation with the band on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
Meanwhile, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo to the sound that feels even higher than before, running through the audience.
A certain volume is of course part of this kind of hard rock concert due to genre: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixing desk team, the three-way concert of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is at compressed air chamber level, for example, but is still well below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval," to which "The Ignition" refers on its website.
However, the Ahlener audience does not need deafening 120 decibels in jet drive strength, as is customary at the annual metal pitch in the north of the republic, on this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the tougher, rocking gear have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone saw and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say, but in a figurative sense, at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in glider accident at Essen / Mülheim airport
There has been a fatal accident at Mülheim / Essen airport.
A glider crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim / Essen airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim / Essen airport on Sunday.
As reported by the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung," a glider had crashed on the exhibition square at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, the flight student was on board alone - the plane is said to be a one-seater.
The plane had already been on landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is only a short distance from a festival tent on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
The airport Mülheim / Essen is located at the city border of the two Ruhr region cities and directly at the driveway to motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park & ride offer at major events at the Essen trade fair or the Gruga-Halle in Essen.
Trump slams Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that US President North Korea's ruler, Kim, is well disposed despite the nuclear crisis.
Now, however, Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has committed himself to a new flame.
The tragic thing is that it's a long-distance relationship.
In public on Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old sprouts of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, even though he is proving to be a rather tough chunk in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, he was tough, and it went back and forth between us," Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And it was not just the talks with Kim that would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump pointed to the halt of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service behind it.
The US president seemed well aware that the affection for the "Rocket Man," notorious for his martial threats - Trump's nickname for Kim - is not likely to be monstrous to everyone.
In any case, he immediately anticipated the expected criticism of it during his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But he cares very little, Trump said, then directed his index finger at the crowd: "I've always told you it's so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this crowded arena, but we would only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, atmospheric and on top of that pampered with sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city centre cleaned itself out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest not only took place in the banquet tent at the fire station tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to point out their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya, allowing them to be rescued.
The group filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July at risk of life and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," one man said in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers," whose editors alerted the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably could not have returned to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya while trying to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video, he said he put himself in danger of life.
One of his comrades was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the prison conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM is organising the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their homes this year with the help of the program, said Jorge Galindo, an IOM spokesman in the West African country.
The case of the Nigerians who have now been rescued is not extraordinary in view of the poor prison conditions in Libya.
However, he has not yet heard of a call for help via mobile phone video.
International organisations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At around 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the front house of the first floor, she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police, who have opened the investigation.
It is not yet possible to say whether things or money have been stolen.
Description of the perpetrator: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark trousers, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the Obernberg am Inn Police Inspectorate, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to stay in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in central Franconia after he stuck the car away from all forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers accidentally discovered the car not far from a pasture on Saturday afternoon and freed the missing person since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
According to the data, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he did not return from a ride with his off-road car over the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive searches, the man's whereabouts had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has said he has called for the rule of law in Turkey in a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This applies above all to waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this."
Laschet said he also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He had formulated the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved at short notice to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's readiness to fly at Cologne airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan continued to travel to the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact persons - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump does not tire of emphasizing the successes of North Korea's denuclearization negotiations, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for Washington to respond.
At the UN general debate, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The recent stalemate comes from the fact that the US is relying on coercive measures that are lethal to confidence-building," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
The fact that punitive measures could "force North Korea to its knees" is "a dream of people who don't know us."
In order to build confidence, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri stressed.
However, there have been no "appropriate reactions" from the US side to this, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council adopted sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
US President Donald Trump and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, have been pushing for strict compliance with the punitive measures at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea's ruler Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is due to travel to Pyongyang again for talks to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting did not get the many visitors to the House of the Open Door HoT any of this: white blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the harvest thank-you service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: a power outage had put the huge, two-part fridge out of service, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from scratch: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it on their own," Westbuer said.
And so everyone grabbed it.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Chefs can't do better," praised one visitor impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," emphasized the Rev. Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen caused astonishment with card tricks and other pieces of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW State Board of the Tafel
Out of frustration with criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essen Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has resigned from his post in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen Tafel had introduced a ban on admission for foreigners.
He resigned as vice-president of the NRW panels in July, Sartor told "Welt am Sonntag."
Too many have fallen in my back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding for the decision of his long-time deputy to dpa.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his step - there were people who didn't know exactly why the Essen table was doing this."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes," Weilerswist said.
In the "Welt am Sonntag," Sartor again criticized colleagues from other panels.
One should not take the approach, "without us, the people of the city are starving."
It was the task of the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essen man did not take part in a congress of the panels on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm told too much sweet shame," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis who criticised me so much at the time.
SF Lorch lose 2-0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, District League Lorch loses 2-3 against newcomers - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after backlog - Bettringen clearly beats Lauchheim.
With 2-0, Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV newcomer - in the end it was 2-3 and the disappointment among the sports fans was great.
The TV Heuchlingen is very different: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1, but won after 90 minutes with 2:1. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to win with a 3-0
Gladbach loses two-time lead - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2-2, the foals lose a lead twice.
Schalke come to their first victory of the season against Mainz (1-0).
(sda) Schalke have maneuvered to the sidelines four times in the first five league games with early opponents.
Now Domenico Tedesco's team once again showed the strength with which it took first place behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home quipe in the eleventh minute after strong preparatory work by Yevgeny Konopljanka, and as a result the hosts conserved the mini-cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund are once again greeting from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had entered a 0-2 gap against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came to a 4-2 victory in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalised with a double within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided the crowning conclusion of the increase in performance after the break with another double in the final phase (86th / 94th).
The VfB Stuttgart also came to the first victory.
In the meantime, the Stuttgart players had to fear Werder Bremen, who was decimated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler produced a curious one-throw own-goal that helped the guests equalise in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to its first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher, who competed with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave a lead twice, ultimately played 2-2 and have been waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's equaliser to 1-1 with his second Bundesligator.
In the flat shot from 20 metres of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, as was the second opponent after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa is increasingly proving to be a goalgetter in the storm of foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase from the OGC Nice hit for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh mandatory game.
After seven laps, Gladbach takes 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously undefeated Werder Bremen maneuvered into an uncomfortable situation against the VfB Stuttgart.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt's team was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first hit of the season, and after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: the 23-year-old Serb cashed in yellow and red after a jersey attack against Daniel Didavi.
Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Brewers back into the game with a curious one-throw own-goal (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgart players, who were acting in abundance, back on the winning road.
Nuremberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3-0.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens put the home team on track by foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state name
In Macedonia today, around 1.8 million citizens are voting on whether to change the name of their country in North Macedonia.
A "yes" vote could resolve the nearly three-decade simmering conflict with neighbour Greece.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any rapprochement of Macedonia with the West.
Voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member if the referendum outcome was positive.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three retirees and seriously injured them in some cases.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted in the Fluchtgasse in Alsergrund at around 10pm on Friday.
When the police arrived, they approached the accused, who went off with concentrated fists on passers-by and tried to attack them, about his behaviour.
The Syrian then tried to beat the officers and step down.
A little later, it turned out that the suspect had beaten three older ladies (65, 67, 75) to the ground with his fists at a tram stop in Währinger Straße shortly before.
He had also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the retirees were seriously injured.
They suffered hematoma, bruises and brain shakes.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for an unknown cause," according to police.
He was taken to hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the yes word in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership was not eligible for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, it's right." He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir with a rage speech on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the issue.
"This was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the right of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Citizens' Association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprosy.
Around 400 metres of hedge around the gardens of the residents of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for around twelve supporters.
"We are doing this in order to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, chairman of the Citizens' Association.
And so much has accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but luckily it is now only a form cut.
Because already in the spring, the hedge had already been shelled.
The breakfast, which always follows the work, also has a long tradition.
"Everyone should stay with forces," Walter Schröer said.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner takes gold at the Canoe Slalom World Championships
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Canoe Slalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, I had enough rides here on the facility and everything was right today, "said the London 2012 Olympic third.
In the finish, he threw his paddle away with joy and raised both arms victorious - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had start number four.
But the six remaining starters could not topple his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was Czech Jiri Prskavec ahead of Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempt at burglary this autumn into a detached house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to take advantage of that again.
Yesterday, the Gauting Police Inspectorate reported the first burglary attempt of this autumn.
The fact that it remained at the detached house on Königswieser Straße during the attempt is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators put their hands on just before 8pm on Friday.
The burglars guessed that the residents were not at home.
However, the alarm system apparently surprised her so much that she took the flight without prey.
Notes to PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Bust at Hertha: Reality caught up: Bayern challenged against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: FC Bayern "does not want to let the defeat in Berlin fall."
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate fazit for Niko Kovac's tenure.
The first small performance delle under the new coach Niko Kovac is not expected to increase to a bigger autumn low for the Munich players.
"A week ago we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now reality has caught up with us a bit, "said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that's why we are giving gas towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year out, no goal of their own was scored, as at the same time of the pre-season two mandatory games in series without a win, the lead in the Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund for the time being.
The overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at 1-1 with its running intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle bites over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the recently overpowering Bayern are to be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, however, he dealt surprisingly gently with his losers in his native city and pushed his first defeat as Munich coach only to the again poor handling of chances.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim fazit of his term of office positive before the national game break - otherwise the tone is likely to worsen.
For example, Kovac did not take extraordinary measures before this season's second premiership appearance after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax begins as planned, which had also defeated AEK Athens 3-0 at the start.
"Now it caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich, in particular, spoke plainly.
The right-hander appeared in the role as a reminder.
"I don't think this is all bad luck, we have to work it out again because we don't make the multitude of chances and make the mistakes at the back," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the last season, Bayern were even five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken over the top again with a one-point lead.
And so Kimmich, with a wink, rated at least positively that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavarians has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," the national player said.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
A new post is now to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in the permanent contentious issue of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticised the handling of the ex-world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the head of the DFB defended the association line.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally sharply attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the Causa at the ZDF "Sportstudio" in Mainz.
"In the future - because we also have a lot of players with a migrant background in the U teams - we have to draw very close conclusions that something like this will not happen again," said the 57-year-old, who wants to win a national player without a migrant background as another integration commissioner.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had sharply denounced racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil, who was born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England, "Erdogan said in the cathedral city on Saturday.
Honestly, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "sensibly treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would face players in the future.
The fact that someone says: if I win, I am German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that is not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I have always said that.
But he does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a result, an additional integration commissioner is now to be appointed alongside the Brazilian native Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone with no migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says," The issue is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup exit and the Özil affair, he wants to run for the post of DFB president again next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
Year old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg / Rödental - As reported by police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no exchange of personnel, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had left the road and driven against a control post.
Referring to this, the man did not want police on the ground and then drove away.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has proceeded in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and rammed a construction vehicle while turning.
Finally, the police were able to find and stop him.
His car had significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could no longer remember much.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorfire in Meppen: Almost 1000 volunteers are still in action.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 volunteers are still busy with the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop stable, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of volunteers is planned, it says.
On Sunday night, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster, which was declared just over a week earlier on 21 September, was lifted because it had been feared that the flames were endangering adjacent forests and settlements due to wind and sparks.
Thursday, it said that the fire was no longer threatening to spread to adjacent communities.
At times, more than 1,500 volunteers on the ground tried to get the major fire under control.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "tornadoes" are also planned for 2 and 5 October.
The fire was triggered by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the moorfire had at times moved up to a hundred kilometres far over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr intends to set up a contact point to receive damage reports.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday house owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly a year after the marriage for all came into force, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the yes word in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership was not eligible for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
If we get married, it's right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir with a rage speech on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the issue.
"This was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the right of adoption.
Referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is what neighbour Greece insists on because of its northern province of the same name.
As a means of exerting pressure, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote "yes," they will also give the starting signal for their country's western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from oblivion
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the US in 2016 and leaves behind a work that preserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on relatives in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be taken only with explicit consent, emphasises Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on relatives in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be taken - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, emphasises Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases, a card is found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the deceased's wish.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very stressful," Always said.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as Marita Völker-Albert, spokeswoman for the Federal Centre for Health Education, says.
"There is no register in which people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation -" she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or relatives disagree.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head chasing
Tomohiro Iseda, a 14-year-old student from Japan, is a world champion in head chasing.
He prevailed against 39 comrades in Wolfsburg at the weekend.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16 year old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old retiree from France, as Chief Arbitrator Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon in which participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was already present in Bielefeld two years ago as a then 14-year-old.
Organizer Laue can do little with terms such as superbrain, genius or prodigy.
"Head-scratching can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced a number of hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even computing competitions organised in stadiums.
One of the disciplines, for example, is the square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
When it comes to versatility calculation, the candidates get surprise tasks, for which they have to find a solution strategy quickly.
The Germans also have good chances here, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage, because headaches are learned more intensively and with other, effective methods even in early childhood.
Impressive appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis ace Serena Williams is showing off her emotional and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to point out breast cancer and make a strong case for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover up her most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams herself would have died almost a year ago.
There were complications at the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clumps in Serena's lungs were then discovered.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a significant expansion of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill on the so-called "symbol law" under review.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes out her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 metres at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 metres at high intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of new snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße), the road conditions therefore become wintry.
Farmers are allowed to start annual knee care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start the annual knee care on Monday.
The "green ramparts," which are unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the wooded federal state for about 200 years.
The tree and shrub hedges, which are up to five metres wide, are "forest replacement" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect habitats scattered as corridors, through which the exchange of organisms can still work, as Ingo Ludwichowski, managing director of the German Nature Conservation Federation (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of a command of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, which ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limitation and cattle fence, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also dates from that time: by "bending" the branches, the dense, intertwined delimitations could develop.
Today, around 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and give the image of a wooded, diverse landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a replacement habitat by around 7,000 animal species.
In one kilometre of Knick, up to 1,800 different species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly cared for in winter.
Otherwise, it will become a light series of trees that, in addition to biodiversity, will also lose the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, knee care may only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about situation on the ground
In an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the ground on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on the ground during the tsunami yourself?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned of the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive a car for more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport, so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills, where they are still staying for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are staying in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people are sometimes clutching food and petrol.
The public service has been completely shut down, and the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the prisoners run around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information supply on the island going?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that it didn't work and we only got information via the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people who do not know if they are living and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, not a tsunami" - and then it came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran towards the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
But, there are earthquakes every day, but that was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and we also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to give up Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing from VfB Stuttgart for a long time with serious muscle injuries.
Aogo suffered a muscle fibre crack in the back left thigh at 2-1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football league announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle crack in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hanover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the following national game break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast of the downtime.
A muscle bundle crack usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fibre crack usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival closes every year the ranks of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the chants to the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions of recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching fire brigade tried to capture an injured duck.
The action, however, dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers on Lake Olchinger noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the area of the water watchdog station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire brigade.
The first attempts to capture the duck, however, went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the volunteers again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and push it back to land, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a courageous handle.
The duck injured on the chest was then taken to the veterinary clinic of the LMU in Oberschleißheim.
But, according to the initial assessments, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard targets World Cup medal
Fourth place at Olympia was biathlete Julian Eberhard in the stomach for a long time.
Next winter, the Saalfeldener wants to make up for the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old the medal close to grabbing in the Pyeongchang Olympic sprint.
Seven tenths of a second was missing on bronze in the end.
"I deliberately took time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
This makes the Pinzgauer all the more motivated to make up for the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point, you have to strike.
The World Cup cross-country track in Östersund (SWE) is located in Eberhard: "I have already closed the track in my heart," he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN) last World Cup winter.
With the relay he ran in second place in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at a turbocharged pace
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation at a turbocharged pace, Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the skinny majority for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial on coercion charges.
President Donald Trump has set investigators a deadline of Friday to investigate the alleged incidents, which date back more than 30 years.
The latest turn in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's appointment, which was accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer issued angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee was supposed to clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge on the US Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake, contrary to his original announcement, said he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described the serious allegations as "shelling" on Thursday, initially abstained from further attacks on the women and spoke of "happiness in misfortune."
In this way, last doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
They will specifically investigate the known allegations of two women, no more, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: "They don't go on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality of Ried, the mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" to monitor the speed limit will be stationed on Gartenstraße from Monday, October 1.
The Federal School Centre is also located there.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first victory of the season against Mainz.
The relief at Schalke is great after the first victory of the season.
Nevertheless, the factor of time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area, "said the Schalke 04 sports board - and breathed up.
After all, the royal blue had still managed to finish the narrow 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season.
In fact, things could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf had given security to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco: "Overall, the first half was good, both playful and from the pressing point of view," the head obviously played a role more and more with the duration of the game.
Don't really create a headball monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," Heidel said: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The guys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore withdrew further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit: "I'm actually the worst headball player in the team."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was palpable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start impressively in the early stages and make a fireworks out of it," Schalke's head coach said.
Victory was important.
At last we can look forward to a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, quietly and courageously, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau missed out on worrying for clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the bar twice 59th / 72nd or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a tremor victory," Tedesco said: "You felt the fear a bit."
So I am glad that we have won.
He was not the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From a distance of about two kilometres, a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire at around 1.30pm on Sunday.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - Police and fire brigade soon found out the cause: an unknown person had lit rubbish on a two-square-metre area on the Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it seemed as if he had monitored the fire for a long time, but then left the glow unattended.
And that near the forest.
Thirty Fischbachau firefighters were busy pulling apart and extinguishing.
Police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on an equal footing
In front of them stands the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has once again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Kulturpolitik" in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, tangible numbers and one or two jokes, he brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, are conflicts increasingly emerging?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table sits German society, at the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to have a say.
This leads to conflicts.
The decisive factor is therefore not whether one classifies oneself politically on the right or on the left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
Initially rather subdued, then the discussion round starts more and more lively.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands in front, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: it is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not push up his opinion, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing session, he still has an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, there was intensive further discussion.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win opening games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Gießen prevailed in a hard-fought match in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonner won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champions Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich struggled to an 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, while Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg on Saturday with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is apparently huge: more than 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new construction area Landsham-Süd on the open market.
This is what Mayor Roland Frick tells us.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots that the municipality offers at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the former local model - has been completed.
A good 100 applications have been received, Frick said.
"The documents are currently being examined," with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Plieningen, the aim is to have drawn up the candidate rankings for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
After that, the award could take place.
A total of 50 plots for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for apartment buildings with an estimated eight residential units each.
The development is now almost complete, and the roads and paths are to be paved soon.
A single plot as well as two of the apartment buildings belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells most of it on the free market, 20 plots in a social-compatible model.
According to Frick, the municipality's two apartment buildings are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments supported by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
It is roughly estimated that housing for about 200 people is being created on the area of the new construction area Landsham-Süd.
Not only that: now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start of the new construction of a daycare centre is taking place there.
It will house three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalke's Naldo succeeds in "great sport" on the bench
Not in the starting line-up for the third time in a row: nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo had sat Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time in a row not in the Schalker starting eleven, but in the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people if the Brazilian, who is almost two metres tall, had really spoken the frustration of his soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle as usual after the 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05 and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his pros, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo, intervened and said: "We have to thank, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reserve existence, had no resentment.
Probably Naldo, who was hailed as the best Schalker last season, knows that he has not actually got on the pitch with his coach - but gets a break for good reasons.
A reason called "stress control."
It was not easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I say that to you quite honestly," Tedesco said of the moment he told Naldo that he was not in the starting line-up.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the club, "Tedesco explained of the move.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can snap through at the moment.
And that we all keep on board, "Tedesco explained of the rotation, which also caught Naldo recently.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving to be an exemplary team player on the bench.
The mood in Austria's industry accelerated its decline compared to the eurozone in August.
The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low of 46.7 points.
Across Europe, however, Austria has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday for its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone's PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1, but the index is still below the 50 points mark for the 13th month in a row, indicating growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked that threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France, and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but more slowly than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March, at 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened downturn could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry - at least in the third quarter - remains the number one brake on growth.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as much as they have not since November 2011.
The companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
In China, too, industrial production fell more strongly in August than initially thought.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are surveyed.
Tuchel's PSG team succeeds in eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel continues to rush from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
