DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil in the national team.
"This is a question, of course, depends on the fact that you get into a conversation, that you also talk to him why he has apparently felt one or the other, as stated in his statement," said Grindel in football Podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the months-long debate over the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of the 92 -fold national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
At some point in time, I also assumed that would be the case, "Grindel said.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and this also justified by the fact that Grindel did not defend him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not prepared for a conversation with national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build up pressure, but he knew it from football so that when "you leave a team or a club changes, that you talk about it with his coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation has not been made so far" ,
Linz: Garden hut burned in allotment garden
At 14.13 clock the fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage power line leads directly over the allotment garden, danger was in arrears.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire before arriving.
The roof had to be practically completely removed and fire debris to the extent absolutely necessary to be cleared.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had infected a battery for lunch at noon.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, the charger was according to the fire department in the area of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother fights back: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to do this extremely strange thing?
She apparently wanted to snatch children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has even streamed live, as she apparently wants to snatch the children of a family in Moscow.
This reports the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "Lucky kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she claims to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family almost fled from the actress, Lohan pursued the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults to engage in child trafficking.
For all this she provides no evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is watching," says Lohan in the video as she continues to follow the family down the street.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, it seems the obviously angry mother but enough.
It looks like she turns around and slaps Lohan.
In tears, the actress protests how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What has moved Lohan to this action, is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The probe "Hayabusa2" was launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It should approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign Ticker: Number of dead in Sulawesi rises to more than 400

The number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated the devastated and cut-off areas.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chairman
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla boss Elon Musk caused unrest on the stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletroautobauer.

Congress of British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the party congress of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The conference will focus on foreign affairs, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference will be overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson at the forefront.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (on the right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name duplications for years.
Now they have agreed.
In the future, the state of Macedonia will be called North Macedonia and on this Sunday the population will vote - if it's okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The not") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is posing as an anti-system candidate, putting it ahead in the polls.
His fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Labor Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force is still there," said Development Board Peter Mertens the industry newspaper "Automobilwoche".
The imprisoned and suspended Audi CEO Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the taskforce would be dissolved soon.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / transmission combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July we reached an important milestone in the processing of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car maker had made "major organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurs again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to continue this Tuesday to discuss.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss to have approved the sale of diesel cars with false emissions after becoming aware of the Abgasbetrüergien.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Sales Director Bram Schot currently heads the company as Acting Chief Executive Officer.
Because of the conversion to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP give it production losses with Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronner voice".
Basically, he sees a decline in demand for sedans such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electric mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, already had 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm is in the DFB presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil Affair again in the coming year for the post of DFB President.
"I do my work and make an effort to make it as good as it gets," said Grindel as a guest on early Sunday morning in ZDF's "Aktuelle Sportstudio".
You have to try again and again to re-election, I will do that.
And then you have to look, if the support is there too.
According to his own words, the head of the association would find it "weird" if he did not "feel like working on the future project after winning the European Football Championship 2024".
Since April 2016, Grindel has been the head of the association as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the Sommermärchen affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be at the DFB-Bundestag on 27th September 2019.
The future EM chief executive Philipp Lahm is to cooperate according to Grindel in the DFB presidency.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the presidium agree that he will continue to advise on this role in the presidium and then of course be cordially invited to provide his experience in sporting matters," said Grindel.
To speculation whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair to the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan Grindel expressed the desire that should be a national player without a migration background integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is run by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background has a significant impact on society and football, and says 'the issue is important, we need to take care of it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where Integration must work, "said Grindel.

Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite living supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany and to act against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
The city center of Cologne was partially closed for the opening of the Ditib Mosque.
Several thousand policemen were on duty - including snipers.
The Islamic Association Ditib is criticized because it is considered an extension of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: Stars, boos and moments of shock
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have all campaigned for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Get involved wherever you can," said Mendes at the festival on Sunday night in front of some 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a fringed red dress with a gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations were on stage during the several-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a moment of shock, as many spectators were the sound of a falling metal barrier for shots, got scared and tried to escape.
Shortly panic arose, people ran confused.
Seven spectators were thereby slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed people from the stage.
"Nobody is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You are all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the internet as every year.
Those who wanted to get hold of one had to read and share texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease on the internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there were cheers and applause from the audience - boos, however, for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Although he spoke with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken in the Judiciary Committee of the US Senate for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge on the Supreme Court and thus many women offended.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse, including the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which the latter rejects.
Flake challenged an FBI investigation after two women claiming to have themselves committed sexual assault confronted him on the way to a committee meeting in an elevator.
"You're welcome to come with me anytime in a lift," Flake said to the crowd at the New York concert.
Press Freedom: Federal Government defends the journalist's expulsion
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the front row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert said on Sunday.
It was a matter of disrupting the course of the press conference.
The action of the journalist had caused a great unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had therefore caused that bodyguards bring out the man.
Seibert said that it is not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This is completely independent of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in jail.
Many are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades of imprisonment.
Even foreign journalists are not sure about the Turkish authorities: only at the beginning of September the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
Although they were released and were able to return to Germany, but are still running in Turkey against the two trials.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and well-executed: Florian David Fitz.
Since you have to look twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht", produced by the NDR, is well-known for chilling conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbor pub "Schellfischposten".
Presenter Ina Müller and her guest start with a few beers, some wine or even higher-percentage drinks to lighten the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebs also take courage for the obligatory vocal insertions.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time around: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "Men's Heart", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The hottest day".
The Munich got the trip to the far north but not good.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumpled on it, the eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not ill, he only has a powerful hangover.
Directed to his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now won: "Rule One: NEVER go to Ina's Night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And spray.
And the round of eggnog that Ina throws at half past two, also let go.
Alcohol consumption is the 43-year-olds truly written in the face.
His fans posted a few tips to fight the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most effective - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the usually attractive movie star.
How Ina Müller has survived the nocturnal drinking bout is not yet known.
Since she has been moderating the TV fun at the bar but since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced ...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa is struggling with vandalism and filth
The entry into the 36-kilometer cycle track in Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is hard to find and littered.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions are barely distinguishable.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and now dismantled signs - so presents itself for a long time the entrance with a seating group to the bike path on the Haaße-hill in Treysa.
For the flagship object Bahnradweg in Rotkäppchenland a more than inglorious sight.
The topic employs members of the ADFC Ortsgruppe Schwalmstadt but also others for some time, according to the Radverkehrsbeauftragte der Stadt Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the cycling advisory board.
A solution does not exist so far.
The proposals ranged from moving the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic was also included in the local advisory board.
Not only does the rubbish kill cyclists and residents - the seating group is a regular gathering place to celebrate on weekends.
It is not only often loud, in the binges is also destroyed: post torn from the ground, trash cans demolished, signs folded over, smeared seating.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions are only the proverbial drop in the bucket.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting place for a binge drinking.
"Along the entire bike path here on the Haaße-Hill is clearly the focus," confirms the Radverkehrsbeauftragte, which now also worries about the new Radstätte in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive".
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly this sets the threshold much higher to engage in common property.
However, that would require that then a police patrol passes in a timely manner.
Basically, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
He had to be made more attractive.
With the Frequentierung of the bike path so far one could be very satisfied.
The tourism marketing is still expandable.
Our bike lane is very high quality compared to other in Germany, "said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in Ascheröder Strasse in Treysa to be extremely critical.
There is no turn lane on the Haaße hill.
In heavy traffic, cyclists in the middle of the road may have to wait between traffic flow on both sides, "she explains.
That was no problem for sporty drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music contest in the Kulturbahnhof: the "Kö of Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for the music contest was a success, creative and in togetherness.
"D to present a song for Hiltrup", is the appeal of the district initiative Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for young and old, experienced and experienced musicians".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family gathering with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations occurred, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long time living in Hiltrup Albachtener, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, district mayor Joachim Schmidt explained, was a novelty.
We have not experienced that in other districts.
What did the copywriters associate with?
Hiltruper See and Marktallee were particularly popular places.
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue in his hit song as "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also honored.
Again and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short renovation breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or hints to their work.
So it was learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaching guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann Franke knew to report that recently in Ludwigshafen occurred - at a major event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed a lot on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomie.
Nevertheless, there was something special for the jury's favorites - so that others could hear their songs as well.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record a whole CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Hehmig with his Hiltrup hit, the Franke particularly impressed with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very beautiful appearance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all, the children performed again for the final - and sounded "really good" even without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Business Association and Jan Kaven, chairman of the district initiative.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She rated the event a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon-to-be-crowded cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams sitting opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords that you can decipher - the old trick with the red foil - only when you put them into it.
This ensures that the other party can not read anything by accident.
For example, on the maps you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2 Windows.
3. cubes.
4th festival ".
These are the terms that should be encrypted from now on.
For it is not the concepts that are to be guessed here, but codes.
Alternately one player per team is the Encryptor.
He gets a code card on which maybe "3.4.2". stands.
In "Decrypto" it is not supposed to guess the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube", "hard" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not ; because that wins the game if he twice succeeds in cracking the code.
The encrypter notes and reads aloud: "throw" for the dice, "lots" as opposed to fixed; Here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he was paying attention at school and knows the local lintel.
So it goes round by round, team by team.
Although one does not know the terms of the other side - this can be better understood with every clue the encryptor gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too fancy should be the rewriteings, otherwise it makes his team unnecessarily difficult.
The most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rulebook.
The players must probably study it quite long and in detail, until they can finally play.
The explanatory video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you have started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames", which also turns an agent's topic into a game less words, but much better to play in small groups.
And if it's all about guessing and not about victory points, it's easy to add a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler salute in the Upper City of a passing police patrol, later he also fell in the upper town in a pub when he molested other guests.
After he clearly drunk did not comply with the issued refusal by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the detention cell.
In the sober state, he must also be responsible for the use of license plates of unconstitutional organizations.
Plant Pressig was home to the Schubloks
The railway depot in Pressig was for decades the hub in the Franconian Forest.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers hit buffers, you could hear it all over Pressig," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That did not upset anyone.
The brakes squealed and the cars chattered.
That was just pure railroad.
Statements that symbolize Dinkel's home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Franconian Forest was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which has its peak in Steinbach am Wald after an increase of about 220 meters.
To cope with this, formerly locomotive and thrust locomotives were needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 engine sheds, an apprentice workshop, overhead line and track maintenance.
"The centerpiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and 47-year-old professional railroader.
From the railway depot (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, locomotives were also operated for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950 reported the "People's Journal" of a staff of 160 men; Thirteen steam locomotives and eight electric locomotives were stationed at Pressig.
The electrification of the 1939 line already minimized the need for traction and thrust locomotives.
From 1977 they were only needed for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 cars were ranked each month.
Parts of the depot were demolished in 1982 and the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is unfortunate that one did not envisage a better use of the location, also in terms of freight traffic."
At Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary "50 Years of Electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, the off.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the marshalling yard Pressig was history.
"The shunters and brakemen completed the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Every mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current images can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with kick-off success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges the second round.
Kerber won at the China Open 6: 2, 6: 2 against the Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6: 3, 4: 2 against Daria Kassatkina, as set to number 13 Russian.
The Swabian now has to deal with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the "Art and Enjoyment" series, a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend.
Organizers and visitors registered with great relief the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the estate Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the Tourism Association "Around Walberla" as part of the series "Art and enjoyment".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be viewed in Mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
But with Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer he put his task into proven, young hands with a good future.
Both have been actively involved in the selection of artists and have helped shape flyers in the past.
Once again this year there will be a special 70 cent stamp designed by Kunst & Genuss, available at every art station.
There, this year's poster "Betzn austenanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased about the high popularity of the special exhibition.
For the musical accompaniment Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won.
As you walk through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
These are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with colored accents.
Already at the entrance of the property the visitor on the right side expects the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in color, playfully equipped with 20 pinwheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the shrubbery in the background, the object appears fairytale-like and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers in three-dimensional letters the event 15 years K & G dedicates.
There are many parts, moving in the wind.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The topic "wind chimes performance" for a stroll through the versatile art exhibition.
Until 31 December 2018 the special exhibition can be visited.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singer celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And also the Albachtener made then their displeasure air.
At least five of them.
They did not want to resign themselves to the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 Albachten from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
"It will be full today," guessed chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball became it, to festive clothes had been asked before.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt well enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the "Dream Ship".
Now she speaks openly that the series could have been partly to blame for her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left the ship forever.
The series that made her a star might be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled alone around the world with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues perceived me at eye level, "says Keller in an interview with" Bild am Sonntag ".
At first she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "dream ship".
For now the journalists only called on Heide Keller.
"I do not know if he enjoyed it so much".
She thinks it's possible that her husband at the time might have been jealous, but "how many men did Hans shy away from talking about problems and feelings."
Keller always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody "and he did not want to get to know my fears and my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I'm wrong ", as she explains further.
She always felt that she was "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, whom in truth I never was, even if I sometimes appeared bold and bold on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever ".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said Yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time".
The day before the civil wedding, I sat in the cloak howling and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage of Borsody also failed.
Why it never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had love at that time "as presented in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I approached love too naïve. "
The moth, who regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ Zurich resort, has ventured this time to the ZFF opening party.
Our butterfly is not a moth, but a little light-shy.
And the glare, in which a green carpet is bathed on the Sechseläutenplatz, blinds him excessively.
But it's just a film festival, as more or less famous people want to bask in the spotlight.
So he tottered across the square on this late Thursday evening to briefly relieve himself in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet complex sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: the emergency facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion struggles to create a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, stinks in the men's oasis for some reason to heaven.
So out here, over on the other side of the street: invited guests, who in the cinema next door the opening film "Green Book" entertained just at the best level, celebrate like every year the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name is a perfect match for this film festival: the works shown originate from the entire globe.
What do you have to come up with an article about this festival not everything, so as not to fall into surreptitious advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The moth ties a ribbon around the feelers that a fairy godmother has given him, and two beefy doormen actually wave generously at him.
Inside, the invited invite themselves to dance far past midnight to live music, or be tempted by DJ rhythms, to which they shout at each other, and down with Cüpli exquisite appetizers.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement oysters wait for sizzling mouths, next door is the incomparable prosciutto Culatello di Zibello freshly sliced, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been dispelled for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for that!
The moth studies the sign by the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these are two separate instructions, he has squandered in dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and that has certainly saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the winged man tipped an espresso-prepared cocktail called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
The price for the best drink does not necessarily get this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting the brand for years, is not here tonight.
But there, between local celebrities, checkout counter, and kitchen items, a face appears familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
Since his main actor should not be far.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, soon to be almost a choirboy, walks through the crowd.
He is not talked into, not gawked, at most he is stealthily turned on.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as misery, international stars love this film festival.

Only the initial phase "we have overslept", annoyed the ASV coach.
Quickly led the home side with 8: 1, even the early break, the Bieletzki had taken, initially did not fruit.
"But then suddenly a jolt went through the team," summarized Bieletzki the second quarter of an hour together.
At break, the gap was only two more goals.
Especially Sender's best, Marius Hintze, met in the phase again and again.
After the change, it was even better from the visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst equalized for 15:15, then led the relay changer almost throughout.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly soothing three goals (29:26).
And then?
Involved the impartial in the action.
Bieletzki is usually careful not to seek blame on others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff conceded was "a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and scored four goals until the end - while the declined ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, in the back against seven men stood well and repeatedly thrown on the empty goal.
Only they can buy a little for the compliments.
"Now has to make a damned victory," said the fully served Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Announcement at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says, in times of Tinder, there are no more romantic introductory stories - should talk to Aldi about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast-food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket radiates almost an anachronistic romanticism as a meeting place for great love.
Yeah, right, talking about reduced turkey, boxer shorts at the garbage table or your favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The App Tinder is reputed to be less a contact, but rather a slippery stock market.
We dared the test: How do women react, you do not talk long in the first message around the bush?
Here the amazing result.
True Hollywood Lovestory potential has it when love-luck is preceded by a lost-and-found plot.
If the guy then also at the email address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de at his beloved, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Co. - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the creator of this ad in an unknown Aldi branch to wish that she will find her dream man, with whom she talked briefly about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat", also.
For the belief in the magic of the analogue acquaintance, she has earned her happy ending à la Hollywood in any case.

Football: District League: Researcher appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court with his family.
Word of mouth he gave himself, the coach of the football district division VfL Wolbeck, retired first (inwardly) to reflect on the lack of motivation on the green.
All history.
Meanwhile, it is running again around the Brandhoveweg.
Dauffrischer voucher is the 1: 1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season just gossiped past the ascent.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
That was something to be proud of ", praised Fetsch his boys and looked after each individual after the game to simply say" thank you "for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.

Following the injury of Nico Frerich's (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - the 4-4-2 went almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes was in the lead for the ball.
Wolbeck had significantly more play in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his retirement (17), substitutes Luca Rehberg (26) and Jan Schroer (38) missed the lead.
It almost took his revenge when SCA made two dangerous attacks against Wolbecker Kasten in minute 41 by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL brazenly took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters narrowly failed.
Schroer was too late in a Thewes cross after 58 minutes.
With the replacement of Miles Geske Fetsch missed the left side again a fresh cell.
When Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer felled Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free kick for the home team 18 meters in front of the visitors' goal.
The foul kicked himself and demonstrated his dangerousness to standards.
Westhues "Ding with the right slap struck in the bottom left corner from the point of view of the shooter - 1: 0 (71.).
20 minutes left, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th minute, the leather in the penalty area unhappy to the hand.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolke had to survive in the final stages, before Geske had hit the winner in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
It might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women are a rarity on company boards
As a result, only 8 percent of board members were female as of September 1, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", officially launched this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and pre-eminent to the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to put things differently, otherwise pull the international competitors past them," said Foundation CEO Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male-occupied management teams are - with a few exceptions - long unthinkable.
The gap makes the German competitors in comparison less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among the German stock market companies is also due solely to positive impulses in the companies of the index of medium-sized stocks (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still at 3.8 percent.
The proportion of women among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - stagnated.
Last 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women in the coming year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement have signaled that they will continue to make no commitment to increase their share of "zero percent" so far.
The supervisory boards have a different picture: on 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"If you recruited just as many women a year for the board members, a share of 40 percent would have been achieved by 2023," the report says.

Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices ranging from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in earnings before interest and taxes.

Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
After the embarrassing end in the League Cup Manchester United now also loses in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United ManU is 1: 3. The way of defeat may still be talked about.
Symbolic was the scene in the 74th minute, in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot the 3-1; Just three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly brought the Red Devils back into the game.
Since they suspected an offside at the pass of Mark Nobel, remained all defensive players from Manchester, and let Arnautovic all the time in the world, the ball to shoot past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of an insufficient performance over long distances.
Quite different is currently the mood of United's city rivals Manchester City.
The Citizens coached by Mourinho's big rival Pep Guardiola scored against Brighton & Hove Albion for a 2-0 victory.
After half an hour broke Raheem Sterling for the home team for the first time the defense of the outsider.
Sergio Agüero made sure after a good hour and a double with the former goal scorer to ensure the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus for the leap to the top of the table.
Liverpool is no longer a table leader
Three days after losing 2-1 at Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought 1-1 with Liverpool in the Premier League against Chelsea.
As with the Cup-out of the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in the London.
The 27-year-old's 25th-minute goal was the only goal of the match until the final stages.
Shaqiri, who came into the field 66 minutes into the game for Mohamed Salah, narrowly missed the equalizer after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds started the week with a perfect record, Chelsea was unbeatable for the second time.
First, the London eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, by the draw in the league, the Blues Liverpool now also topped the table.
Like City, London's city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 victories.
However, Gunners' fans playing Granit Xhaka had to wait until the 81st minute to signal a victory against the surprise team from County Hertfordshire.
Watford defender Craig Cathcart unleashed a cross from Alex Iwobi's own net nine minutes from time, only two minutes later Mesut Özil scored his third goal of the season.
Arsenal pulled away from Watford thanks to their fifth win in a row and are now ranked fifth right behind their big rival Tottenham. Forwards Wolverhampton, under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo, still have a strong impression.
The Wolves remained unbeaten in the 2-0 win against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row, taking 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of the German auto companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showing their new products in the French capital next week, together with the competition from all over the world.
The diesel does not really matter much anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which should be negotiated until then with the government in Berlin, but should still be an important topic at least behind the shiny backdrops of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is indeed with Audi, Porsche and other daughters here, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have, among other things, their first pure electric models here: The e-tron of Ingolstadt should come at the end of the year on the market, the Stuttgart EQC 2019.
Both were officially presented.
The iNext from BMW should start only in 2021.
The focus in Paris is the new 3 Series.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from the 4th to the 14th of October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers and numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a good one million visitors came.
At least 380 people were killed in the devastating earthquakes and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and traffic connections are damaged, causing enormous damage to property.
After the quake, the tsunami broke over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a party.
It is feared that the numbers of victims are still going up significantly.
So far, the numbers are only from Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for the motorcyclists at the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS strong cyclist.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) at Haus Nordhelle takes place on the last Sunday of each month.
Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, some 150 bikers gathered on Sunday to do anything but ordinary worship.
Already from 10 o'clock the Boliden were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
First, the biker brunch was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team were also the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, there.
The sermon was delivered by Pastor Dirk Grzegorek during the biker service.
For the musical accompaniment provided the singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill suggests rather poetic-quiet tones," said Rev. Frank Schröder.
This was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a big party: the milk comes after the apple
And also on the actual day of action Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and showed his astonished spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Now and then Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and had them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle power was from the apples a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how it would turn out to be a tasty drink.
But even this important step they could look at this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in molds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the pieces of apple, which looked a bit like chopped shreds, layer by layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was not that difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the Füchtorfer farmer had also already bottled specialties here.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the older Federweisser to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly large.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children could not only pursue the process of cider pressing, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Active members of the Füchtorfer Kameradschaft of former soldiers were involved in the festival and invited to some stations for entertaining games.
Also in the coming year, the home club will offer a day of action.
But then, as Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home town in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the scene of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
That is also obvious because of the topic: Finally, it will go around the milk.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season bankruptcy: "shitty situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat succession coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around and gave them courage.
A lot of positive things were previously in the 1: 4 (0: 2) of the bottom of the table at Eintracht Frankfurt but not seen.
"It's a crappy situation, but you have to come out there as a team," said 96-time professional footballer Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "That's obviously disappointing, because you always take a lot in front of you."
The continued winless Lower Saxony, for whom only Florent Muslija (86.) met for the connection, are with two counters at the bottom and are in their current condition a relegation candidate.
However, led by the towering Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated its first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored in front of 46,300 spectators the goals for the DFB Cup winners, after the successful dress rehearsal for The European League game against Lazio Roma advanced seven points into the midfield of the table.
Croatia's Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hessians at his start-up debut and never got a grip on Hanover's defense.
The striker, who had suffered a lot after the World Cup, showed with his speed and assertiveness why he is so valuable to Eintracht.
In addition to Rebic also lent from Liverpool Brazilian Allan was the first time in the starting lineup of Frankfurter, who began swinging.
Lucas Torró's header was deflected onto the goal net for the first time (17 minutes).
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defense to the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-circuit Kevin Wimmer (back).
The lead for the home side almost inevitably and completely earned.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the box with a corner kicked in, and Haller headed in front of the goal, where Ndicka needed only to keep his foot shut.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the come in the summer of the French second division AJ Auxerre defender.
And Frankfurt relented before the break.
This time Haller fit on his strike partner Rebic, who skilfully fueled and 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser left no chance.
At half-time Hannover coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak performance of his team and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Niedersachsen played a bit more courageously forward, however, sparking ideas remained until shortly before the end, as at least still succeeded the connecting goal.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After just under an hour Rebic launched a solo and then put across on De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was for the Frankfurt against overburdened guests only showcases, also Jovic met one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city center.

Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on 14 September or on the Sunday after.
The festival service takes place in the town church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, who came from the Thirty Years' War and is said to have shot a Swedish soldier.
From the gunshot wound then flowed blood.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished yet, only the sanctuary is, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his homily, Pastor Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was in spite of the importance for the Geisinger parish poorly attended.
After the service the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing ended the ecclesiastical part of the Cross Festival.
For many years, the Catholic church choir then invited to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish hall.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed on behalf of the parish the visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, the sandstone works and windows and the upcoming construction, which is still in the next Be dragged on for a year.
After the scaffolding has been standing for some time, the damage could be more accurately determined and the individual tenders prepared more concrete.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the already existing damage a few years ago have become larger, but it has also been found more, which was only possible through the inspection by means of scaffolding.
The base plasters are finished, before the winter is still to be started with the natural stone work and it is hoped to finish well half of this work this year.
Inauguration: New dorm in the Neu-Ulm Münsterblickstraße
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller is opening a new dormitory for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" is given its purpose - there were all present at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the dormitory of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas have been considered by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first planning began about eight years ago, when the former US Army officer's room was put to the test for the residents with handicap: "The house was getting old and outdated in terms of equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved to demolish the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible, so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450000 euros.
The construction work, according to architect Bader remained in the planned framework - time and financially.
He was also thanked by the managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz.
The balancing act between barrier-free and fireproof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which allows the residents to experience the freedom to be able to move without outside help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, Gertrud Kreutmayer said: "The house is based on the special needs of its residents who need tools to be mobile".
Here, the comfort and functionality was well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it is no longer to acquire in the current situation".
Altogether, the new dormitory in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1,500 square meters, divided into three residential groups.
Life support manager Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed by tariff.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Prior to the Day of Unity, the vice-president of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to all compatriots not to resign themselves to the discrimination of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after nearly 30 years of unity.
We can not be satisfied with these differences, "said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the" Tagesspiegel am Sonntag ".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germans worked longer hours on average than people in West Germany, but 15 percent less salary.
"I can explain that to anyone almost 30 years after the German Unification," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan hunting dog is to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an attempt to ease ties with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae In to two North Korean Pungsan hounds.
As Moons office announced on Sunday, the two about one year old dogs reached their receiver on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to make it easier for the animals to "settle in".
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the National Cultural Heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North had announced its friendship at the third summit meeting this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and to jointly apply for the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion.
Austria's eventful history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months now, numerous new books have appeared, which answer this question mostly in retrospect to the past hundred years.
In a very different way, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it in Austria's magnificent "picture book", which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to work - that's the unofficial motto for the working week of the Grand Coalition starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU last did not invoke the "return to work" mantraartig.
This may have led some craftsmen, women doctors, cashiers, and other economically active citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what the difference really is between work and paperwork, but that's all.
If the federal government is ready to return to its mission - governing - it should not be stopped now with conceptual debates.
Whether Union and SPD after the provocation and embarrassment of the last few weeks can actually bring something together, may even show Monday.
In the evening, the heads of the governing parties come together for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the quarrels.
At first, however, conflict-laden topics are once again on the agenda with the diesel retrofits and the skilled labor immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the auto companies with exchange premiums get off lightly, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to retrofit older diesel.
While in the diesel crisis over the weekend, a rapprochement has emerged, Union and SPD are still far apart in the planned Fachkräftezuwanderungsgesetz.
The SPD calls for a retention perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or training.
The Union is strictly against "changing lanes" from the asylum system to the labor market.
So there will be another quarrel between the coalition partners - and how could it be otherwise?
Not equal and equal to GroKo has joined together, but three partners with sometimes very different images of society and priorities.
Quarrel is good.
Without dispute, one of such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests subscribed society does not progress.
But in order to be constructive, quarrels must not be exaggerated again for party-tactical reasons to the question of being or not-being.
It's still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD are to argue - but always have the reality of life in mind.
What is feasible and benefits many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be pragmatically clarified - and regain confidence.
Above all, the people's parties must now fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the sights
Does the Minister of Labor, of all people, violate the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Really day and night," their legists had worked on the social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
List-Mushroom-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger encounters the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) on surprise - she brings the matter now via request to Parliament.
She assumes "that the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the use of her team and in no way wanted to announce violations of applicable service law in front of cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to "acquit Hartinger of any suspicion."
Police raid a street on search for woman's corpse
Marxgrün - Lange did not want to comment on the police.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning is dug on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is blocked in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
This had been preceded by the fact that the investigators had previously used an archeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with his guide, was able to limit the relevant area to a few meters in repeated use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of said street section.
For more than a year already prosecutor and criminal police yard edit the missing person case.
Again and again, a bike path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar equipment, because the investigators suspect that here in the course of the construction of the state highway 30 years ago Heike's body could have been buried.
Color powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona in front of Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia marks the first anniversary.
But already before it comes to riots.
The separatists did not forget the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and the police took place in the center of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the pro-independence activists with paint powder, among other things, to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and Civil Guards.
Some 3,000 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honor a rally with their colleagues who were deployed in the polling stations last year as illegal referendums.
In the attempt to prevent citizens voting, it had also come to violence.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the 6,000 or so separatists would have tried to break the police cordon by force, and thrown the officials, among other things, at paint bags and eggs.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, according to the authorities.
On Monday is the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split off the affluent region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had forced Catalonia into receivership in autumn 2017.
The former regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, however, remain in custody.
New elections had been held in the region in December.
Following the inauguration of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the "right of self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Gathering helplessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate scoreless
Red-White Ahlen continues on the spot.
Also at FC Gütersloh it was only enough to a 0-0 draw.
The tail light and the third last showed them in front of 438 spectators in the Heidewald stadium as a gathering helplessness.
The first half was manageable by the entertainment factor arg.
Anyone who would rather get a beer or a sausage could do so without worries.
There was no danger of missing a chance to score, because there were practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) shot on goal in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle only real - opportunity had the Ahlener, as Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling forced after 32 minutes with a shot from the edge of the penalty area to a parade.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute targeted Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters just over the case and after one hour, the Gütersloher occurred for the first time offensively in appearance.
After a ball conquest of Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed.
Nick Flock (62) came on top with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann on a fast counterattack over Sinan Aygün.
In addition, they laid with a header from Wieckowicz (66.) for a corner kick of ex-Ahleners Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, bringing first Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahlener did not materialize.
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but also brought nothing.
Angelo Daut tried afterwards to emphasize the positive: "I like that we played to zero". But unfortunately, the zero also stood in front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent did not feel like playing here," said RW Ahlen coach.
Offensively, "everything was splashing a bit against a team that just wanted to defend.
Anyway, I did not feel we could concede a goal, "said Daut.
To his chagrin, however, one did not feel as a spectator, as if his team could score a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Thanksgiving Market: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for whom these donations are intended, are happy about this.
The volunteers assure: "These donations will remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, the space was still a bit empty, but that should change later in the day.
Because: "Here it is so sociable, so we are here today," said a visitor.
Organizer of the party Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a good dose of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, which should be weighed against food, jumped in the short term Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough kreimers.
And the "replacement" did not miss the opportunity to musically entertain the increasing number of visitors.
It was so good that some folk songs were sung late at night.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer was pleased.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is happy about the many players with their stands, mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should not be something like a blackboard," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the dedication of everyone involved in the stalls and also included the other festivities that took place in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden city is a colorful painting - here's what.
Then the Maikranz was taken by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire department and taken to the winter quarters.
At many stalls was worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty everything was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has been living in Reckenfeld for only a year, became creative on his scroll saw.
Veneer works, beer mats with Reckenfelder motifs and much more he had on offer.
A beekeeper offered three specialties: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has another specialty.
Honey cake in the glass, of course, with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to access again and again, so good was the cake.
It is the conviviality that lures the visitors into the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Graffiti with local political message: No successful advertising for skateboarding
In Lengerich, unknown persons advertised the construction of a skate park in a way that was hardly beneficial.
In several places there are corresponding graffiti, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case has been filed with the police criminal complaint for damage to property.
In large letters on signs at the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall, among other things, the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!"
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reported that already after the career choice fair on 19 September a corresponding lettering was discovered on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt Bistro.
Since the short message was at that time apparently "only" left with an Edding, she could easily be removed.
"A few days later, it was back, sprayed this time," said Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note gets just this case in that on the board also several large companies from Lengerich are called.
If the Skateanlage is built, their realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already pledges, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban school, sports and culture department, without naming names.
It is quite possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smudged board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the subject of skating equipment.
After the old had been dismantled at the fiber optic clinic, began after some time the search for an alternative location.
The council finally spoke out in favor of the fire department parking lot.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors were apparently against a building at this point.
The end of June was followed by a turnaround.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee unanimously voted in favor of the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says to the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word is then the city council.
He is starting from a decision this year, so that could be built on a positive vote in 2019.
Bottleneck in air traffic control gets worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, the German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm," said the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known staff shortage in the European air traffic control, for which there is no quick fix.
"The airlines and airports can make quick improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," the unionist said.
Throughout Europe, the market for fully trained pilots was swept clean.
In the center of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace were missing about a hundred people.
Maas again criticized the fact that several aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the federal government, the states, air traffic control, the airlines and the airports gather on Friday to tackle the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work and overtime, that will not work without us," said the head of the GdF, which has many members of the federal German air traffic control.
Maas again made the EU Commission responsible for the pilot misery.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period until 2019 have been much too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings at the national air traffic control services now fully apply to the operative business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU), to use in Brussels for regulations that the air traffic control "not the air even further."
At present, the EU targets would be coordinated by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is exposed to constant lobby pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now harvesting exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high delays incurred by the airline companies led to a rethink.
The GdF will contribute to the improvement of the situation only if the German air traffic control (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," said Maas.
The previously announced intake of 120 pilot students per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes in favor of Group restructuring
The members of the ThyssenKrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favor of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the wishes of ThyssenKrupp's interim head Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday, the troubled group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional redundancies beyond the already known cuts in administration.
After two resignations, the control panel counts only eight heads on the capital side.
This is countered by ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to reach a general meeting in 2020.
Among other things, the new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business with elevators and subcontracting is to be bundled.
Barcelona: violence in demos of police and Catalan independence activists.
Two concurrent demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence activists in Barcelona have given rise to violent clashes with numerous casualties.
According to the city administration gathered on Saturday about 3000 police officers from all over Spain, as demonstrated about 6000 independence advocates.
The Catalan police had tried with a large contingent to keep the two protest trains from each other.
According to the forces, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and missiles.
Scandals were also reported between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
The police said there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police had wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who had opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia banned by the Spanish central government nearly a year ago.
At the same time they demanded better salaries.
Spanish police and Guardia Civil officials find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators found it provocative that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona, of all places.
"Why did you come here to protest?" 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez asked news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they beat us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who wanted to give his name only to Daniel, rejected the charge.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who did their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the police officer assured.

Football: Juve coach praises after top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker had "played the best game together with the half hour of Valencia this evening", praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3-1 (1-1) victory of the record champions against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive bought star was also without his own goal, the key man in the important match against the pursuers.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good on our first goal - and from that moment on we've grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three assists, Juve struck the game after the early deficit from the goal by Dries Mertens (10th minute) and for the time being suspended his closest rival.
Real Madrid's top scorer initially relegated former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic to a double (26-49) for the lead.
And Ronaldo made after a corner by header and the groundwork for the goal by defensive boss Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who just had to insert just before the goal line.
"He gives many assists," praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record scorer both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team.
"We have to be even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Mandzukic are top scorer with four goals - Ronaldo has three.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the immaculate series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already six-point advantage over Naples.
Former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti trained second on the table against Turin did not have a chance.
But at the latest after the dismissal of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top match was decided.
The Portuguese had to go to hard entry against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the square.
"We played well against a good Napoli," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was welcome as well.
The German international has prevailed at Juve.
The come from Liverpool professional was in all seven league games in use.
The midfielder also played Valencia in the Champions League game, with Allegri's "half-hour" deadline: Ronaldo flew off the field in a 2-0 win for the Turin and is suspended for Tuesday's home game against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly bizarre appearance, rapper Kanye West caught the attention of the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" at the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume for frowning and questioning the spectators.

Henceforth one may call him only "Ye", so the musician.
"The creature that used to be known as Kanye West," he tweeted, referring to the late singer Prince when he dropped his stage name.
The pseudonym is not news.
Already the tenth album appeared under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist stated that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think" Ye "is the most used word in the bible and it means" you "," said the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak match today.
The opponent was just more gripping, we have almost never faced problems. "Accordingly thin is the list of Hoetmarer bullet options.
Just two chances to score in 90 minutes, so that rarely games can make positive.
Football league A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst 0: 2 (0: 1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG had only two options in the first round, the first but Maik Krause used from an acute angle to the early lead (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preliminary work by Krause, he flopped free-standing.
The hosts had only a double opportunity as Moritz Höne first goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher failed and found in addition Jan Blome also in Sendenhorster keeper his master.
After the break, the guests were even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) forgave all.
A hand penalty - Louis Kortenjann had rescued on the goal line with the hand and saw for it red - could also Niklas Eilmann also not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide poked the ball over the line, the game was decided (81).
"We had previously criticized ourselves hard, that was then different today than in recent weeks," was the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0: 1 Krause (7th), 0: 2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3: 4
"I do not know what to make of it," he argued for words.
"We have no access to the get". With that he allegedly meant the wing-tongs with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all other green-whites, who noticed with collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winking cheekily and then moved away from his players, however, the relief was to be noted that they had pulled out with three points from the affair.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, namely, Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for survival.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes that were behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"It's been phenomenal how we come back after the 0-2 draw, how we keep up with one of the league's top teams over the entire season."
All the more bitter it seems that now you have to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner gave the hosts the lead with his 12th goal of the season (24 ').
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2: 0 he put on the left side exemplary on for Fabian Fröhning (39).
We knew that, but you can not take out such a player completely.
"That was amazing what he did," Lewandowski unreasonably recognized the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the break, his own team managed to equalize: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long corner (45 ').
After the break, it was again McGill, who equalized (59.).
After that it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64.), just five minutes later equalized Patrick Horstmann (69).
Despite the overpower, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia goal (80th) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1: 0 Zymner (24), 2: 0 Fröhning (39), 2: 1 McGill (45), 2: 2 McGill (59.), 3: 2 Nübel (64), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74./Albachten).

Erdogan in Germany: politics instead of pomp

Protestant Academy Tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: As Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Protestant Academy.
But before and after Wulff was there as a guest.
This is how Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him when he said proudly: "All Federal President and Federal Chancellor were already with us". The fact that celebrities appear again and again at the academy in Tutzing Castle was also an issue when presenting the annual program.
At the end of October singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective. On September 29, the writer Frido Mann will be talking about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: He wants to personally accept the "Tolerance Award" given to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which also receives TV presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it all.
"The pension is not safe!" is in a conference title.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a conference on Syria:" barbarism without limit ".
Weapon deals, destruction, torture, death - the war mocks any humane idea ".
From structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor and the radical change of work through digitization, the spectrum ranges.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to seek solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a conference on the 200th
Karl Marx's birthday soon will see more visitors in the direction of criticism of capitalism, the others more likely a tendency "from left to center".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "So we are not 100 percent neutral."
Musikkabarett: Gender communication with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret actress Teubner explored the understanding between the sexes, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and whatever else there may be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
On the wing sat Ben Süverkrüp.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to the end of the sentence, and on the other hand a true pianist: So congenially harmonious, Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies the fact that some may have desired a solo.
There was also that, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, the way it suited the thread of the evening.
Then Teubner had brought a paradox into play: The satisfaction with the man came, if he had a partner, but this does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner on the other hand brings no benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: what would have sprung from composing Mozart, would "the Nannerl" open the door unexpectedly?
Thus, Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt full of blood and wounds" into the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's G minor Symphony into a playful little dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Blumen presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not accept any additional thanks.
She had the idea to treat the duo in addition to appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt and one in Wolbeck.

Handball: Women's national league: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlenerinnen had problems especially with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, which alone marked ten hits.

Essen has accepted in the two-bar, but has not come into play.
We have employed her well.
Our opponent has pitched with high risk, but also produced quite a few tickets.

"The opening of the mosque in Cologne left a pile of shards in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be met with difficulty," said TGD Chairman Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German side would have missed the opportunity for a common, conciliatory performance.
"Instead of emphasizing the affiliation of Muslims to Germany side by side with German leaders, Erdogan used the appointment for his purposes," complained Sofuoglu.
The extensive exclusion of the German public had "many reservations".

After the long summer break is finally Folktreff time again.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 19.30 clock organizes the home club Nottuln already his fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the old Amtmannei.
Almost to the day it is then a year since we have performed a Folktreff for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln, "says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
That our Folktreff established so quickly in Nottuln, I would not have thought.
Whether Storm Deep Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colorful mixture of German folk songs, traveling songs and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites befriended musicians to Nottuln.
For the first Folktreff "birthday" Klaus Spellmeyer has agreed with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighboring Steinfurt, which played music with Low German texts.
Now he is traveling with an Irish folk band.
The organizers of the Folktreff like to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" inspired the audience and sent them home with a catchy tune.

From pure fruit to ecology
A gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle celebrated the 125th anniversary of the District Association for Horticulture and Landscaping.
On September 29, 1893, a fruit show in the Kulmbach clubhouse set the last founding impulses for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbach Stadthalle.
Of course he was then still different: As a "district fruit growing association Kulmbach city and country" he was raised by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893 from the baptism.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from today's work - in fact, it was all about fruit-growing, and nobody thought about flowers and horticulture at that time.
"At that time, in the epoch of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elite," said Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his speech.
Fruit trees should line highways, in schools so-called industrial gardens were created.
Even today, fruit cultivation is still the responsibility of the 55 horticultural clubs in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise nearly 7,000 members.
But that does not exhaust the spectrum by far.
Close-to-nature horticulture, biological crop protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as large a role as the transfer of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Moles" were entertaining on stage, demonstrating how versatile the tasks of a horticultural club are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said Günter Reif, chairman of the district council, and OB Henry Schramm also emphasized how important natural experiences are for life.
The chestnut harvesting was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that with Smartphone & Co. similar joy can collect.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with district administrator Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where to stand, decides the district association," added District Söllner and emphasized the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district, it also left district manager and consultant Friedhelm Haun no doubt.
He led the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the district association and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the old days everything came from the garden, for the winter it was gassed.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the kitchen garden turned into a decorative and residential garden.
"The nature has survived, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," pleaded the specialist for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, there is an incentive for the horticultural associations, not to let up, so that our home stay beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens in our clubs, added the President of the Bavarian State Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower players of the Musikverein Thurnau.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister publishes UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: They provide both trading partners with an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives the trade agreement absolute priority - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Because of the time constraints in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico, the Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will speak only on Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, said her spokesman Adam Austen.
In the meantime, she is focusing on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canada and the US negotiators had 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement that had already been made between his country and the US.
The US and Mexico had agreed in August on a recast of the regional free trade agreement Nafta.
US President Donald Trump hinted that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they should now be brought to a conclusion, Trump's government wants to present the agreement before October 1, the US Senate.
In case of failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that it was seeking a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
According to a report in the daily O Globo, the far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform in the last week before the presidential elections in the South American country public appearances.
The politician had been attacked in early September during an election campaign in southern Brazil on the street.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
The associations also mobilized racist and feminist statements against Bolsonaro's social networks.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the business metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital city of Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption, and therefore can not stand for election.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As former mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad has far outnumbered far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls so far.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, it has recently become an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round of elections reaches the absolute majority, there will be a runoff election on October 28th.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known for inciting homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula's left-wing Labor Party should be shot.

The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen said on Larsen's website.
At his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been under treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become acquainted with the band Gasolin ', which was enormously successful in the 70s in Scandinavia.
Their songs were influenced by international music greats like Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and The Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978 Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen honored Larsen on Sunday in a statement as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen occurred in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at jackhammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and set off a concert evening with the power of a tiger". The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone make such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the civic center Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock by three friendly bands.
After the soundcheck and shortly before the beginning of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of stage fright.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - visibly enthrall the approximately 120 visitors to the "Mint Mosquito" rock night with their bands.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows to kick off the concert even with the latest, unknown pieces from their own pen and to convince the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to create harmonious and powerful interplay.
Although "encore" calls can not be ignored, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate with their alternative, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s, that hard rock is not just hard rock.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the yearning, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" captivates with the change of melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock reefs of the multilayered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has, however, earned a special reputation since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
It is obvious and unmistakable that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann sets in the interplay with the band even the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s, very own accents.
In the meantime, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo to the sound, which is even more highly controlled than ever, and runs through the audience.
A certain volume of course belongs to such a hard rock concert, because of the genre: At the "Mint Mosquito" - Rock Night, according to the information of the mixing team, the three-piece concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" at about 98 decibels.
That's about the level of jackhammers, but is still well below the level of "Wacken-Fesitval", to which "The Ignition" points on its website.
The Ahlen audience does not need deafening 120 decibels in jet engine volume, as is the case with the annual metal rendezvous in the north of the republic.
After just under four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking gang have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
"Here we are, taking the bone saw and setting off a concert evening with the strength of a tiger", all three groups can say in the end, admittedly in the figurative sense.
And especially the big applause of the visitors.

Trump tells Kim, "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that the US President, North Korea's ruler Kim, is well disposed despite the nuclear crisis.
Now Trump made his colleague a real declaration of love.
This also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has committed to a new flame.
The tragic: It's a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the state of West Virginia, Trump found almost affectionate words for the half-old scion of the Pyongyang dynasty, though it turns out to be quite tough in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, so was he, and we were going back and forth between us," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
OK?
No really.
And not only the talks with Kim had melted his heart.
He wrote beautiful letters to me, they were great letters.
Her personal connection has also borne fruit politically: Trump referred to the announced by Kim stop all nuclear and missile tests, even if critics behind it so far see little more than lip service.
That the affection for notorious about his martial threatening gestures "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - not everyone should be fussy, seemed quite aware of the US president.
In any case, he anticipated the anticipated criticism in his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so unpresistative.
He cared little for that, Trump explained, pointing his finger at the crowd: "I've always told you, it's so easy to be presidential."
But then there would not be 10,000 people crowding into this packed arena out there, but we would have only 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Well-attended, atmospheric and on top of it all spoiled by the sun: Very varied and with a good dash of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweilers city on Sunday dressed up.

Refugees saved with video from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees have used a cell phone video to highlight their catastrophic conditions in Libya, which has helped rescue them.
The group had shot in their cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July at mortal danger and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the France 24 Observers website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably would not have been able to return to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video he brought himself in his own life.
One of his comrades had been nearly beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homelands this year using the program, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional given the poor conditions in Libya.
From a call for help via mobile phone video, he had not heard so far.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.

At about 4:50 pm, the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the foyer of the first floor, she saw a man who fled immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher contacted the police who took the investigation.
Whether things or money were stolen, can not yet be said.
Description of offender: approx. 16 years old, black, very short hair, darker appearance, dark trousers, dark t-shirt.

Laschet urges the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne According to NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU), in his talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he called for the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations of the two countries are currently "overshadowed," said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This concerns above all arrest waves, the press and the religious freedom.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan "that if relations are to be normalized in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite".
According to Laschet, Lachet also referred to the cases of Germans who are in jail in Turkey.
He formulated the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then reiterated the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been temporarily transferred to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defense at the Cologne airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected this because of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to talk after the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in the United States: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump never tires of emphasizing the successes in the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington's concession.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government of the United Nations general dispute with its continuing sanctions to block negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
"The recent stalemate is that the US is building on coercive measures that are deadly for building confidence," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament would be unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way we can disarm ourselves first," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
That punitive measures could force North Korea to "kneel" was "a dream of people who do not know us."
However, in order to build confidence, his country had stopped his nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri pointed out.
However, the US had no "corresponding reactions", criticized the minister.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program, last year alone, the UN Security Council passed sanctions on the internationally isolated country three times.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing for strict sanctions at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on an approximation.
In June Trump hit North Korea's ruler Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang for talks on ending the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth club, the many visitors to the house of the open door HoT got nothing: White blankets and flower arrangements on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank the food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, head of the HoT, remembers.
We had our refrigerators already filled with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then came on the first day after the summer break, the nasty surprise: A power failure had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of service, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start over again: Although we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," said Westbuer.
And so everyone took part.
The result was impressive, the guests were thrilled.
"Chefs can not do any better either", a visitor praised impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or the guests were allowed to serve quiche, meatloaf or cake.
"It is really great what the children and young people have achieved," said pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen caused astonishment with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW state executive board
Out of frustration over criticism from their own ranks, the head of the Essen board, Jörg Sartor, has left his post in the state association.
Sartor had become known nationwide, because the Essen board had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He resigned in July as vice-chairman of the NRW panels, Sartor said the "World on Sunday".
Too many have fallen in the back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed to the dpa understanding for the decision of his longtime deputy.
The sharp criticism had taken Sartor.
"I can understand his step - there have been people who did not know exactly why the Essen board does that."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen board - "six days a week, nothing changes", so Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized in the "World on Sunday" again criticism of colleagues from other panels.
One should not pursue the approach, "without us starving people in the city".
It was up to the state to ensure that people did not starve to death.
At a congress of the panels on Friday in Berlin the Essener did not participate.
"I'm told too much sweet cuddling," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis that criticized me so much back then.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly a year after marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves on Saturday in Hamburg the Jawort.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we marry, then right". He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is budgetary spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesman for the Seeheimer circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the parliamentary debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals Kahrs had attracted attention on June 30, 2017 with an anger speech.
So he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to have "stumbled" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, referring to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.

Bankruptcy at Hertha: Obtained from reality: Bayern demanded against Ajax
The predicate unbeatable is gone: The defeat in Berlin wants the FC Bayern "not like it".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small power dip under new coach Niko Kovac should not increase for the Munich under any circumstances to the greater autumn low.
"One week ago we still had the impression that we are invincible.
Now we have a bit of reality, "said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a response for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us, knows that we are really annoyed and that's why we give gas on Tuesday.
For the first time since more than a year away scored no own goal, as at the same time the preseason two mandatory games in series without victory, the league leaders in the Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund for the time being.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti end of September 2017, but the record champions must be warned.
The FC Augsburg in the 1: 1 with its running-intensive man-on-man tactics and the Berlin through their playful pinpricks on the outside have delivered within three days equal to two blueprints, as the last overpowering appearing Bayern but crack.
"Those who know Bayern know that we will not put up with that and that we will do everything to make us successful again," said Kovac.
Otherwise, he dealt surprisingly softly with his losers in his native city and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only on the again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would make the first interim conclusion of his term nonetheless positive before the international break - otherwise the tone should probably be tightened.
So Kovac undertook before the second premier class appearance this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon, no extraordinary measures.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax, which defeated AEK Athens confidently with 3: 0, begins as planned.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke plain language.
The right-back acted as a warning in the role.
"I do not think that's all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we do not make the many opportunities and back mistakes," said the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh matchday of the previous season, Bayern were even behind with five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken over again with a one-point lead the top.
And so Kimmich evaluated with a wink at least positive that now the public debate over the supposedly unbeatable Bayern has come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the international.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in the line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany with grave allegations.
German Football Association President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the interpretation sovereignty in the long-running controversial topic Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, defended the head of the DFB Association line.
On early Sunday morning Özil personally sharply attacked Grindel announced in Mainz ZDF "sports studio" consequences of the cause.
"Since we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams, we have to draw very precise conclusions in the future, that something like that does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as a further integration representative.
At the same time, Grindel once again stated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had sharply denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they allowed me to be photographed with me in England, "said Erdogan on Saturday in the cathedral city.
Honestly speaking, as its president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who had risen to the German national team, were marginalized.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that in contrast to Özil after the World Cup affair, which had taken photos of the two had taken with Erdogan, "reasonably treated by the DFB" had felt.
At the same time, he announced that he would like to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - that will not work.
"I deeply regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We had to defend Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see any basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a consequence, in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration representative should now be appointed.
"If someone without a migrant background has a significant impact on society and football and says, 'The issue is important, we need to take care of it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where Integration must work, "said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair he wants to run again next year for the post of DFB President.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it gets," said Grindel.
Year old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg / Roedental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old has caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 13 clock.

"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, referring to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017 same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the adoption law.
Referendum in Macedonia started over new state name
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
About 1.8 million voters should decide whether their state in the future should be called North Macedonia.
On it exists because of its northern province of the same name the neighbor Greece.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may still only be removed with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland launches this Monday an electronic register for organ donors.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to provide their organs in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes will then be available from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs - as in Germany - may only be removed with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases a card is found at the crucial moment in possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"You then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very stressful," says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to save information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no register in which people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation -", she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or a family member objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church refuses.
14-year-old student is world champion in mental arithmetic
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in mental arithmetic.
He sat down at the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 competitors.
This was announced on Sunday by Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition.
16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the eldest a 74-year-old retiree from France, as chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
For example, previous assignments were: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, in which participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he keeps a ball in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was there two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms like super brain, genius or child prodigy, organizer Laue can do little.
"Mental arithmetic can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even arena-based competing competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, square root extraction from six-digit numbers.
In case of diversity calculation the candidates get surprise tasks, for which they have to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, the Germans had good chances, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often at an advantage because mental arithmetic is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods even in early childhood.
Urgent appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer screening
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows off her soulful and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point with this video on breast cancer and make strong for early detection.
It's about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings up without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands obscure her most intimate parts.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about breast cancer screening that can save lives.
Serena Williams herself died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia there were complications.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT blood clots were then discovered in Serena's lung.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans a significant expansion of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a draft law on the so-called "Symbols Law" in review.
This is intended to significantly increase the number of terrorist or comparable groups that are covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
For the first time, Ms. Holle will be shaking off her beds in the west next week: Polar cold air will reach Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the start of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to around 1,000 meters at high intensity, it was said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, fresh snow is to be expected above 2,000 meters with 20 to 40 centimeters.
On higher mountain pass roads (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlos Pass, Felbertauern, Grossglockner High Alpine Road), the road conditions are therefore wintry.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual kink care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein farmers can start with the annual kink care on Monday.
The "green ramparts", which are unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor state for about 200 years.
The tree and shrub hedges, which are up to five meters wide, are "forest substitutes" and for many animals and plants the last refuge.
Knicks connect habitats scattered as corridors, through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the managing director of the German Nature Conservation Union (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of a command of the Danish King Christian VI. in 1766, which ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundary and cattle fence, they also supplied the farmers firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name came from that time, "kink": By "bending" of the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, around 45,000 kilometers of hedgerows stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the impression of a wooded landscape rich in variety.
According to the NABU they are now used by about 7000 species as a replacement habitat.
In one kilometer of kink, up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the kink can only fulfill its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, it stunted to a sparse row of trees, which in addition to the biodiversity and the windbreaking effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the kink care may only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March.
Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about local situation
The local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and the tsunami in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND):
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes hit, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately started on the way back to Sulawesi.
That's when I arrived on Sunday morning because after a flight I had to drive for more than 20 hours because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can be flown in as well.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of World Vision has also been destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have housed other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills where they are still out for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
Even a prison was destroyed, the prisoners walk around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not been found yet and are missing.
How is the communication and information supply on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before that did not work and we only got information over the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people they do not know if they live or where they are because people were not at home during the earthquake, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have information about this?
We do not know the reasons, but when the all-clear came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was a misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is not an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, prepared for earthquakes?
But, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure collapsed, the earthquake hit a lot of people.

Biathlete Julian Eberhard targets World Cup medal
Biathlete Julian Eberhard was in the stomach for fourth place at the Olympics.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to catch up on the missed precious metal at the World Championships in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic Sprint of Pyeongchang the grasp near medal.
Seven tenths of a second were missing in the end on bronze.
"I deliberately took my time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in great shape, but it simply did not want to be.
All the more motivated is the Pinzgauer to catch up on the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to the constitution with a big event, to win something.
At some point you have to strike then.
The world championship track in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I've already taken the track to heart," he remembers with pleasure at his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics he celebrated in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN) the only single victory for Austria in the past World Cup winter.
With the season he ran in Oslo (NOR) in second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in turbo tempo
Time is extremely short and the number of scheduled interrogations is very limited.
With an FBI investigation in the turbo speed, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the gossip-thin majority for the controversial due to coercion judges candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has given investigators a deadline of Friday to investigate alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The recent turnaround in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's appeal for a culture war was sparked on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer launched furious ranting against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee was to pave the way for final confirmation by the arch-conservative judge at the US Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when, suddenly, Senator Jeff Flake, contrary to his original announcement, said he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described the heavy charges on Thursday as a "shit", initially refrained from further attacks against the women and spoke on the contrary of "happiness in misfortune".
In this way, final doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the democrats sharply at an election rally because they reject Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy".
Trump orders FBI investigation in Kavanaugh case
Also, the White House has narrowed the powers of the investigators extremely.
It will specifically investigate the known allegations of two women, not more, said a government official to the "Wall Street Journal": "They do not go on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile, installed in a "civil vehicle" radar unit of the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit is based on Monday, October 1, based on the Gartenstraße, according to city municipality.
There is also the Federal School Center.
The municipality also operates several permanently installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: It has felt the fear
Coaches Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - Meanwhile, it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in there.
And there were many corners and many balls in our box, "said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed.
After all, the Royal Blues had managed to seal the narrow 1-0 win against Rheinhessen over the course of time and thus the first victory of the season.
It could actually have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11th had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco security Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and from the pressing", played with increasing playing time obviously more and more the head a role.
Do not scoop a header monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours to me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give that out of their hands and therefore retreated ever further.
And defended against Mainz with a man and a mouse.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone of the heart," said Schöpf, who had it with his header hit an insignificant share: "I'm actually the worst header player in the Mannschafft".
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course, at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the initial phase and start fireworks," said Schalke's head coach.
The victory was important.
Finally we can enjoy a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played smart, calm and courageous, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest drawback of the afternoon: Royal Blue missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry about.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit twice the bar 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have been a dithering win," said Tedesco: "One has already felt the fear a bit".
So I'm glad we won.
So he was not the only Schalke.
Fischbachau: smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was unmistakable.
From around two kilometers away, a hiker in Leitzachtal observed a fire on Sunday around 1.30 pm.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - Police and fire brigade soon found out the cause: A stranger had set fire to garbage on a two-square-meter area at Gschwendner Berg.

Prof. Dr. Aladdin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them stands the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my mission for many years to bring interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates in organizing the evening with the "Cultural Policy" alliance.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very easily, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic intelligibly.
With lots of gestures, tangible numbers and one or two jokes, he brings the audience closer to one of the most contentious subjects: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at one table, migrants of the first generation at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to have a say.
That leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether one classifies oneself politically right or left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?", He emphasizes.
At first rather restrained, then more and more lively starts the discussion round.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration with students.
El-Mafaalani is standing, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not push his mind, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing lesson, he still has an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, intensively discussed further.

Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is obviously huge: Over 100 interested parties have applied to buy one of the properties in Landsham-South.
The municipality Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the housing estate Landsham-Süd on the open market.
This is reported by mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots of land that the community is offering on more favorable terms or prices - similar to the previous local model - has been completed.
A good 100 applications were received, according to Frick.
"Currently the documents are being reviewed", in terms of application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the Mayor of Plien, the goal was to have created the applicant ranking for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the local council.
After that, the award could be made.
A total of 50 plots for single and double dwellings will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family dwellings, each with an estimated eight residential units.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and paths are soon to be paved.
A single plot and two of the apartment blocks belong to a private individual, the rest of the community Pliening.
She sells the bulk on the open market, 20 plots in the socially responsible model.
The two apartment blocks of the community are to be built according to Frick as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments subsidized by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated, housing space for about 200 people has been created on the area of the new housing estate Landsham-Süd.
But that's not all: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, there is the start for the construction of a day care center.
It will house three kindergarten and three crèche groups as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is planned for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
Schalke's Naldo "great sport" also succeeds on the bench
For the third time in a row not in the starting XI: Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not sat in the Schalke starting line-up for the third time in a row, the understanding would have been great for many people, when the almost two-meter-tall Brazilian spoke the frustration of the soul would have.
But when the Schalke players gathered after the 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05 as usual in the center circle and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, all called for simplicity's sake Naldo, intervened and said ; "We have to thank, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who despite his renewed reservist existence had no grudge.
Probably Naldo, who was honored last season as the best Schalke, knows that he has not really gotten off the sidelines with his trainer - but, for good reason, gets a break.
A reason called "stress control".
It was not easy to tell him that
"It was not easy to tell him that, I'll tell you honestly," Tedesco said of the moment he'd told Naldo he was not in the starting lineup.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the club, "said Tedesco the step.
Naldo has played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can take a breath right now.
And that we all keep in the boat, "said Tedesco the rotation, which has recently caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself on the bench as a model team player.
The mood in Austria's industry accelerated its decline in August compared to the euro zone.
The PMI stood at 46.7 points, a 37-month low.
However, Austria still has the third best mood in Europe, behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday on its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the Eurozone PMI rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, putting the index below the 50-counter mark for the 13th consecutive month, indicating growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
Taillight were the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the sentiment barometer fell, but more slowly than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March, at 44.0 points.
"The slightly slower decline could mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But the industry - in any case in the third quarter - remains growth brake number one.
A speedy return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell more sharply than they had since November 2011.
That's why the companies cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
In China too, industrial production fell more sharply in August than initially assumed.
The sentiment barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing managers index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, warehousing and prices are recorded.
