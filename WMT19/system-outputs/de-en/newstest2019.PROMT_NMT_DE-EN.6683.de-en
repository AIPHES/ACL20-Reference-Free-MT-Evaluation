PKK Chief of Government now sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin is currently seeing no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on once you get into conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt the one or the other as that is laid down in his statement," Grindel told the "Bild-Zeitung" in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher."
Despite the now months-long debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed until some point in time that would be the case, "Grindel said.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the PKK team in July, also justifying him for not defending him against racist seizures during the World Cup.
The chief executive reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with the President of the German Federal Police and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build any pressure, but he knows it from football in such a way that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I find it a pity that this conversation hasn't materialized so far."
Linz: Garden hut burned in shrink species settlement
At 14.13, the Linz Vocational Fire Service was alerted to a fire into the Berne Court Trail.
Because a high voltage line leads directly over the shrink species settlement, danger was in arrears.
The Professional Fire Service departed and found the hut in full fire upon arrival.
The roof had to be removed virtually to the geese and incendiary rubble removed to an absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery fitted to the store at noon.
That might be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the largest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined - as does the cause of the fire.
However, he is likely to be significant, because the owner had many collector's items in his garden hut.
Angry mother vows: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open street
What did Lindsay Lohan just drive to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to strip the children of an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded ") has itself streamed live as she appears to want to strip the children of a family in Moscow.

For all this, she does not provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan can be heard watching in the video as she tracks the family further along the road.
Apparently she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems the obviously angry mother is enough.

Under tears, the actress then begs how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What has led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.

The detained and audited Audi chief executive Rupert So had announced in December 2017 that the taskforce would soon be disbanded.

Mertens now said: "In early July, we achieved an important stage goal in the delivery of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The taskforce had been formed in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the motorist made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board on Friday adjourned a decision on Stadler's future and wants to continue discussing this Tuesday.
Investigators accuse the Audi chief of allowing the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust levels after the exhaust industries were announced.
In doing so, he knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Sales Board Bram Schot manages the company as Commissioner Chief Executive.
Due to the switch to the new WLTP exhaust and consumption test standard, there are production failures at Audi, Schot told the "Zurich voice."
In principle, he sees a declining demand for biosusines such as the A6, A7, and A8 audio models, which are produced in-house Ulsulm.
"The segment in itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electric mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are 15,000 reservations already available.
Grindel aims at reelection - Lame has to go in the German Football Association praesidium

He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Theresa could become his successor as the chief executive officer.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President of the State, Recep Erdogan, the President of the State expressed a desire that in future a Federal Council without a migration background should become an integrated ambassador of the German Communist Party.
Currently, this office of native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic exercise, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If one has a clear impact on society and football without a migration background and says," the issue is important, that's where we have to take care, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our clubs on the ground where integration needs to work," said Grindel.

Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who have been reported to have experienced sexual assault themselves, confronted him in a lift en route to the committee meeting.
"You can also be happy to meet me at any time in a lift," Flake now said at the concert in New York to the audience.
Freedom of the press: Federal government defends journalist's oustment
Government spokesman have defended the oustment of a journalist from the press conference held by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President-in-Office-of-Office-of-the-House of the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In the Office of Culture, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had moved a T-shirt with the Turkish and German words "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the front row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, Seibert told the picture on Sunday.
It involved a disruption to the expiration of the press conference.
As a result of the journalist's action, there was strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
That's why he caused personal shooters to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Constitutional Office.
This applies entirely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, numerous journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or the support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership is making the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15 July. July 2016 responsible.
Some of the accused journalists are threatening several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not certain of the Turkish authorities: It was not until the beginning of September that Austrian journalist Max Ach was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the jailed journalists Meşale Tolu and
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but trials are still ongoing in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and handsome his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
There you have to look twice: Yeah, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht," produced by the German University of Applied Sciences, is well known for its humid conversations at the counter of the Hamburg Port Academy.
Host Ina Müller comes across some beer, some wine or even more high-profile drinks with her guests to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few firefighters also drink courage for mandatory organ deposits.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: Actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "Men's Hearts," Terror - Your Judgment "or" The Most Horrendous Day. "
But the Munich did not get a good trip to the high north.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely squeezed on it, eyes just two little slits left.
The bed selfie features a completely leaked florian David Fitz.
Yet he's not sick, he just has a powerful hangover.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - findings he has now gained: "Rule One: NEVER goes to Ina's night.
Rule Two: Never drinks the black sau.
And Spritz.
And the round of ovarian, which Ina slams by half three, let go as well.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted some tips to fight the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish broth or - presumably most purposefully - headache tablets.
Others simply amused the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
How Ina Müller survived the night-long Saufgelage is not known so far.
Since she has hosted the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has struggled with vandalism and indulgence
Entry into the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in the Red Cage Country in Treysa is difficult to spot and multiply.
Recipes against grassy vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Joking, cigarette kicks, rubbish and weed, unearthed shingles and now dismantled signs - for example, the entrance with seat group to the bike path on the Haaß Hill in Treysa has been presented since January.
For the sign object Railway cycle path in the Red Cage Country, a more than inescapable sight.
The topic employs members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a longer time, according to the Cycling Officer of the City of Ulrich Employees.
The problem had already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from moving the seat group to regularly emptying the waste bins and cleaning the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible other activities," says Employees.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also introduced the issue to the local advisory board.
Not only does the rubbish drive cyclists and residents around - the seat group is regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often noisy, but in the case of the vows it is also destroyed: The floor is torn out of the ground, the slab is squeezed, the signs are nodded around, the seat furniture is shrewd.
Volunteers would already have cleared up more often, tells German Cycling Club member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are just the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are angry that the car park at the Christmas Market in Treysa is the meeting place for Saufgelage.
"Along the entire cycle path there is clearly the focus here on the Haaß Hill," confirmed the cycling officer, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegthe town is opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it becomes really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly that puts the threshold significantly higher to trespassing on common good.
That would, however, require a police strike to pass in a timely manner.
In principle, adapt to the development of the Haaß Hill.
It must be made more attractive.
After all, one can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle.
Tourist marketing is still ready for sale.
Our competition is very high-quality compared to others in Germany, "the ADFC members said.
As an extremely critical hazard site, ADFC Member of the Board of Management of the European Parliament of Treysa estimates the situation in Asheröder Straße.
There is no swimming pool on the Haaß Hill.
With rain traffic, it may happen that cyclists must wait in the middle of the road between both sides of traffic flow, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Cultural Station: The "Kö of Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in collaboration.
To portray "D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Hiltrup City Offensive, in the "Music Panel for Large and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians."
A contest "with winking in the likeable Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family clash with coffee and cakes from the seals of the Cultural Railway Station.
Seven formations competed, from the one-man band to the great ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived in Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper star colours," three members and three generations of the Trthe and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally the Rike Weßarling.
This contest, District Mayor Joachim Schmidt stated, was a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other neighborhoods yet.
What did the texters see connected to?
The Hiltruper Lake and the market festival were often mentioned in the places.
Rolf Ihmig cut the choirs to the "Kö von Hiltrup" in his headlong song.
The cultural station was also recognized.
Time and time again it was about experiencing one another in these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short rebuilding breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or tips to her creating.
It was thus learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
From the sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann, she knew to report that he appeared at the University of Applied Sciences - at a major event held by the PKK with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has all over the world placed on
"It's not a question of winning," Mr have said.
In fact, all participants got a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
Still, there was something special for the jury's favourites - so others can hear their songs as well.
An entire CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup headmistress, particularly impressed with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "A very beautiful appearance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tzölle.
Like all of them, the children performed for the final once again - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Mr's said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to hiltrup, ingenuity of melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Brandenburg School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß of KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Economic Association, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the City Offensive.
The City Offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She rated the event a full success.
Everyone is "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" at the soon-to-be very full cultural station.
The Word Game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams sitting opposite each other.
For each page there is a viewing screen, in it four cards with keywords, which you cannot decipher - the old trick with the red slide - until you put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Cube.
4. Firmly".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted.
Because we should guess here not the terms, but codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the encryption.
He gets a code card, on which perhaps "3.4.2." stands.
In "Decrypto," the terms behind the secret film are not supposed to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice," feast "and" window "- in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and if possible the opposing team does not; Because that wins the match if he manages to crack the code twice.
The encoder thus notes and reads aloud: "Throwing" for the cubs, "lots" as opposed to Fest; Here, of course, something like "Party" would also be possible and "Prague" because he looked out at school and knows the window crash there.
So it continues round by lap, team by team.
While you don't know the terms of the opposite side - it can be better teamed up with any clue that the encryption there gives.
As mysterious as possible, but not too rotten the rewrites should be, otherwise one makes it needlessly difficult for his team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule specification.
The fellow players probably have to study it quite long and detailed until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the net makes it easier.
Yet those who have set off for the first time will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this undisclosable game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessor and genre primus "Codenames," which also stumps an agent's touch on a game less words, but is much better to play for in small groups.
And whoever is just about guessing and not winning points can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitlergruck and harms guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the State Opera twice the night from Saturday to Sunday.
It was only in the Upper City that he showed a passing police riot the Hitlergruß, and later he also fell into a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After being clearly alcoholic, he had to spend the night at the Free State of Applied Sciences in the Haftzelle.
In the sober state, he must then also face criminal prosecution for the use of plates of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig plant was home to the drawers
The railway operating plant in Pressig was the hub in Frankenwald for decades.
A piece of railway track ended in 1991.
"When buffers clung to buffers, you heard it all over Pressig," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and station.
That didn't stir up anyone.
That's when the brakes also calmed down and choked the carriages.
That was just a railroad.
Statements that make sense for Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railroad.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 meters of elevation, has its vertex in the forest in the city of Upper Austria.
To cope with this, train and drawers used to be needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Federal Office approved the construction of a railway operations workshop with 21 localities shed, apprentice workshop, chassis and railway master.
"The centerpiece was the hub, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," Says, an off-the-shelf historian and 47 years of professional seismic thugs.
The railway works plant Pressig, which was placed under the authority of the Railway Works Plant in 1968, also operated loks for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, out-of-town - Leheste, Stockheim - Sonneberg and-Nordhalben.
On 15 July. "Volksblatt" reported a staff stock of 160 men on July 1, 1950; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
Electrification of the 1939 line already minimized the need for train and drawers.
As of 1977, they were only needed for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 lows were still ranked in the month.
Parts of the farm were broken down in 1982, and the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is unfortunate that you did not consider better use of the site, including in puncto freight traffic."
Still on Pentecost 1989, the Railway Directorate Nuremberg celebrated a pompous Christmas Festival in Pressig on the anniversary of "50 Years of Electrification of Nuremberg."
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later the out.
On 1. June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, and the Pressig shunting station was history.
"The rangers and inhibitors completed the most difficult work in train transport," Dinkel recalls.
Any misdemeanor would have had fatal consequences.
Why the railway station has led Pressig-Rothenkirchen for the return of the hierarchy of both places and many other historical and topical pictures here there is in the infrankenPlus article.
Over-the-counter of China Open

House Lord Ernst Jürgen Schwarzenmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
As well as Mr Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
Somewhat surprisingly but a few days ago, Hahn announced his resignation.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his task in proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already played an active role in the selection of artists in the past and have co-created flyers.
This year, too, there is again a 70-cent special bribe brand designed by them on the occasion of Art & Enjoyment, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen," designed by Mr Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high popularity of the special exhibition.
For the musical framing, Max Marcus has been able to be won from Nuremberg.
While walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel Performance" formally challenges artistic imagination and ultimately expresses playfully.
They are artworks made of metal or ceramics, often embellished with colored accents.
Already at the entrance of the estate awaits the visitor on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, coloured, playfully fitted with 20 windbowers, 24 cane iron and 24 aluminum tubes as a soundpiece.
With the sun blowing through the bushwork in the background, the object acts fairytale and invites you to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate herself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K & G.

50 years MGV 68 nights: Singers celebrate 50. Birthday festive
1968 - this was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albanians also gave air to their displeasure at the time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to partake with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia," there should be no more Sangese life in the district.
It has since become a legend: At a bench in Tinnenbusch, they raised the MGV 68 Albacht from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated great in the "House of Encounter."
"It's going to be full today," said chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should keep right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanian singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
The traditional festival was back on time for the 50th anniversary.
An elegant ball it was asked for festive clothing before.
Guests were not sitting in the "House of Encounter" in rows of seats as usual, but were cosy at tables.
In the meantime, movement was complete: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the regulators and asked for the dance floor.
It is honorable that the singers of the MGV made 68 albums themselves sound the voice.
Happy songs were available for the occasion.
Almost already set: "As a day, as beautiful as today."
Suitable for the exquisite grape juice that many had before them, there was the "Rüdesthe Wine."
Alluding to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin name for "hops."
Once again, the chorus direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the Five who were in Tinnenbusch at the time, was sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said: 'He's got such an easy kind, it's a master achievement that he does. ' By the way, this time, not only men presented themselves with Bosnian.
The women's choir "Hohe C" also guest starred, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
After all, there was poetry art.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding sealing art.
There was also a large tombola.
A visit to the Allwetterzoo is to be financed by the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3. League Women: USC II Wins High-Class Derby Against
The fief marches.
Three games, three wins - USC Münster's reserve under auspices of Axel Büring can be found really well in League Three.
No trace of scare or fractures, the independents are doing their thing.
And this is really good in the 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against Stadtkonkurrent
"That wasn't glass clear, but we've already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately conceded to this: "This is a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied. " On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday celebration of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was played off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third set, guests had a set ball.
"If they bring that to the goal, a game like this can kick before," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC, with its routine forces, made everything clear and brought the full yield to the goal.
"We are all aware of who is on the other side in such a derby.
That doesn't break our neck.
I've seen phase-by-phase really good volleyball, "Annacker hadn't hung with the 0:3 - and promptly went over to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independents does not seem foreseeable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," Axel Büring says.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3. Liga has an incredibly good level.
This is not almost comparable to that of A-type volleyball. " To the fourth division, they don't want to turn their gaze down any more anyway.
Should the vest not be molested over the next few weeks, they will have to look up.
However, an initial balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven lots.

About her marriage to Hans of Borsody: Heath Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship," Heath Keller became a star.
Now she talks openly that the series may have had a complicit on her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of Chief Hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heath Keller (76) famous, but on 01.Januar 2018 she went off board forever.
The series, which made her star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That may have been a reason, too.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world alone with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues perceived me at eye level, "Keller tells me in conversation with the" Picture on Sunday. "
At first she was always just "the wife of Hans of Borsody," but that had changed with the "dream ship."
Because now the journalists only called Heath Keller.
"Whether he liked that so well, I don't know."
She considers it possible that her husband-in-law might well have been envious, but "like many men, Hans also shunned conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody "and he wanted my fears not to get to know my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've shifted, "as she continues to explain.
She always felt like she was "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman I was never in truth, even if I sometimes appeared cheeky and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever. "
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could also go wrong a second time."
The day before the official funeral, I sat howling in the dressing room and wanted to cancel everything.
Marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday dusty.
I've gone far too naive to love. "
The nightmarner, who regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ portfolio of Zurich, this time has ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our falter is not a moth, but a little light-eyed.
And the greyish glow into which a green carpet dipped in Lake Constance Square dazzles him over fee.
But it's a film festival where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the headlight.
So on this late Thursday night he torched over the square to briefly ease himself in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis."
This is called the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitation company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The need centre in the parterre of a new pavilion gives itself a lot of effort to scatter a luxurious ambience.
That evening, however, the Lord's Oasis stinks to heaven for any reason.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the road: Invited guests, who have just entertained at the best level in the cinema next door to the opening film "Green Book," celebrate the festival start every year with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: It is well known that the works shown are from the whole ground ball.
What do you have to do with an article about this festival to avoid falling into creepy advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The falter binds a knit around the filler, which has covered him with a good fee, and two bulky doorsteps actually wave him generously.
Inside, the loaded push, they dance to live music well after midnight or can be presented by DJ rhythms to which they scream each other, and flush down with Cüpli exquisite hammers.
In the delicatessen shop in Souterrain, oysters are waiting for sloping mints, next door the unparalleled raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut up, a chocolate fountain fooled.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves of fully exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The falter studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator."
Should that be two separate instructions, he blew himself in the dresscode.
But it's rather a conditional construction, and it certainly has saved lives.
In the housekeeping section on the upper floor, the immigration fee kicks a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye," matching the festival award.
This mix with which a capsule manufacturer presents does not necessarily receive the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been writing for that brand for years, isn't here that evening either.
But there is a face that is known to the observer, between local minority, cassables and kitchen items: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His lead actor is unlikely to be far.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with a soon sixty almost like a chorus boy, walks through the crowd.
He will not be attacked, he will not be made, at most he would be enraged.
For this reluctance, happy to be misunderstood, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dancers
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team's victory.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona appears to have lived well in his new native Mexico.
After a 2-0 win by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to cumbia rythms, as seen in a video already released on Saturday.
In the 15-seam clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow-colored jersey, fired by the players.
The Mexican second-grader had defeated the Leones Negros with 2:0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: Federal League 1: ASV Send after load minute bankruptcy "on the ground destroyed"
Swen Bieletzki, Coach of the Handball Department of the Federal Police Department of the Federal Republic of Germany, could hardly believe: "Such a bitter defeat." His protections were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - pleas - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT &Apos;S 2.
They had not played badly - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - over long phases, the Sendener.
Only the initial phase "we've been completely asleep," the Nazi Party coach angered.
Quickly, the house lords led with 8:1, even the early break-out, which was not frustrated at first.
"Then all of a sudden a ruck has gone through the team," then, for the second quarter of an hour, was summed up.
At the break, the backlog was just more than two goals.
Most notably, Sendens Best, Mr Hintze, met another time at the stage.
After the change, it got even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst equalised for 15:15, then the car changer almost carried through.
Four minutes before the penalty, the lead was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
The impartials intervened in what was happening.
It is usually not possible to find fault with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty, which was capped by Mr Mühlhoff, "was a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times by the end - while the decimated Nazi Party also failed in the last attack.
The boys have struggled great, standing well at the back too against seven men and repeatedly throwing on the empty goal.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now has to be a damn victory," the rest-of-it-all-served-out-of-the-back-of-the-house-in-the-way.
ASV gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), innkeeper (3), cooper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de pole (2).

Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his looming removal as head of the billionaire firm.
He and U.S. Stock Market Supervisor SEC contributed a legal dispute over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.

Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk had stated that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.

This would have valued Tesla as a whole at $72 billion.
Later, Musk rested back: Tesla remains on the stock market.
After the agreement, Tesla now has to find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee that oversees Musk's communications.

Surveys: 46% don't want Merkel as chancellor by 2021
After the crossroads of the past few weeks, the GroKo cemented several poll lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in an questioning - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD first overturned the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for Sunday's picture nationwide.
In the Opinion Research Institute's weekly survey, the AfD adds one counter to 17 per cent, the SPD surrenders a point compared to the previous week, landing at 16 per cent.
Also CDU and PKK lose a counter and only come to 27 percent.
This is the deepest value to date for the Union in Sunday's end.
The Greens reach 15 per cent, the left reach 11, and the NCB reach 10 per cent.
Were the federal election on Sunday, Emnid said government parties SPD, CDU and PKK would get only 43 percent of the vote together.
As a result, the grand coalition has currently lost the majority on Sunday's issue at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
Government parties consistently come to 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 federal election, they received 53.4 percent combined.
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: The AfD, in several polls second-strongest party, comes at 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach voting shares of 12.5 percent to 17 percent.
The left is at an average of 10 per cent, and at the end of the year at 9 per cent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the vote share.
But the backing for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 per cent of citizens still find Merkel to be the right person in the Savings Bank, as revealed by the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS.
Only one in two (50 per cent) currently want the big coalition to hold in three years until the next regular federal election, with 41 per cent in favour of a re-election.
A further poll released on Saturday had also seen significant loss of popularity for Merkel.
Divided, the Germans also assess whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
47 percent are in favour, according to Emnid, with 44 percent opposed.
As a result, 64 per cent of Union supporters would like to see a candidacy, 35 per cent would not.
Hang-out at Aldi: Price reduced to love glow
Is Aldi becoming Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of Tinder, there are no more romantic meeting stories - he should talk about Putenffleisch at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fastfood dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket almost emits an anachronistic romance as a meeting place for great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced putter meat, boxer short bargains at the waist table or the favourite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app is in a reputation for being less of a contact but rather a conclusive stock exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react, you don't get around the hot brei for a long time in the first news?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood lovestory potential has it when the love glow precedes an out-of-the-eyes-lost-and-found plot.
If the guy comes forward at the email address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de his bid, that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
For example, it is the author of this Annonce in a headquarters unknown to us that she will also find her dream husband, with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 per cent reduced organic coup meat."
For believing in the magic of analog meeting, she definitely earned her Happy End à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis

The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, so far can only be contained by vaccinations, as a press release says.
Football: Reus and Zorc call for calm for idols
More than a few years ago, the President of the University of Applied Sciences Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus called for an end to the public discussion of the form and fitness of Mario Götze.

That's not good for the boy.
And that doesn't do us well, "said the Götze-friendly Reus, after the 4-2 victory in

Football: District league: Researcher's Performance Of The Up-And-Coming Wolbeck Against SC Old-Age Rheine Makes Courage
There were moments in this still young season, there went to court with the Seine hard.
Wortkarg he gave himself, the coach of the Football District Club, was retiring first (internally) to make sense of the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
Meanwhile, it runs again around the Brandhovweg.
The 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine is a red bear.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen, "Fetsch praised his boys, searching each individual for the match to simply say" thank you "for so much opposition to the ambitious guests.
In doing so, the coach had to make a system conversion after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him, Luca Rehberg came - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly over into a 4-2-3-1 in which, in the front of the line, Mr Thewes waited for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his out (17), the entrenched Luca Rehberg (26) And Jan Schroer (38) Missed the lead.
Almost that would have weakened when the SCA struck out dangerously in front of the Wolbecker box two times in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbreicher in minute 41 - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be the champion of his specialist.
After the break, the STL cheekily took full control.
Thewes from 18 metres narrowly failed.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes on a Thewes admission.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch again missed a fresh cell course on the left.
As Old Rhine's Chris Naberbräumer in the 70th century. Minute Robin Westhues fumbled, there was an indirect free-kick for the placards 18 metres in front of the guest case.
The Foulte competed himself and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues' thing with the right slap struck at the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes left to get damn long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew in 80. Do not miss the leather in the handlebars.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin ('s seat) immediately pointed to the point.
He did not miss the gift (79).
Bange minutes had to pass Wolbeck in the closing stages before Geske finished in 87. Minute from 12 meters, after all, still had the winning score on the bag.
Might have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Beer mug), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Leipzig Frankfurt wins 4:1 against Hanover 96
Initial position: Four points after five days of play - that couldn't suffice coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hanover 96, Germany finally wanted to provide Frankfurt with the first home win.
Striker Ante Rebic, who was in the starting 11 for the first time after an injury, was expected to help.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also back after a scare injury and was expected to prevent the SGE from capping further goals by standards with his header strength.

Helicopters in Kottingenhof gecrasht
On landing, an accident occurred at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
A drama ensued around 14 a.m. on Sunday at the airfield in Kottingmore.
Turbulence occurred when a helicopter landed, as police confirmed to be up to 24.
The heli was captured by a wind gust, crawled onto the ground and came to an end sideways.
Immediately, police, rescue and fire department were conscripted.
With a large bid, the forces came to the accident site.
The ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one road accident.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to go home independently.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been resolved and are the subject of the investigation.
According to fire spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire that could be extinguished quickly.
Report from the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the boards were at deadline 1. September female, as evidenced by the report "The Power of Monoculture," which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was ahead of the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors move past them," said foundation executive Wiebke Ankthe.
In the United States, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male-occupied leadership teams - with few exceptions - are far from possible.
The backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented compared.
It's another corporate culture.
The slight increase in the share of women among German stockholders was also due solely to positive stimulus among companies in the Index of Medium-Sized Values (MDax).
While only 6.8 per cent of boards are female, according to Allbright data.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
The women's share has stagnated at the 30 business companies in recent years.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I'm sure that next year, the Gestapo companies will recruit consistent women again - in their own interests," Mr Ankthe said.
The only German Government and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that they would not continue to commit themselves, to increase the proportion of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture emerges from the Supervisory Boards: 1. September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than they were a year ago.
"Recruiting just as many women annually for the boards would have reached a 40 per cent share as early as 2023," the report says.

"Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.

Ferrari made 69,000 Euro operating profit in the first half of the year with each car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 Euros, Tesla and Bentley even put strong on each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices ranging from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros profit before interest and tax EBIT.

After blemishing out in the ligacup, Manchester United are now losing in the 7th as well. Round of Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1:3. The way of defeat is still likely to give talk.
Sensational was the scene in the 74th. Minute when the resuscitAted ant Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; Just three minutes after Marcus Rashford led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester's defenses remained standing, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to push the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative highlight of a previously insufficient performance over long distances.
The vegetable situation at Uniteds city rivals Manchester City is very different.
The Citizens, coached by Mourinhos great competitor Pep Guardiola, advanced to an approximate 2-0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.

VW core brand is missing: Paris car salon in sign of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in Frankfurt, Germany.
Paris - Officially no subject and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the wrestling of driving bans and retrofitting is unlikely to let go of German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they show their novelties from next week along with competition from around the world in the French capital.
Diesel doesn't really matter much anymore.
However, the possible exchange and follow-up offers for diesel owners in Germany, to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, are still likely to be an important issue at least behind the shiny scenes of the trade fair stocks.
A big name is missing in Paris: Although the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, it is not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have their first pure electric models, among other things: The Ingols' e-tron is expected to be launched at the end of the year, the 2019 Ebbs' EQC.
Officially, however, both have already been presented.
BMW's iNext is not expected to launch until 2021.
At the heart of Paris is the new 3s.
In total this year from 4 to 14. More than 250 exhibitors represented October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle builders as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th anniversary this year, will be held every two years in Frankfurt, Germany, every two years.
In 2016, well over a million visitors arrived.
At least 380 people have died in the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had magnitude 5.9, the second had magnitude 7.4.
Communication and transport links have been damaged, and enormous road traffic has been created.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke in across the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a feast.
Casualty figures are feared to still rise significantly.
The figures have only come from Palu so far.
However, many other municipalities are also affected - along Sulawesis's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate church service in Werdpfalz
Motorcycle pastor Frank So (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for the motorcyclists at the Peace Church in Eveking with a helper team on Sunday.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclist on Sunday.
After all, the graduation service for the choirs was on the program.
Frank is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-wheeler.
Between April and September, the traditional motorbike service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of a month at the House of Nordhelle.
The semesters traditionally celebrate the conclusion of the season at the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, around 150 bikers had come together on Sunday to commit an all but ordinary service.
As early as 10 o'clock, the dams had been spread up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the bikers' early lock was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a flawed currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummererbach, were also present.
The sermon held during the parish church service pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill arranged for the musical underwriting.
"Although the choirs prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill is more likely to beat poetic-quiet tones," said Parish Priest Frank.
This, too, was certainly a Novum yesterday in the history of the motorbike service.
Füchtheim's home club celebrates great festival: After apple comes the milk
And also on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She supplied her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
There was also a great deal of interest in Georg.
He had his apple press in the luggage and demonstrated his staunch viewers step by step the process from mature apple to apple juice.
Then, and when, the children were left with the children and had the apples filled in the big funnels.
With a little muscle power, a finely crushed mass became out of the apples.
Not many of the children have yet been able to imagine how this should become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step of work this late Friday afternoon.
Wrapped in moulds and wrapped by nets, Georg-Equipped stacked a little like crochet-looking apple pieces layer-by-layer on top of each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of the work no longer fell so hard.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the filler farmer also had ready-filled specialties.
Thus he opened his "treasure box" and presented the latest spring white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was accordingly large.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents got into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple press, but also discover the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Active in the funnel camouflage of former soldiers also engaged as part of the festival and invited to play short-lived games at some stations.
Also next year, the home club will offer an action day.
Then, however, Gregory Krützidt pointed out, the home house in the heart of the Spargeldorf will not be the place of what happened.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious due to the topic: After all, it will then go around the milk.
1:4 v Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season pleas: "Fuckin 'situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in succession, coach André Klöreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hanover 96 around and pledged them courage.
However, there was much positive to see before at the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences.
"It is a lousy situation, but one must come out there as a team", repeated 96-professional football player Pirmin Schwegler and pushed: 'That's disappointing, of course, because you always take a lot of one.'
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) To the conclusion, stand at the bottom with two counters and are a candidate in their current constitution.
Led by the surprising Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated the first season home win.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th round. Minute, Rebic (45 + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59) And Luka Jovic (89) Scored in front of 46,300 spectators the goals for the PKK Cup winner, who, after the successful general rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Rome, proposed himself to the midfield of the table by seven points.
Croatia's vice world champion Rebic was almost involved in any dangerous offensive action by the Hesse in his starting debut, and never to be gripped by Hannover's defence.
The striker, long beaten after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertivity why he is so valuable to the choirs.
As well as Rebic, Liverpool's outspoken Brazilian Allan was the first time in the Frankfurt's initial formation to begin swirling.
A header flattened onto the goal net by Lucas Torró (17) Brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien have been stopped in a strong position at the last moment by the 96 defence around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced short-term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the House Lords fell almost necessarily and totally deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a repulsed corner, with a header extending in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot up.
It was the first World Cup goal for the defending player taken in the summer by the French second division club AJ-erre.
And Frankfurt followed up before the break.
This time there fitted Haller on his storm partner Rebic who let himself no chance capably durchtankte and 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser.
In half-time, Hanover-Coach organ riders responded to the weak notion of his eleven, bringing two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and-of-the-Art Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony now played a bit more boldly forward, but ignited ideas remained until just before the end when, after all, the connection hit still succeeded.
The Hesse were much more efficient there.
After a narrow hour Rebic started a solo and then put across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest were only running for the Frankfurt against overpowered guests, even Jovic hit a minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party part
Despite cool temperatures, Würselen had a good mood at the City Hall in the city centre.
The Munich chief burgomaster Dieter Reiter created it before million audience by the opening of 185.
With two strokes in the last week, the President of the University of Applied Sciences.
Geisingen: Hostage Christians Celebrate Holy Cross Feast
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on 14 July. September or the Sunday after.
The celebration service takes place in the city church, then is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the Final Church.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shunned Christ, who dates back to the 30-Year War and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier, according to legend.
Blood then flowed from the gunshot wound.
From this developed a large pilgrimage to the shunned Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not built to this day, only the mooring room stands, the missing town hall is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, pastor Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly attended despite the importance to the Geisinger parish.
After the service the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the closing sling ended the ecclesiastical part of the Cross Festival.
For many years, the Catholic Church Choir has been inviting to the Catholic parish for the secular part of the festival.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food as well as a wide range of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish still offered guided tours around the City Church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmitt-Seger informed visitors, on behalf of the parish, of the damage to the facade, roof, the sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will move on to the next year.
After the rumor has been in place for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual alerts could be prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already in place a few years ago has grown, but more has also been identified, which has only been made possible by the detection by rumor.
The refrigeration works have been completed, before winter the natural stone work is still to be started and it is hoped that half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Point of View
The "Lebensshilfe Donau-Iller" (Living Aid for the Danube-Iller) opens up a new residential home for people with disabilities.
The fact that "a very special house" is now being handed over to its destination - that all those present agreed on the date of inauguration.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair users, who have been living in the "Lebensshilfe Donau-Iller" home for some time, rely on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, flure and doors, larger spaces and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first theses began around eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer's building was put on the test for the residents with handycap: "The house had come into the years and no longer contemporary in the endowment," Bader explained retrospectively.
In 2016, the choirs returned to tear down the house.
The new building should be made as friendly and bright as possible so that residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Living aid Danube-Iller opens new residential home
About 4.6 million euros, life support invested in the new building.
The Federal Office contributed 2.4 million euros, and the District of Lower Austria contributed 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both time and financially.
The Managing Director of Life Support, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The substrate between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof design was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and artisans had built a home with the many specifications, which allowed residents to experience the freedom to move without any foreign help.
Similarly, the Head of the Social Administration of the District of Lower Saxony, "The house is based on the special needs of its residents who need tools to be mobile."
In doing so, housing and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And continue: "The property in this situation is a real case of happiness because it is no longer to be acquired in today's situation."
In total, the new residential home in the District Street offers almost 1500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities divided among three housing groups.
The Life Support Executive Heinz is proud of the 11 full-time staff who are based on tariffs.
Germany: Faint complaining differences between East and West
Berlin - Prior to the Day of Unity, Deputy SPD Federal President-in-Office of the Federal Republic of Germany has appealed to all countrymen not to deal with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that pain after nearly 30 years of unity.
With these differences, we must not be satisfied, "the President-in-Office of Mecklenburg-Western Germany told Sunday's" Tagesspiegel. "
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions across the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than the people of West Germany, but received 15 per cent less salary.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after the German Unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this putty dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is said to smooth the wodges between the two koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has made South Korean president Moon Jae In two North Korean pungsan hunting dogs a gift.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, about a year old, reached their recipient as early as Thursday.
They thus passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to make it easier for the animals to "indulge."
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the National Cultural Property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship deal had been announced by the North at the third summit meeting this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
In doing so, both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Summer Olympics and to apply together to host the Olympics in 2032.
In the course of mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for nearly ten months in this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published, most of which answer this question to the past hundred years.
It is quite different from Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, in the magnificent "Bild buch" Austria, which was published on 1 July. Will be released on October.
New week, new opportunity for government
Back to work in kind - this is the unofficial motto for the Great Coalition's working week starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, the SPD and also from the PKK did not mantractively complain about the "return to work in kind."
That may have led so many artisans, doctors, cashikers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work in kind, but be it drum.
If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its mission - to govern - it should not now be stopped from doing so with debate.
Whether the Union and SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and blasts of the last few weeks will perhaps show Monday.
In the evening, the tips of government parties come together to form the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round on a regular basis to defuse conflict early; A lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, the diesel retrofitting and the Expert Labour Migration Act are on the agenda again.
PKK Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the duty of technical retrofitting of older diesel.
While a rapprochement has taken place over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and SPD are still far apart from the proposed law on migrant workers.
The SPD calls for a lead perspective for rejected asylum seekers working or training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the 'change of track' from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be controversy again among coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal and equal to the GroKo has joined forces, but three partners with some very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society drawn by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not advance.
In order to be constructive, however, dispute must not be exchanged again for partisan reasons on the question of being or non-being.
This is still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and SPD should argue - but always look at the reality of the lives of the people.
What is feasible and benefits many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the gauge change question can be clarified in a pragmatic way - thus regaining confidence.
This is what the People's Parties must fight for now.
Fungus checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister Targeted
Does the Minister of Labour violate the applicable service law?
Mr Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" their legists would have worked on social security reform, an extraordinary social minister reported when presenting selfish two weeks ago.
In the case of List Fungus-Mandatarin Ebert Holzinger, the statement by Mr Hartinger-Klein (German Civil Code) meets with surprise - it now brings the matter to Parliament via request.
She assumes "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm at the use of her team and not to announce any violations of applicable service law before ongoing cameras."
Still, she now has questions to be able to "acquit Har ­ tinger of any suspicion."
Police tear up a street in search of women's suffering
Marxgrün - For a long time, the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, Steben has been dug on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The line is still closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was preceded by the fact that investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to restrict the relevant site to a few meters along with his guide in several times.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian Conservation Agency in the field of the said road piece.
For more than a year, Public Prosecutor and Criminal Police Court have been handling the missing case.
A Christmas market has repeatedly been locked at Marxgrün and investigated with sonar equipment because investigators suspect that Heike's body may have been buried here as part of the state road's redevelopment 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Buckles in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is taking place for the first time.
But tie-ups already occur.
Separatists have not forgotten the fall 2017 police operation.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of the 1st century. Clashes between separatists and police occurred in central Barcelona on October 1, 2017.
Catalan security forces were handed colour powder by independence supporters, among other things, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and Civil Guard.
Some 3000 officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honor their colleagues with a rally, who were in use last year in the referendum classified as illegal at polling stations.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also occurred at the time.
Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central government security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the around 6000 separatists would then have tried with force to break through the police chain, throwing officers, among other things, with paint bags and eggs.
Six people were arrested, and 24 others were slightly injured, citing authorities.
On Monday, the independence referendum is taking place for the first time.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under forced administration in the fall of 2017.
Then-regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also sat down abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, continue to be detained.
In December, New Year's Eve had been held in the region of Lower Austria.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of Catalans.
Football: Brandenburg Westphalia: Gathered treachlessness: FC GüterThe Club of The People's Party and the German Football Club Ahlen are separated torless
Red and white Ahlen continues to step in place.
It was also only enough to make a 0-0 draw at FC Güterthe club.
The final light and third-last dismissed them in front of 438 spectators at the Heidewaldstadion as assembled impunity.
The first half was easily manageable by the entertainment factor.
For this reason, anyone who wanted to get a beer or a Christmas sausage could do this without worry.
There was no risk of missing a torchance, because there were virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) goal of the entire match, freight lohs drew Nick Flock in the 28th round. Minute in charge.
The best - and, in principle, the only real - possibility had the Ahlener, when Cihan was forced into a parade by FCG goalkeeper FrederIc gerling after 32 minutes with a shot from the upper limit.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action consisted of an early change.
Striker Lars was forced to be replaced due to injury, and Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th. Minute Sebastian Mützel took aim from 18 meters just above the enclosure and after an hour the goods loher also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a balloting of Matthew Wieckowicz, it went fix.
The speedy contender about Sinan Aygün "crowded" Nick Flock (62.) With a however lazy shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also put on a header from Wieckowicz (66) After a corner ball by former axeman Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, bringing first-time And a little later, Enes out for Sebastian Mützel (70).
It worked out - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahlener did not materialize.
It wasn't until 91. Minute had the last chance, but it didn't bring in anything.
Angelo Daut sought to distinguish the positive: "I like that we played to zero." But unfortunately, the zero also stood at the front.
"This time we were not as torrential as we were against Holzwickede and that even though our opponent had no desire to play with us here," Sting's interim coach conceded.
Offensively, "everything plotted so much" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
At any rate, I didn't feel like we could get an opposite gate, "Daut said.
To his suffering, however, one did not feel, as a spectator, as if his team could shoot a goal.
For that, the notion was too meagre.
Recksfeld Harvest Bank Market: Luckily there are enough chalk
This is something that is pleased to be done by Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and at the Reckefeld Table Issuing Site, for which these donations are intended.
The nursery insurance companies: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld as well."
At the opening, the sky was brightly blue, while the space was still a little empty, but that should change over the course of the day.
Since: "Here it's so beautifully sociable, that's why we're here today," a visitor said.
Organiser of the festival Franz Josef Holehaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkthe outfit as always with a regular pinch of humour.
For the couple Brockmann, who were actually to be weighed up against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in the short term.
The University of Applied Sciences (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become sick.
But there's enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" could not be taken to talk musically about the increasing number of visitors.
That was so good that some folk songs were sung along at later hour.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer was delighted.
Mayor Peter Vennthe was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased with the many active people with their stands, including mostly clubs.
"Actually, there shouldn't be anything like a table at all," he nevertheless pleaded for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those in use at the stands and also included the other festivities found in September and the "cleanup" action.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful touch - here is something going on.
Then, the brokerage factory was taken off by Georg Trotr and for the help of the Fire Brigade and taken to the Winter Quarter.
Many stands have been worked for the physical well-being.
Everything was to be had from sweet to savoury.
Stefan Hagemenhof, who has lived in Reckenfeld for only a year, became creative at his decupation saw.
Veneer work, beer lid with Reckhler motifs and a lot more he had on offer.
A specialty offered three Reckenfeld Imker: "Recksfeld Honig," brought by Maria-Theresa Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Busch schlüter.
The latter still has a specialty.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access again and again, so well tasted the cake.
It is the sociability that allowed visitors to stay for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrications with local political message: No successful advertising for skatesystem
In Lengerich, unknown people have hardly promoted the construction of a skatetrack.
There are suitable lubrications in several places, says Jürgen Kohne of the City Council at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with police for property damage.
In large letters, on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall among others, the three words "Skatetters for Lengerich!" read.
Michael, manager of the hall, reports that even after the trade fair on 19 July. September a corresponding letter was discovered on the advertising sign at the stairway to the Gempt bistro.
Since the short message in turn appeared to have been left "only" with a edding, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, however, that stood there again, this time sprawled up," said Mr-Mann.
It assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given to this particular case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the table.
If the skatetrain system is built, it is also intended to be made possible by sponsors.
We already have commitments, explains the City Department of School, Sport and Culture, without mentioning names.
Well possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the shrewd table.
For years local policy and administration have been dealing with the subject of skatetrain.
After the old one was dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative site began after some time.
The Council eventually advocated the fire parking lot by majority.

Shortfall in air traffic control is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic accident in the summer, German air traffic controllers do not see any signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we've had wind, 2019 we're going to have strong winds and then the storm is coming," the head of the Air Traffic Control Union, Matthias Customers, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit on 5 July. October in Hamburg.
One important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known staff shortages in European air traffic controls, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new Lotsen lasts four to five years," the unionist said.
The market for fully trained Lotsen is vacant throughout Europe.
In central Karlsruhe alone to monitor upper German airspace, around a hundred people were missing.
It was again criticised that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives from the federal, state, air traffic control, airlines and airports come together on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional working compaction and overtime, that won't go without us," explained GdF's chief executive, who has many members at the federal German Air Traffic Control Company.
It was once again the responsibility of the EU Commission for the Lotsen-Misere.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 had been far too low.
The resulting cost requirements and staff savings in national air traffic controls are now fully linked to the operational business.
By calling on Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (PKK) to stand up in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut off the air even further" to air controls.
At present, the EU guidelines would be voted on by 2024 and further tightening should be feared.
The EU is facing constant lobby pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves over the last couple of years, &Quot; said.
He hopes the high cost of delay at airlines initiated a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to improving the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) provided a "coherent training and future pact," has said.
The previously announced intake of 120 Lotsenschüler per year over the next five years was just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
This is not yet linked to the necessary staff building.

Barcelona: Violence in demos of police officers and Catalan independence supporters.
There have been violent clashes with numerous injured people in two timely demonstrations by Spanish police officers and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona.
According to city authorities, about 3000 police officers gathered from across Spain on Saturday, as well as about 6000 independence supporters demonstrated.
Catalan police tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a large bid.
However, according to the Federal Council, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier.
They would have attacked officials with paint and throwing shots.
Rankings were reported to have also existed between participants in the various protest trains.
According to rescuers, 24 people were injured.
Police reported there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
Police officers, with their demonstration, had wanted to pay tribute to colleagues who opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia banned by the Spanish central government almost exactly a year ago.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and Guardia Civil feel it is unfair for Catalan and Basque police officers to earn significantly more than they do.
The protesters felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" 55-year-old Catalan disciple Manel Perez asked AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they twisted us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who have only done their duty last year: Defending the law, "he said.
But the demonstration is in favour of enforcing our rights and we're doing it in Barcelona because that's a big European city and there's more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the police officer assured.

Football: Juve coach praises for top spot: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game this evening along with half the hour of Valencia," praising juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record-breaking 3:1 (1:1) win against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive trapped star was the crucial man in the important match against the pursuer even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game through the hit of Dries Mertens (10) after the early backlog. Minute) and hung off the most annoying traitor for now.
The goalkeeper, founded by Real Madrid, first set up former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, with a double pack (26/49) Provided leadership.
And Ronaldo also did the preliminary work to hit defence boss Leonardo Bonucci (76) after a corner by header, who only had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," the coach praised.
Yet Allegri, of course, also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best juve goalscorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With Ronaldo's purchase for more than €100 million, Juventus's over-power seems to be becoming even more compelling.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six counter lead over Naples.
The scale of the table, coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Schmid, was not impeccable against Turin.
But at the latest after the reference of Mario Rui (58.) Was the top spot decided.
The Portuguese had to get off the pitch with yellow-red after entering too hard against Paulo Dybala.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turiner Coach.
This is where Emre Can was allowed to feel.
The German National Council prevailed at Juve.
The professional, taken by Liverpool, was in charge of all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Rotterdam League match against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the Turiner's 2-0 win and is banned for Tuesday's home game against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes its name
With a particularly bizarre performance, rapper Kanye West has garnered attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" at the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral-water costume ensured first-party theatre and question marks among viewers.

In an interview with radio station KRRL, the artist had stated that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think" Ye "is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means" you, "the rapper said.
Football: University of Applied Sciences A1 Münster: Finally!

Hoetmars coach Averhage made no mistake of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was simply more graceful, we've put him in trouble as best as ever. " Accordingly thinly the list of the Hoetmarer shot possibilities reads.
Grade two goals in 90 minutes, rarely making games positive.
Football League A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendup with 0:2 (0:1) photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG, too, had only two options in the first passage, but the first one used MaIk from a pointed angle to the early lead (7th).
In the 43rd. Minute could have been increased, but after great preliminary work he negotiated freely.
The hosts only had a double option when, first of all, Moritz Höne failed on goalkeeper Joe's shoemaker and found his champion in the postseason Jan Blome in the broadcast mayor Keeper as well.
After the break, guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Mehmemann (69) I forgot.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - could also not be used for the guests (75).
The match was decided (81).

Football: University of Applied Sciences in Münster: Spectacle football in nightmare respect: The 3:4 is the subject of Concordia at the Alberthe University of Applied Sciences
"That's when I don't know what to think about it," he ranked in words.
"We didn't get access to them at all." With them he probably meant the wing cutter with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green-and-whites who came across with collective offensive rank.
He could laugh anyway: "A dirty victory," he said, twirling cheekily, drawing from His players, on the other hand, was to note the relief that they had pulled themselves out of the affair by three points.
Well-noted, after a duel of two teams, one of which, i.e., Albacht, plays for the championship and the other, Alberthe, fights for the Free State.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach was looking back at the 90 minutes that were behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"How we come back after the 0:2, how we think about the entire season against one of the league's top teams against it, that was really phenomenal already."
All the more bitterly it emerges that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top goalkeeper Lars Zymner brought the hosts with his 12. Season hit in charge (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He put the 2:0 on the left hand side as a model for Aldi Freuning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take out a player like that completely.
"That was already madness what he did," Ebert acknowledged the opponent's quality enviably.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own elf made the equaliser: McGill's free-kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long goal (45).
After the side change, it was McGill again who scored the equaliser (59).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-charged game.
Nübel shoved Albacht again (64th), just five minutes later equalling Patrick Horstmann (69th).
Despite being outnumbered, Alberthe no longer managed to score the last Concordia hit (80.) To re-confer.
We now need to focus our full focus on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we've got to win now," Ebert said.
Albersloh: Braces mountain - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, to the mills - innkeeper (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).

The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France's president Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he wants to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Mehmff, the term was too short: As president, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Mehmff was a guest there.
Thus, when he proudly said: "All the federal presidents and chancellor were already with us." That celebrities keep appearing at the Academy at Tutzing Castle, but was also an issue when presenting the annual program.

Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Brandenburg News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday night in the Hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret reader, Teubner presided over gender understanding, not only with humour and heart warmth for the (felt) woman undden (felt) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used her and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
This is, on the one hand, the male saving ring partner, who sometimes speaks up until the end of the sentence, on the other hand, a true pianist: So congenial harmonically accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely as it matched the red thread of the evening.
That's when Teubner had brought in a paradox: The satisfaction with the man comes when he has a partner, but he does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates selfish: What would have unfolded from composing Mozart, would "the Nannthe" have unraveled open the door?
Thus, Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O head full of blood and wounds" into the "Song of Death," and from Mozart g minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers belong to Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the Chansonette.
But the chairman, Heidemarie Markthe, did not allow himself to take an additional thank you.
She had the idea of indulging the duo in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt, as well as one in Wolbeck.

The women's electors had problems, especially with third-team player have-been-a-half-year-Old Stallmann, who alone marked ten hits.
'Actually I was well satisfied with the defence, only one player has made too many goals.
We didn't get to grips with them, "ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu said.
But he was more annoyed by the many opportunities left out.
The concentricity in completion left his team missing this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end behind a backlog, lying at the break at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45.) behind.
It was only towards the end that the wider bank of female hosts made itself decisively apparent.

Internationally: Turkish Municipality: Mosque opening as missed chance
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the major Dithe mosque in Cologne.

Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of sidelining with top German politicians to underline Muslims' affiliation with Germany, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu lamented.
The wide-ranging exclusion of the German public has encouraged "many reservations."

Almost on the day exactly, it's been a year since we first performed a folktreff.
Meanwhile, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln, "is pleased to be the chairman of the Nottulner Home Association.
I would not have thought that our folktreff would be so fast in Nottuln.
Whether it's Storm Chief of State in January or heatwave in July, the official's camouflage room was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next folktreff is, as always, a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sea songs, folksongs, evergreens and old thugs," tells Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites friendly musicians to Nottuln.

From pure fruit construction to ecology
With a gala at the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125 years of existence of the District Office for Horticulture and Land Maintenance was celebrated.
On 29 July. September 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Verein Haus, the last founding impulses for the District Association for Horticulture and State Maintenance were set, and exactly 125 years later, he celebrated a major anniversary in the Kulmbacher University of Applied Sciences on Saturday night.
On the other hand, he was called another: He was raised from baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893 as a "District Fruit Building Association of the City of Upper Austria and Land."
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit-growing, no one thought about flowers and horticulture at the time.
"At that time, in the epoch of Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of elites," said Chalk Caregive Caretaker-Caretaker-of-the-World in his feast lecture.
Fruit trees were intended to sow long-distance roads, and so-called industrial gardens were laid out in schools.
The fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Upper Austria, which comprise nearly 7000 members.
But with that, the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Nature-related horticulture, biological plant protection, village embellishment and nutrition play an equally important role as conveying knowledge, a healthy diet and the energy transition.
The various tasks of a horticultural association were demonstrated by the members of the Hutschenburg youth group "Maulwerfen" entertaining onstage.
"The University of Applied Sciences is urgently necessary, especially in the digital age," said the County Chairman-in-Office. Also, OB Henry Schramm stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The chestnut collection was a huge thing for us children, I doubt you can collect much joy with Smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees for the anniversary, along with councillor Klaus Peter, together.
"Where they are supposed to stand, the county association decides," said the founder of the city, and highlighted the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The county association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district left no doubt on that either county executive and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with an image lecture through the long history of the county district and reported, among other things, the need for post-war self-care.
Formerly everything came out of the garden, for winter it was ingested.
However, in the late 50s the utility garden turned towards an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has stock, it has been there before us and we have to focus on it," the specialist argued for fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is the incentive for the horticultural associations not to let go so that our home remains beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens to our associations, added the President of the Bavarian State Association, Magdalena Vaitl.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, that's what we owe to our children and grandchildren," Chairman of the Festival concluded, which was ceremonially framed by the tower blanks of Thurnau Music Club.

The politician had been attacked on the open road during a campaign event in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "The Not") had called, above all, women's associations for protests against the ex-military.
Also in the social networks, the associations against Bolsonaros made racist and women-respecting statements mobile.
Several thousand protesters were expected in the São Paulo Economic Militia.
In the capital, Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally by Brazilian Workers' Party (PT) presidential candidate Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and therefore is not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil will be held on 7 July. October.
As ex-mayor of the millionth city of São Paulo, Haddad has been far behind far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls so far.
While the "Trump Brazil" has long been involved in political operations, it recently presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of the election, there will be on 28 July. October a snap election.
Observers assume Bolsonaro will not emerge from this successfully - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known for hovering against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He keeps shocking with verbal derailments.
Another time, he said the supporters of Lula's left-wing Workers' Party should be shot.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer ,-turned-producer-turned--Jeppesen, announced on Larsen's website.
At the death bed Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin ', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 70s.
Her songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.

He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.

The leader also recalled that monarchy opponent Larsen in 2010 at 70. Birthday of the Danish Queen. Had occurred.
Rock night at the shoe factory: Volume at press air collector level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert night with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand," Tiger Bonesaw "and" The Gestapo "alone suggest such a rewrite of the rousing live music experience on Saturday night in the hall of the Civic Centre shoe factory: Hardrock is simple of three bands that are friendly with each other.
After the sound check and just before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No trace of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oenhof - with their bands loudly excite the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows to convince to start the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces of his own feather and the soon-to-be CD.
In front of the stage, the performance is danced to the band's vocal and reprinting interplay.
Obschon's "encore" calls cannot be overheard, then "Tiger Bonesaw" leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand."
The fact that Hardrock is not the same as Hardrock, is demonstrated in the process by guitarist have been recorded as a guitarist, and Golo Meierhenrich, on bass, and drummer Kai Trotscher, with their alternative, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "Tigers" High Energy Rock, "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to guitar rock.
Not only the colourful, simply ballasted "Take Me Home" emerges from changing melodic passages to the guitar-lashing rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, since its inception in 2005, the quartet "The Gestapo" has gained special notoriety.
Full of agility, the band will present their hardrock on Saturday.
That "The Gestapo" has special stage experience with its performances in front of very large audiences - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - is obvious and unobtrusive.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets very own accents in conjunction with the band at the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
With regard to the sound that was even higher than before, guitarist-turned-guitarist Over-the-Top provides a reverberated solo at the time, running through the audience.
A certain volume of sound is, of course, part of this at such a hardrock concert: At the "Mint Mosquito" - Rocknacht, according to information from the mixed-panel team, the three-part concert of "Here We Stand," Tiger Bonesaw "and" The Elled "is about 98 decider.
This is, for example, at the press air collection level, but is still well below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitlad," which "The Gestapo" points out on its website.
Ear-believer 120 decider in nozzle-drive strength as usual with the annual Metal-Stelldichein in the north of the Republic, however, the Ahlener audience does not need at this rock night.
After just under four hours, the three bands of the harder, rousing gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, most of them in the transmitted sense, can end up saying.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of visitors.

Trump blasts Kim: "And then we fell in love"
That the US President of North Korea's leader Kim is well-intentioned despite nuclear crisis is no secret.
Now, however, Trump has made a regular declaration of love to his colleague.
She also has to do with Kim's "gorgeous letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has become aware of a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a long-distance relationship.
In general, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
Before supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tenuous words for the half-as-old spross of ruling syndrome from Pyongyang, although the one in wrestling around North Korea's nuclear disarmament proves quite faint brow.
"I was crisp, so was he, and between us it went back and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not just the conversations with Kim would have caused his heart to melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Her personal connection also bore political fruit: Trump referred to the halt to all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics have seen little more than lip knowledge behind it so far.
That the affection for whether his Martian threatening sign infamous "Rocket Man" - according to Trump's nickname for Kim - should not be sacred to anyone seemed well aware of the US president.
In any event, he was immediately anticipating the expected criticism of this in his appearance in a major sports hall of the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How horrible, how horrible is that?
That's so imprecise.
However, he did not care for that cordially, Trump explained, and afterwards directed his index finger at the crowd: 'I've always told you guys it's so easy to be president.'
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this prone-filled arena, but we'd only have 200 people standing outside.

Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed to their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya using a mobile phone video, allowing their rescue.
The group had shot and spread the recording in their cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July amid danger of life.
"They refuse to send us back," one man said in the video message.
We're suffering here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the France 24 Delegates website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually flown out to Nigeria in late August.
"Without the video, we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in an attempt to enter Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video, he put himself in danger of life, according to his own statement.
One of his associates was nearly beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
Generally speaking, the conditions of detention were disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their home this year using the program, the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo, said.
The case of Nigerians now rescued is not exceptional with regard to the poor prison conditions in Libya.
However, he has not heard of an aid profession via mobile phone video so far.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in Libyan refugee camps as being humane.
The North African state, dominated to much of militias, is the main transit country for migrants en route from Africa to Europe.

German was trapped in his own car for days

State elections remind rule of law in Turkey
Cologne North Rhine-Westphalia Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has sent a reminder in the conversation with the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan according to own information to rule of law in Turkey.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Mr have said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns, above all, the waves of arrest, the freedom of the press and the freedom of religion.
He therefore "made it clear at Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that rule of law is a very important prerequisite for that."
In Germany, Germany also referred to the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport had been moved in the short term to a flight readiness building of the Federal Ministry of Defence.
Originally it had been scheduled to take place at Schloss Wahn - but that had been rejected by the castle owners in political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to travel to the opening of the Dithe Mosque in Cologne after the conversation.
Laschet had called off a common appearance in the building.
But he said: "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of trust in the US: North Korea makes demand for disarmament
While President Trump doesn't get tired of stressing the successes in negotiations on denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime represents the circumstances more sober.
Secretary of State Ri calls for Washington to come forward.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government at the UN general debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
"The latest deadlock therefore comes that the U.S. is building on coercive measures that are deadly to confidence-building," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way that we are the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
That punitive measures could force North Korea on the "knees" is "a wishful dream of people who don't know us."
To build confidence, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri highlighted.
However, there have been no "corresponding reactions" from the US side to this, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council had decided on sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo complained to the United Nations in recent days about strict compliance with the punitive measures.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump had first met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit meeting with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is set to travel to Pyongyang again for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
That they were actually in a youth meeting, of which the many visitors of the House of Open Door HoT got nothing with them: White blankets and flower jewelry on the tables and a large buffet waited for guests after the harvest tank service.
The young people of the HoT had the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was funded by donations from the community, for which the youngsters wanted to thank themselves with the food.
In doing so, the start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as the head of the HoT, the director of Westbuer, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators already before the summer break prall with food and ingredients and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: A power outage had put the huge, two-part fridge out of service, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from the front: While we got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, the kids and teenagers wanted to make it on their own, "Westbuer said.
And that's how everyone packed up.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"Better can't cook it either," one visitor praised, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," said pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen, with card posts and other pieces of art, caused amazement.
Jürgen Sator leaves the National Board of Management of the Board of Management
In frustration of criticism from their own ranks, the head of the Essener Table, Mr Sartor, has given his post in the Federal Council.
Sartor had become well known nationwide because the Essen Table Office had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice-chief of the Nazi League of Applied Sciences, Sartor told the "World on Sunday."
I've fallen too many in my back.
The boss of the boards-land association of North Rhine-Westphalia, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed understanding for the decision of his long-standing deputy compared with the DPA.
The sharp criticism was taken by Sartor.
'I can see his move - there have been people who didn't know exactly why the Essen table is doing that.'
Sartor, however, is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, there's no change in that," according to Mr Sartor.
Sartor in turn criticized criticism of colleagues from other media reports in the "World on Sunday."
One should not take the approach of "starving without us the people of the city."
It is up to the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not attend a congress of the Christmas market in Berlin on Friday.
"That's where I'm told too much sweet schmus," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis who were so critical of me at the time.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly a year after the marriage came into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the Jawort on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come true to her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, right." He had been dating his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman for the SPD Federal Council and one of the speakers of the Seehenburg Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the final debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had died on 30 July. June 2017 with a whim speech excitedly excited.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "hijacking" on the issue.
"This was your Schabowski moment," he said, in reference to the accidental proclamation of the East German border opening by Mr Schabowski.
Since 1. October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.

Luckily, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to take advantage of again.

The burglars guessed that the residents were not home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them to take flight without prey.

Complaints at the University of Applied Sciences: Created by reality: Bayern claimed against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: Defeat in Berlin wants Bayern "not to be liked."
The next two classics against Ajax and Poznań now determine the first intermediate term for Niko Kovac's tenure.
The first small power source under the new coach Niko Kovac is not expected to increase to the greater autumn depth for the Munich.
'A week ago you still had the impression we're invincible.
Now a bit of the reality has gained us, "Thomas Müller conceded after the deserved 0-2 defeat at-play of the German Football League and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this is really annoying for us and that is why we are giving gas towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year no own goal was scored outside, as at the same time of the previous season two mandatory games in series without victory, the table lead in the football Bundesliga lost to Dortmund for the time being.
While the overall situation has long not been as dramatic as at the final stage of the failed Carlo staff at the end of September 2017, the record-breaking champion needs to be warned.
FC Augsburg have delivered two blueprints within three days in 1:1 with their running-intensive man-against-man tactics and the Berliner through their playful coniferous stitches across the outside, such as the last-to-be-overpowered Bayern.
"Those who know Bayern know that we don't let ourselves like this and we will do everything we can to make us succeed again," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, however, he handled with his losers in his birthplace surprisingly gently, shoving his first defeat as Munich coach merely to the once again flawed handling of chances.
A victory against Amsterdam and on Saturday's final match would nevertheless make the first intermediate season of his tenure positive before the break of the country - otherwise the tone is likely to worsen.
For example, Kovac did not take exceptional action before this season's second class appearance after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax, which had also forced the start of AEK Athens with 3:0, will begin.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As was the case after the lost final of the cup against the German Cup in Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua for the first part spoke in particular.
The right-wing defender appeared in the role as Mahner.
"I don't think this is all bad luck, we have to work it out again, too, because we don't make the variety of chances and make the mistakes at the back," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bayern were even five counts behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with a point of lead.
And so, with an eye-popping eye-to-eye I valued at least positive that the public debate around the previously unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yeah, that's good before," the head of state said.
It's good for the league before.
German Football Association boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack from Erdogan to Grindel
With serious allegations, the Turkish Federal Police of Erdogan denounces an exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
The President of the European People's Party (Christian Democratic Party), President of the European Parliament, sees mistakes, but defends the rule of law.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On a variety of stages, Mr Tayyip Erdogan and Mr Over-the-Counter fought for the interpretation of the long-term issue of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish Federal Office in Cologne, Germany, strongly criticized the handling of the former World Champion in Germany, the head of the German Federal Police (German Association) defended the German Federal Constitutional Council.
Early Sunday morning Özil personally announced the consequences of the Causa at the ZDF- "Sportstudio" in Brandenburg.
"That's where we need to draw very close conclusions in the future - because we also have a lot of players with a migration background in the U-teams - that something like this is not repeating," the 57-year-old said, seeking to win a federal election without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel once again stated that Erdogan was not in favour of the values of football and the PKK.
This one had denounced with sharp words a racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and grown-up Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They have marginalised them from this society because they have been photographed with me in England, "Erdogan said in the cathedral city on Saturday.
Honestly, as its president, I couldn't digest that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were marginalized.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that unlike Özil after the World Cup affair, which had begun by photos of the two with Erdogan, the latter felt "reasonably treated by the GRT."
At the same time, he announced he would face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - I can't.
"That he has such an impression, I very much regret it," set out to be the one who said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I've always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for Chancellor's return to the national team.
As a conclusion, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed alongside the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If one has a clear impact on society and football without a migration background, and says: "The issue is important, that's where we have to take care of," that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our clubs on the ground where integration needs to work, "Grindel said.
Despite criticisms of his person following the World Cup out and the Özil affair, he wants to run again next year for office as the NCB president.
"I'm doing my job and I'm trying to make them as good as it's going to be," set out in the statement.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Was/Rödental - As police report, the 75-year-old caused Friday's accidents between 10 and 13 a.m.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the louder altitude area.
This informed the pensioner that he would have driven against her car.
However, a staff exchange did not occur as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, police received a telephone message about a motorist who would have walked off the road and driven against a guide post.
Addressed to this, the man did not want police on the ground and subsequently drove away.
After that, the reddish sailed home.
However, in his place of residence where he has lived for decades, the pensioner has settled and, when turned, a construction vehicle has rushed.
After all, police were able to find him and stop him.
His car sustained significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a whopping impression and couldn't get rid of much more.
The damage is about EUR 1300.
Moorbrand in Upper Austria: Almost 1000 road users are still in use.
Around four weeks after the Moorland outbreak on a Federal Military Site in the Frankland, 980 residents are still engaged in the deletion work.
This was notified by the Federal Police on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop stable, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteer aides were last withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of citizens was planned, it says.
On Sunday night, an Upper Earthly Fire had been spotted and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster case had been lifted, which was well over a week earlier on 21 July. September was proclaimed because it had been feared that the flames caused by wind and radio flight put adjacent forests and settlements in danger.
It was then said Thursday that a crossing of the brand on adjacent communities was no longer threatening.
At times on the ground, more than 1500 residents attempted to get the large fire under control.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Federal Military Test site near Upper Austria with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Federal Police.
For 2nd and 5th. October, according to the Federal Police, reconnaissance flights with "tornadoes" are also planned again.
The fire had been triggered by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke fencing of the Moorland had at times moved up to a hundred kilometres far across the north-west of Germany as far as Bremen.
On Monday, the Federal Office wants to set up a contact point that receives damage messages.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hotel owners and holiday owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly a year after the marriage came into force for everyone, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the Jawort on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come true to her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
If we get married, right.
He had been dating his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman for the SPD Federal Council and one of the speakers of the Seehenburg Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the final debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had died on 30 July. June 2017 with a whim speech excitedly excited.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "hijacking" on the issue.
"This was your Schabowski moment," he said, in reference to the accidental proclamation of the East German border opening by Mr Schabowski.
Since 1. October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
Referendum started in Macedonia over new state names
In Macedonia, the highly anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state should be called northern Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province of the same name, the neighbour Greece.
As a means of pressure, Athens had for nearly three decades blocked any rapprochement of Skopje to the EU and Nato.
Should citizens vote yes, they also give the start for their country's western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The Author Who Saves the Shoah From Forgetting

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The registry is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve nationals in stress situations.
Swisstransplant points out that the new procedure does not alter the fact that organs may continue to be taken only with explicit consent.
Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stress situations.
People who want to provide their organs in death can register there.
Your wishes are then available in the case of Swisstransplant.
Swisstransplant points out that the new procedure does not alter the fact that, as in Germany, organs can only be withdrawn with explicit consent.
It is believed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant foundation.
But only in five per cent of cases will a card be found at the crucial moment at possible donors.
In over 60 percent of the talks, relatives do not know the deceased's wish.
"You then have to decide in the sense of the deceased, which is often very incriminating," Immer said.
A similar registration system exists in the United Kingdom.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health card, as the spokeswoman for the Federal Central for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A register where people can enter their wishes - pro or former organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has argued for a reshuffle of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered an organ donor unless he or she disagrees.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in the Copenhagen City
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda of Japan is the world champion in the head field.
He faced 39 runners-up at the weekend in
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Brandenburg Grüß from Germany finished third.
The youngest World Cup contestant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old retired man from France, as chief referee, over-the-counter, has said.
The computer professor from Wroclaw (Saxony) organises the competition every two years.
For example, previous tasks have been: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
As viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants competed against guests from the audience with pocket calculators.
Theresa's greeting from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while reckoning.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Two years ago, as a 14-year-old at the time, Greß was at the same place.
With terms like Superhirn, Genie or Wonderchild, organizer Laue can start little.
"Head football can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even computational competitions aligned in stadiums.
Disciplines include, for example, square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, candidates get surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans would have good chances, the chief referee said.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage, because in early childhood, headfriends are learned more extensively and using other, effective methods.
Intrusive appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows off her sentient and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point to breast cancer with this video and make herself strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings topless of the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover up her most intimate spots.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which is about breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams himself nearly died a year ago.
There were complications at the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
An emergency operation was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clumps were discovered in Serenas Lunge.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government plans to significantly expand the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-blue coalition will send an appropriate bill to the so-called "Symbols Act" in review.
This is intended to significantly extend the number of those terrorist or comparable groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Ms Holle shakes out her beds for the first time in the West next week: On Monday, Polare Cold Air reaches out to the City of Lower Austria, North Tyrol and Salzburg.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Psychiatynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 metres at the start of the week - in narrow valleys it can snatch down at strong intensity to about 1,000 meters, it said.
From Brekow to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimeters of new snow can be expected above 2,000 meters.
On higher-lying pass roads (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, High-Altitude, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglobeen High Alpine Road), the road conditions therefore become winter.
Farmers are allowed to start annual kneeling on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start annual kneeling on Monday.
The "green winds" unique in Germany have shaped the landscape of the low-forest federal country for around 200 years.
The tree and shrub corners up to five metres wide are "whale set" and for many animals and plants the last retreats.
Knicks connect habitats scattered as corridors over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the Nature Conservation Federation Germany (the German Federal Ministry of Applied Sciences) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Bissichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The knicks were laid out due to a command from the Danish king Christian VI. In 1766, which existed over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and cattle fence, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
From that time his name "Knick" also comes from: By "knocking" the branches were able to develop the dense, interlocking demarcation.
Today, around 45 000 kilometres of hedges extend between the North and the Baltic Sea and give the image of a highly woody, diverse structured landscape.
According to the German Federal Ministry of Applied Sciences, they are now used by around 7000 species as a spare habitat.
In a kilometre of knick, up to 1800 different species could live and hatch up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the Knick can only perform its ecologically important function if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Otherwise, he is constipating to a light series of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, also bursts the wind-protection effect, Mr Bissichowski said.
Knelt care may only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesier talks about SItuation on site
The local Radika Pinto, in interview with the Editorial Network Germany (RND), describes the situation on site on Sulawesi Island after the earthquakes and tsunami:
Were you on the scene during the canine itself?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java right now.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
That's when I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours of car after a flight, as the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which are completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also housed other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi staying now?
Many have rushed to surrounding hills where they are still raging out for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people partially steal food and gasoline.
Public service is completely shut down, the national government helps out.
A prison was also destroyed, the inmates run around partially freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information supply work on the island?
Right now we have mobile phone reception, but before that didn't work and we only got information about radio.
A lot of people are still searching for their children, neighbours and other people they don't know if they are living and where they are staying because people were travelling at work, for example, during the earthquakes, not at home.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, not a tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hits the region and they have rushed to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi lying on the Pacific Fire Ring not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this one was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle Injuries Against Thuringia: For a long time it is necessary to forgo Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo are expected to be absent from the-off with severe muscle injuries for longer periods of time.
Aogo pulled a muscle fibrous in the back left thigh in Saturday's 2:1 against the band, the Football Federal Club announced Sunday.
At Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hanover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss matches even after the following country game break.
A forecast at the downtime did not give rise to a return on the company's Stuttgart.
A muscle bundle crack usually heals out within six to eight weeks, and a muscle fiber tear usually heals slightly faster.
Triumph of hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the Film Festival of San Sebastián, the ranks of the most prestigious European festivals are closed annually.
In spite of all departures to the cinema, you can relax: 2018 was a notable year for the film.

On Sunday morning, the Olching Fire Brigade tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action moved on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - strollers at Lake Olto fell into a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stayed in the water station area.
To help the animal, the passersby called the police and the fire department.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to repeatedly evade the operational forces.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
Using a rescue boat, the fire department was able to capture the animal and push it back ashore, where it was then placed into a transport box by a firefighter with an housed handle after nearly an hour.
The duck injured in the chest was then taken to the LMU's animal clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But according to the initial estimates, their chances of survival are rather small.
Biathlet Julian Bonner pushes World Cup medal
Fourth place at Olympia, Biathlet Julian'm in the stomach for a long time.
Next winter, the Dresden Club wants to catch up with the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The final shot cost the 31-year-old in Pyeongchang's Olympic sprint the medal close to grabbing.
Seven tenths ended up missing out on bronze.
"I have deliberately left myself time to process this," says Mr, at the opening of the MyGym gym in his home town of-town, which he says.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
All the more motivated is the Pinzgauer to catch up with the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a major event with the Constitution, to win something.
At some point you have to hit.
The World Cup Loipe in Östersund (SWE) is located in-house: "I've already closed the track in the heart," he recalls with joys at his fourth World Cup event in the individual race the previous year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only individual win for Austria in the previous World Cup event at Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the season he ran second in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation into turbotempo
Time is extremely scarce and the number of scheduled interrogations is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation in the turbotempo, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the skin-thin majority for Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been controversial over requirement allegations.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for investigators until Friday to investigate the more than 30 years of alleged incidents.
The latest turnaround in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's appeal accompanied by a cultural battle had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and first solicitor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the National Chancellor violated angry tirads against opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake, contrary to his original announcement, declared he would agree, but requested an FBI investigation.
After tumour-like scenes, his party friends willed in.
President Trump, who had yet to call Thursday's serious rallies a "mess," initially abstained from further attacks against the women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune."
That way, final doubts could be resolved, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump strongly attacked Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
Also, the White House has extremely limited investigators "powers.
One will specifically investigate the known allegations of two women, more not, a government representative told the Wall Street Journal: 'They're not going on a fishing out.'
According to the "New York Times," only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" by the city municipality of Ried to monitor the tempolimite is, according to the city community, as of Monday, 1. October, stationed at Garden Park.
There is also the Federal School Center.
The town municipality also operates several fix installed radar oxes.
FC Placed 04 after winning against Mainz: You felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and's 04th coach celebrated the first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the factor time also played a role against Mainz.
In the meantime, it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our sports hall, "said the Sports Board of Up 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the Royal Blooms had succeeded in bringing the narrow 1:0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season under the roof and compartment.
In fact, this could have happened differently.
After taking the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11th, the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given safety to Tedesco: "In total, the first half of the season was good, both playful and pressing." Obviously, with increasing playing time, the head played a role more and more.
Creature Actually No Headball Monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," Heidel said: 'If the team was just half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that.'
The boys were afraid to give that out of their hands yet and that's why they kept withdrawing.
And with man and mouse defended against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no unspeakable share of it with his header hit: "In doing so, I'm actually the worst head ball player in man-making."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start pressurising in the early stages and make a fireworks out of it," Schalke's head coach said.
Victory was important.
Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligent, quiet and brave, so we have to tackle lots over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest manko of the afternoon: Royal blue missed it, more of a worry for clearer circumstances.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the gym 59th/72nd or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have become a tremor victory," Tedesco said: "You've already felt the fear a little bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
With that, he wasn't the only shopkeeper.
Fischbachau: Noise column visible in the conduction cylinder 2 km
The smoke was not too overlooked.
From around two kilometres away, a hiker has been spotted watching a fire in the Leitzenig at around 13.30 a.m. on Sunday.
Now police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause soon found out police and firefighters: An unknown had lit up rubbish on a two-square-foot area on Gschwendner Mountain.
According to police, it appeared as if he had monitored the fire for longer periods but then left the glut unattended.
And this near the forest.
30 fish creek firefighters were busy pulling apart and deleting.
Police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild for the repeated time.
"I have made it my task, for many years, to bring interesting people to Upper Austria," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfeld Treffs" - the association that cooperates in hosting the evening with the "Cultural Policy" alliance.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describing the writing process of the book, talking about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable manner.
With lots of gesticity, handheld numbers, and one joke or another, he brings audiences closer to one of the most conflicting themes: Migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise in spite of successful integration?
The Syriac author uses himself in answering the question of a metaphor.
The German society sits at one table, the first-generation migrants at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to co-vote.
This leads to conflict.
For this reason, it is not crucial whether we place ourselves politically on the right or on the left, but whether: "Am I for or against an open society?" he points out.
At first rather behaving, then always reger starts the discussion round.
And there is need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective that two female teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani is up for discussion, not on stage, a point of view: She's at eye level.
The sociology professor does not push up his opinion, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "it is not until we understand what the problem is that we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the following signing hour, he has been discussed an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, in the case of prepared Kurdish specialities.
Basketball: Bonn and casting win World Cup Games
The Giessen 46ers and Telecom Brigitte Bonn finished the first head of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Gießen faced Central German BC 91-84 (43-46) in a hard-fought match in his own hall.
The ambitious Brewers won 86-79 (49-47) at the
The first day of the season is Alba Berlin after Saturday's 112-55 gala against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champions Bayern Munich and the former series champion BroSe had much more effort.
Munich were already struggling to make an 83-77 draw at ratiopharm-as-far back on Friday, and-it won the Frankenderby 84-80 on Saturday at s.Oliver Schmid.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is apparently huge: Over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the rural area of Landsham-Süd on the free market.
This is what Mayor Roland Frick informs us.
In addition, the application phase has been completed for those 20 land that the municipality offers at more favourable terms or prices - similar to the previous pre-mix model.
Well over 100 applications were received, according to Frick.
"The documents are currently being examined," with regard to the criteria for application, completeness and correctness.
According to the Plieninger Mayor, the aim was to have drawn up the candidate rankings for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
After that, the award could be made.
A total of 50 land for single and double houses is created on the area in southern Landsham, as well as four land for multi-family homes with eight housing units expected each.
The development is now as good as complete, and the roads and paths are expected to be tested soon.
A single property as well as two of the half-timbered houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the bulk in the free market, 20 plots in the social-tolerable model.
The community's two half-timbered houses are to be built as affordable housing, according to Frick.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments supported by the University of Applied Sciences.
Room for 200 people
Roughly estimated housing for about 200 people is created on the land area of Landsham-Süd.
Not just that: Now, in early October, according to Frick, the start for the new construction of a construction site is taking place there.
It is intended to house three nursery and three crimson groups as well as a multi-purpose space.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next nursery year.
Thus, Schalke's naldo "great sport" also succeeds on the bench
For the third time not in the starting eleven: Despite this, Naldo would like to say thank you to the team coach Domenico Tedesco.
With Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues sitting for the third time in a row not in the Schalker starting eleven, but on the exchange bench, understanding would have been great in many people had the almost two-metre-tall Brazilian ever spoken to himself so properly the frustration of the soul.
However, when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1-0 victory over the Mainz 05 concentration as usual and head coach Domenico Tedesco pleaded with all his pros, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls simplicity Naldo, switched on and said; "We've got to thank you, coach!"
"This was very emotional, this was great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reservist existence, did not foment any grudge.
Arguably, Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best shopkeeper, knows he hasn't actually got on the siding at his coach - but is given a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control."
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you quite honestly," Tedesco reported of the moment he had told Naldo that he wasn't in the starting eleven.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's about the matter over and over again, it's about the club, "Tedesco founded the move.
Naldo has played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can get through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat, "Tedesco explained the rotation, which last caught Naldo as well.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: By also proving himself to be an exemplary team layer on the bench.
The mood in Austria's industry continued in August, speeding up its valley ride compared to the eurozone.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was up a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
Europe-wide Austria nevertheless has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday for its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike Austria, although the euro zone PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, the index still stands at 13. Month in a row under the brand of 50 counts suggesting growth.
Only Ireland's industry swept this threshold with 50.9 points in August.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, although the mood rate decreased, it was slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March, with 44.0 points.
"While the slightly weakened valley ride could mean the worst has survived," Markit economist Rob Dobson said.
But, in any case, the industry remains number one growth brake in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: Export orders in the eurozone fell as much as they did not since November 2011.
The companies therefore withdrew jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production also fell stronger in China in August than initially thought.
The mood rate fell from 49.3 points the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Manager Index bases its figures on representative surveys by 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, the developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are collected.
Amsterdam's PSG team succeed in winning the eighth league game
29. September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas've continued to rush victory-to-victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won thanks to two goals from superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0), and was thus successful in the eighth league match as well.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
