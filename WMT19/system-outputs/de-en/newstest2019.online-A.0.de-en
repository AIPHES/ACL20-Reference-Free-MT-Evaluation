DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"This is a question that obviously depends on getting into the conversation once, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other the way that was laid down in his statement," Grindel said on the "phrase mower" football podcast "Phrase-mower" Bild newspaper.
Despite the now months-long debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed up to some point that that would be the case, "Grindel said.
De 29-year-old had declared his retirement from the DFB team in July and also justified it by saying that Grindel had not defended him against racial hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that the latter was not ready for a conversation with federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it from football in such a way that when "you leave a squad or you change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a shame that this conversation hasn't come about so far."
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergarten settlement burned
At 2.13pm, the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage power line crosses the shrine garden settlement directly, danger was in default.
The professional fire brigade advanced and found the hut in full fire when the hut arrived.
The roof had to be removed in its entirety and fire debris cleared to the extent absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had put on a battery to charge at lunchtime.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined-as has the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Furious mother fights back: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What only drove Lindsay Lohan to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has live-streamed herself about how she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see ' Happy kissed ' with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, Lohan can be seen getting out of a cart and walking to a possibly homeless family who want her out of Syria as a refugee family.
When the family almost escapes from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
It accuses the adults of trafficking children.
For all that, she doesn't provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan can be heard in the video continuing to follow the family down the street.
Apparently, she's trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems to the obviously angry mother enough.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan misses a slap.
Through tears, the actress then professes how shocked she is-and she holds her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to take this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is said to approach asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The "Mascot" lander will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
There is talk of at least 420 deaths following the severe 7.5-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The number of victims could rise even further, he said.
Rescue crews have not yet made inroads into the devastated and clipped areas by the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla supervisory board chief
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla chief executive Elon Musk caused unrest in stock markets in early August when he announced a retreat from the Eletroautobauer.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now both have come to an agreement.
Tesla and Musk will have to pay, and the Tesla chief executive is withdrawing from the board of directors, but he is allowed to remain chief executive.
British Conservative Party Congress
Sharply-guarded-the Tories "party conference
Birmingham is becoming the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the row between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, on the frontline ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these naming doubles for years.
Now they have come to an agreement.
The state of Macedonia is to be called Northern Macedonia in the future, and this Sunday the population will vote on this-whether it will be a good thing?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not")-meaning jair Bolsonaro.
A week before Brazil's presidential election, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest right-wing populist jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is posing as an anti-system candidate, putting him ahead in the polls.
Its fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Labor Party.
Audi: ' Dieselgate ' reappraisal takes longer than planned
"The diesel taskforce still exists," Development Chief Peter Mertens told industry paper "Automobile Week."
Jailed and on leave Audi boss Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the taskforce would soon be disbanded.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all Motor/transmission combinations are expected to be tested," he had said at the time.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in dealing with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The taskforce had been set up in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal never happened again.
The VW supervisory board had adjourned a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to discuss further this Tuesday.
Investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of allowing the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust levels after the exhaust cheats became known.
In doing so, he knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Chief Executive Officer Bram Schot heads the company as acting CEO.
Because of the switch to the new exhaust and consumption testing standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, Schot told the "Heilbronn Voice."
Basically, he sees a declining demand for sedans such as the A6, A7 and A8 audio models, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electric mobility.
The e-tron, the first Audi electric car, already has 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-election-Lahm to enter DFB presidium
Mainz (AP)-Reinhard Grindel wants to run for DFB president again in spite of criticism of his person after the World Cup end and the Özil affair next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying hard to do it as well as it gets," Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio."
You have to try for re-election again and again, that's what I'm going to do.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "feel like working on the future project" after the award for the European Football Championship 2024.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016, succeeding Wolfgang Niersbach, who was ousted over the summer fairy tale affair.
In the fall of 2016, he was elected to a first full three-year term.
The next vote is due at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future European Championship chief organiser Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB chairmanship.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will continue to discuss this role in the Bureau and then, of course, be cordially invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to take part in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair surrounding the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migrant background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, the Brazilian native Cacau and Celia Sasic are practicing this office, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without an immigrant background clearly works into society and football and says" the issue is important, we have to take care of that, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration Must work, "Grindel said.
Really lose weight with semi-clever scale
I've owned a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat percentage.
She can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index calculates the thing as well, but it's more for the strangling.
After all, he doesn't say anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear start successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin-ALBA Berlin has made an emphatic start to the new season of the Bundesliga with an emphatic victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up won without a hitch with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
New addition Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The international Johannes Thiemann (18 counter), signed from Ludwigsburg, also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators on his mandatory match debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower with the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg pro Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semifinalist MHP giant Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners of Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter with 24 points on coach John Patrick's team.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg began the new season with a clear success.
In the case of the Basketball Lions Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
New playmaker Will Cummings towered over with 25 points with the Oldenburgers.
The Brunswick residents, where NBA star Dennis Schroeder has been majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the Baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, among others, during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening statement, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens-no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
Cologne city centre had been partially closed for the opening of the Ditib Mosque.
Several thousand police officers were on duty-among them snipers.
The Islam association Ditib is under criticism for being seen as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Boots and SchreckSeconds
Musicians including Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and cardi B have touted more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Get involved wherever you can," Mendes told a crowd of around 60,0000 at the festival on Sunday in front of around 60,0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringe and gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid agencies, also showed up on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a horror second when many onlookers thought the sound of an encasing metal cordon was gunshots, got scared and tried to flee.
Kurz arose panic, people ran up.
Seven spectators were slightly injured in the process, event organiser Hugh Evans said.
However, New York police and musician Chris Martin then reassured people from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anybody," Martin said.
You are all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available for free on the internet, as they do every year.
If you wanted to get hold of them, you had to read and redistribute texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there were cheers and applause from the audience-boos, on the other hand, for Republican Sen. Jeff Flake.
This, while joining his Democratic colleague Chris Coons on stage, spoke out in favour of greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, though, Flake had spoken out in the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice, headbutting many women.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse up to and including the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which the latter rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who say they themselves experienced sexual assault, confronted him in an elevator on their way to the committee meeting.
"You can also get together with me in an elevator at any time," Flake now said to the crowd at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: Federal government defends journalist's ejection
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the ejection of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
At the chancellery, the Turkish journalist, who lives in Hamburg, had pulled over a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the front row.
The T-shirt, was not the problem, Seibert told Bild am Sonntag.
It was about a disruption to the course of the press conference.
The journalist's action created a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had therefore caused personal protectors to take the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at news conferences at the chancellery.
This is entirely true regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
There are many journalists in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
Turkish leaders blame the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: It was not until early September that the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of jailed journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
Although they were released and were able to return to Germany, trials are still under way in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg-and had a wild night!
Hamburg-The "Inas Nacht" talk show, produced by the NDR, is known for wet-happy conversations at the counter of Hamburg's port pub "haddock posts."
Presenter Ina Müller tokes up many beer, some wine or even high-percent drinks with her guests in order to loosen the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities also take heart for the obligatory vocal interludes.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from movies like "Men's Heart," "Terror-Your Judgment" or "The Greinciest Day."
But the Munich trip to the far north did not get any good at all.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie-his face completely crumpled on it, eyes just two small slits left.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
Yet he is not sick, he has only one mighty hangover.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some-arguably not entirely serious-findings he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And the round of eggnog that Ina chucks at half past three, also omits.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the 43-year-old's face.
His fans immediately posted a few tips for combating the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish buns or-presumably most purposefully-headache tablets.
Others simply amused themselves at the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
How Ina Müller survived the nocturnal record is not yet known.
However, since she has been hosting the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested ...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has struggled with vandalism and rubbish
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hood country in Treysa is difficult to find and littered.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions barely loom.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished garbage bins and now dismantled signs-this is how the entrance with a seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the showpiece Bahnradweg in the Red Riding Hood country, a more than inglorious sight.
The topic has been on the subject of members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt, but also others for some time, according to the cycling traffic officer of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Board, he said.
There has been no solution so far.
Proposals ranged from laying the seating group to regularly emptying the waste bins and cleaning the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day-regardless of possible further activity," Wüstenhagen says.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also introduced the topic to the local advisory council.
It's not just the rubbish that drives cyclists and local residents around-the seating group is a regular hangout to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, the money is also destroyed: Posts ripped from the ground, dustbins demolished, signs buckled, seating furniture smears.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more frequently, ADFC member Susanne Klippert recounts.
The actions, however, are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They resent that the rest stop at the bike path in Treysa is a meeting place for Saufgelage.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus here is clearly on the Haace hill," confirms the cycling operator, who is now also concerned about the new bike site in Ziegenhain, which is opening today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea, he said, is video surveillance on the hill: "This may set the threshold significantly higher to grab a common good.
However, this would presuppose that a police patrol will pass in a timely manner.
Basically, Wüstenhagen wants the Haace Hill to develop.
It must be made more attractive.
The frequency of the cycle path so far could be very satisfied.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high quality compared to others in Germany, "said ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in the Ascheröder Strait in Treysa.
There is no turn on the Haace hill.
In the case of busy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between the flow of traffic on both sides, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but it is not a problem for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest in the cultural station: The "Kö of Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in togetherness.
"D to offer a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "Music Contest for musicians big and small, young and experienced."
A contest "with a twinkle in his eye in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family togetherness over coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturhof station.
Seven formations competed, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long album devotees living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper star colors," three members and three generations of Family Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the Lummerland nursery and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
That contest, District Mayor Joachim Schmidt explained, is a novelty.
We haven't experienced that in other neighborhoods.
What did the copywriters see themselves with?
In the places, Lake Hiltruper and Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "the" Kö von Hiltrup "in his envelopy song.
The cultural station has also been honoured.
Again and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short rebuilding breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
So it was learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now he was also teaching guitar.
Franke was able to report from sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently performed in Ludwigshafen-at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has placed all sorts of places on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
There was still something special for the judges ' favourites-so others can also listen to their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Him with his Hiltrup hit, which impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "A very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tariffs.
Like everyone, the children performed again for the finale-sounding "really good" even without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß of KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Business Association as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the City Party Offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event to mark its tenth anniversary.
She rated the event as a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon to be very crowded cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side, there's a sightsvial, in it four cards with keywords that you-the old trick with the red foil-can't decipher until you've put them in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the maps, for example, it says, from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2nd window.
3. Dice.
4th feast. "
These are the terms to be encrypted from now on.
Because it is not the terms, but codes that should be guessed here.
Alternately, one player per team is the encryption.
He gets a code card on which maybe "3.4.2." Is.
In "Decrypto," the terms behind the secret film are to be guessed, but not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: To describe-in this order and in this example-the terms "dice," "feast" and "window"-in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible does not; Because that wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
The encryption, then, notes and reads aloud: "Throwing" for the dice, "lots" as opposed to feast; Here, of course, something like "party" would also be possible and "Prague" would be possible because he has been paying attention at school and knows the window fall there.
So it goes round by round, team by team continues.
One does not know the terms of the other side-but it can come together better with every hint that the encryper gives there.
So the rewrites should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule booklet.
The players will probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanatory video at decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But once you get started, you'll be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this unassuming game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames," which is also an agent theory on a game of fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if it's all about rates and not victory points, you can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and molested guests in pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspectorate Kulmbach on the night from Saturday to Sunday equal double.
First he showed the Hitler salute in the Upper City of a passing police patrol, later he also caught the eye in the Upper City in a pub as he harassed other guests.
After clearly failing to comply with the granted place reference by police, he had to spend the night at the Crimean Culmbach police inspectorate at the detention centre.
In a sober state, he must then also face criminal charges for using the hallmarks of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig plant was home to the Schubloks
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers popped on buffers, you heard it all over Pressig," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes also squeaked and buttoned the carriages.
That was pure railroad.
Statements that are emblematic of Dinkel's homeland, Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railways.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which after a ascent of about 220 meters of altitude has its apex in Steinbach on the forest.
To cope, train and thrust locomotives were previously needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway operating workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, proversion and railway master's office.
"The centrepiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional owner for 47 years.
Locomotives for the Pressig-Tettau, Ludwigsstadt-Lehesten, Stockheim-Sonneberg and Kronach-NordHalf lines were also operated by the railway plant (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; Thirteen steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and drawer locomotives.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weights were still ranked each month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were canceled, and in 1991, the rest were canceled.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we have not envisaged a better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport."
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig on the anniversary "50 Years of Electrification Nuremberg-Saalfeld."
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, the off.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the marshalling yard Pressig was history.
"The shMarshers and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Any mishandling would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station led Pressig-Rothenkirchen for the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber up with upstart success at China Open
Beijing (AP)-Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing like Julia Görges before.
Kerber has won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 over France's Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakh or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund was leading 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian, who was placed at number 13, gave up.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Enjoyment," a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach over the weekend.
With great relief, organizers and visitors registered the ideal weather when the Special Opening "Wind Game Performance" opened in the open-air area of the Dahlmann-Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the "Around ums Walberla" tourism association as part of the series "Art and Enjoyment."
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large audience award showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be seen in Mittelehrenbach.
Home owner Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists at the opening of the opening of the opening.
He himself has been there since the very first hour.
As did Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
Somewhat surprisingly, though, Hahn announced his retirement a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in a proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have helped shape flyers.
This year, on the occasion of Kunst & Enjoyment, there will once again be a 70-cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
There, this year's poster "Betzn austanzen," designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was won for the musical framing.
Walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "wind game performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor awaits the visitor on the right side of the "lucky tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, colour-brightened, playfully with 20 wind turbines, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object looks fairytale and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate herself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K & G.
There are many parts, in motion in the wind.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child."
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows off his colorful fantasy structure of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "wind game performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be viewed until 31 December 2018.
50 Years of MGV 68 Alglitts: Singers celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968-that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albassehers also gave vent to their displeasure at the time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to put up with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more sanexistence in the district.
It has since become a legend: At a bench in the Tinnenbusch, they lifted the MGV 68 algait out of the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter."
"It's going to be full today," guessed chairman Jurgen Holstiege, and he should be proved right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachist singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it was made, for festive clothes had been asked beforehand.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Encounter," but comfortably at tables.
In between, movement was the order of the day: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and asked for the dance floor.
Honorality, that the singers of the MGV 68 were made the voice sound themselves.
In keeping with the occasion, cheerful songs were the order of the day.
Almost set: "Such a day, as beautiful as today."
In keeping with the exquisite vines many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheim wine."
Alluding to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" rang out, which is the Latin term for "hops."
Again, the choral direction was by Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Spider's bush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said: "He's got such an easy way, it's a feat he's accomplishing." By the way, this time it wasn't just men who presented themselves singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 1920s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three in the morning to create rhymes of his own.
Andreas Winterhoff also presented fine-sounding poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds are intended to fund the children of the Albatros Youth Centre with a visit to the all-weather zoo.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The up-and-comer marches.
Three games, three wins-USC Munster's reserve under the auspices of Axel Büring finds itself in really good terms in League Three.
No trace of shyness or frack whizzing, the independents do their thing.
And that's really good at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city rival BW Aasee.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we've already made an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We're not dissatisfied. ' On the contrary.
In the evening at an after-the-fact birthday celebration by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they get that to the finish, a game like this can be overturned before," Büring knows from years of experience.
Eventually, USC made it all clear with its routine powers, bringing the full yield to the finish.
' We're all aware of who's on the other side in such a derby.
That doesn't break our genius.
I saw really good volleyball in phases, "Annacker did not hat with the 0:3-and immediately moved on to business as usual.
Where the journey goes for the independents seems unforeseeable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one thing does he feel vindicated: "League 3 has an incredibly good level.
It's nowhere near comparable to regional league volleyball. ' Into the fourth division, they don't want to turn their gaze down anyway.
Should the vest not be tarnished in the next few weeks, they will have to look up.
However, a first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee competes in Essen on October 14.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship," Heide Keller became a star.
Now she talks candidly about how the series may have been a complicity in her marriage say with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went off board for good.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929-2013), to whom she was married for 10 years.
' That might have been a reason as well.
Because I came of age with this work, travelled the world alone with a suitcase and many colleagues I admired perceived me on an equal footing, "Keller recounts in conversation with the" Bild am Sonntag. "
At first she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "dream ship."
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
' Whether he liked that so much, I don't know. '
She thinks it's possible that her man at the time might well have been envious, but "like many men, Han's conversations about problems and feelings also shunned."
Keller always tried to be "the only right thing for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good English: I have adjusted myself, "as she explains further.
She always felt "not good enough for him."
He saw in me an emancipated woman who, in truth, I never was, even if I seemed cheeky and brave on stage at times.
I wanted our love to be forever. '
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding ceremony, I sat howling in the dressing room and wanted to cancel it all.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never worked out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller envisioned love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I've approached love far too naively. '
The night butterfly, which regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has ventured to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our butterfly is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the garish glow a green carpet has dipped into on the six-seated course unduly dazzles it.
But it is just film festival, more or less famous people want to bask in the spotlight.
So he torcases across the pitch that late Thursday night to briefly ease up in the "Aquaclean WC oasis."
This is what the public toilet complex sponsored by a large sanitation company is sponsored and which premieres at the festival: The hospital in the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
That evening, however, it stinks to heaven in the men's oasis for some reason.
So out here, over to the other side of the road: Loaded guests, who just entertained the opening film "Green Book" at the best level in the cinema next door, celebrate the festival start every year with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: As is well known, the works on display come from all over the world.
What do you not have to come up with in an article about this festival so as not to fall into surreptitious advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly ties a banter around the feelers that has inflicted a good fairy on him, and two bullish bouncers actually wave it in generously.
Inside, the jaunts crowd, dancing to live music well past midnight or letting DJ dictate rhythms to which they shout at each other, flushing down exquisite morsels with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters wait for slurping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly sliced open, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves of fully exclusive products have not been cleared out for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The butterfly studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please beware on the escalator."
If that's two separate instructions, he has squandered in the dress code.
But it is more of a conditioning construction, and it has certainly already saved lives.
In the household goods section upstairs, the poultry flips an espresso made cocktail called "Golden Eye," matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, is not necessarily awarded the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting said brand for years, isn't here on the evening either.
But since, between local celebrity, cash table and kitchen articles, a face passes over that seems familiar to the Observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His leading actor is unlikely to be far away from that.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, at a soon sixty acting almost like a choirboy, walks through the crowd.
He is not swapped at, not begged, one shells stealthily at most.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as a bondiness, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team's win.
Argentina football legend Diego Maradona appears to have settled in well in his new home of Mexico.
After a 2:0 win by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to cumbia rhythms with a player in the cabin, according to a video released earlier on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow-colored jersey, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second-division player had defeated the Leones Negros 2:0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has coached the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: Association League 1: ASV sending after last-minute bust ' devastated '
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association league ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat." His protégés were "devastated" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14)-bust-fourth in the fourth game-on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
They had not played badly-as in Steinhagen, as in against üllHorst-over wide phases, the Sendenters.
Only the initial phase "we totally slept," the ASV coach teased.
Quickly, the landlords led with 8:1, even the early time off Bieletzki had taken, did not initially play fruit.
"But then all of a sudden a jolt went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
For the break, the gap was only two more goals.
Senden's best, Marius Hintze, in particular, met at the stage at the end of the other.
Things got even better from a visitor's point of view after the change.
After 33 minutes David Ernst equalised for the 15:15, after which the relay changer led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly a calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Incentered the impartial events.
Bieletzki is usually wary of taking the blame on others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff cashed "was a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end-while the decimated ASV also failed in the final attack.
The boys fought great, stood well at the back as well against seven men and kept throwing on the empty goal.
Only they can buy themselves little for the compliments.
"Now has a hell of a victory," says Bieletzki, who was perfectly served.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bayern: Woman missing for 30 years-police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (Hof county), police are searching for the woman's remains.
Emergency crews dug up a road at Marxgrün on Saturday.
To this end, the road surface and several layers below were taken down, as police and prosecutors jointly announced.
According to new evidence, the missing may not have been buried far from where she lived at the time.
The woman has been missing since November 4, 1986.
Investigators also did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Investigation Court, along with the prosecution, has been working intensively on the case again, according to the details.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Heritage Protection Agency, the investigators met with a conspicuousness under the road at Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, officials bounded the spot to a few feet.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.

Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his looming recall as head of the billionaire firm.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) out-of-court filed a legal battle over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run publicly traded companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk relinquish the office of chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German supervisory board chief.
He is allowed to remain chief executive against it.
In the settlement, which has yet to be upheld by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned executive in Manhattan U.S. federal court for fraud.
Musk, who also chairs space firm SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is unaware of no guilt
Musk had it explained that he had done nothing wrong and was saddened and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock market, paying $420 per share in the process, with funding secured.
That would have valued Tesla at $72 billion overall.
Later, Musk rowed back: Tesla remained on the stock market.
After the settlement, Tesla must now find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members and also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.

' Let's Dance ' juror Joachim Llambi and wife Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi has probably split from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert is best known for the RTL show "Let's Dance."
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi, 54, and his wife Ilona, 45, are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhalinhalt) reports on the separation of the well-known presenter and dance expert, citing Llambi's lawyer.
"Our clients have separated consensually and amicably," the lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser told "BamS".
Most important to the two now is the well-being of their two daughters.
The pair had met at a pizzeria in 2003, according to the report, and married two years later.
Joachim Llambi is from Duisburg and was a successful tournament dancer and stock broker.
Llambi is best known on television for his judging work on the celebrity dance show "Let's Dance" on RTL, as well as various appearances on quiz and entertainment shows.

Polls: 46 percent don't want Merkel as chancellor by 2021
After the squabbles of the past few weeks, the GroKo is cashing in on several poll lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a poll-Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin-The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid-Sunday trend for Bild am Sonntag.
In the polling institute's weekly poll, the AfD puts up one count on 17 percent, with the SPD giving up a point compared to the previous week and ending up at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU are also losing a counter, only getting to 27 percent.
That is the lowest value yet for the Union on Sunday.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag election were to be held on Sunday, the governing parties the SPD, CDU and CSU together would get just 43 percent of the vote, according to Emnid.
As a result, the grand coalition has currently lost a majority on the Sunday issue at all major research institutes-with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently come to 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
Together, they received 53.4 percent in the 2017 federal election.
The range is also wide among the other parties, with the AfD, the second-strongest in several polls, coming in at 15 percent to 18 percent.
The Greens reach vote shares of 12.5 percent to 17 percent.
The left is averaging 10 percent, while the FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, depending on the share of the vote, such surveys have an upward and downward uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent.
But popular support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also dropped significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens still find Merkel the right thing to do in the chancellery, the Emnid poll on behalf of the BamS found.
Only one in two (50 per cent) currently want the grand coalition to hold until the next regular federal election in three years, according to the poll, with 41 per cent in favour of a new election.
A further poll released on Saturday also showed significant losses in popularity for Merkel.
Divided, the Germans are also assessing whether Merkel should run again for the CDU chairmanship in December.
47 percent are in favor, according to Emnid; 44 percent oppose it.
As a result, 64 percent of Union supporters would like to see a candidacy, while 35 percent do not want to run.
Fit at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories-you should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich-In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket almost exudes an anachronistic romance as a place of interest for great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer-short bargains at the wilt table or the favourite pudding is still, in doubt, a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being not so much a contact exchange as a slippery stock exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react, how do you not talk around the bush for long in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood lovestory potential is when the love fortune is preceded by an out-of-the-eye-lost and rediscovered plot.
If the guy then also reports to his worshipped at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts-Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So the copyright of this Annonce in an Aldi branch unknown to us is wishing that she would also find her dream man, with whom she spoke briefly about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat."
For believing in the magic of analog getting to know each other, she definitely deserved her happy ending à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgerischule has been participating in the campaign "Cover against polio-500 lids for a life without polio."
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polio viruses.
The disease, known in German as polio, leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polio viruses, can so far only be contained by vaccinations, according to a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc call for calm for idol
Leverkusen (AP)-BVB athletic director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
' We should stop worrying about Mario.
That doesn't do the boy any good.
And that doesn't do us any good, "Götze-friendly Reus told TV station Sky after the 4:2 win at Leverkusen.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No rush in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (AP)-Manager Max Eberl of the Bundesliga side of Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no rush in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.

"There will most certainly be the moment we sit down and talk, though," Eberl said on TV channel Sky on Sunday night.
Football: District League: Researchers ' appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this fledgling season when Alois Fetsch went to court hard with his senses.
Wortkarg he gave himself, the coach of the football district club VfL Wolbeck, retired (internally) first to muse about the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
Meanwhile, it's running around the Brandhoveweg again.
Baptismanous evidence is the 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the past season only floated thinly past the ascent.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the performance.
' We've done the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen, "Fetsch praised his boys, looking up every individual after the game to simply say" thank you "for so much opposition to the ambitious guests.
In doing so, the coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After Nico Frerichs's injury (muscular problems)-for him came Luca Rehberg-it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes waited in the front line for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his Aus (17th), who moved in Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost that would have avenged itself when the SCA pitched dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box twice in the minute 41 in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer-goal man Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his subject.
After the break, the VfL cheekily took full control.
Thewes from 18 yards narrowly failed.
Schroer, too, was late after 58 minutes at a Thewes entry.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch missed another fresh cell cure on the left side.
When Altenrhein Chris Naberbäumer felled Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free-kick for the placeholders 18 metres before the guest case.
The poulary competed himself and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues "thing with the right snap struck down the left from the shooter's point of view-1:0 (71st).
20 minutes still, which should be damn long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather unhappily to the hand in the penalty area in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (hamm) immediately pointed to the spot.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79th).
Volume minutes Wolbeck had to survive in the closing stages before Geske had the winning goal on the puff in the 87th minute from twelve yards.
Would perhaps have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas-N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer-Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann-Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske)-Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4:1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five matchdays-coach Adi Hütter couldn't do that.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure their first home win.
Striker Ante Rebic, who was first in the starting XI after injury, should help with that.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also at it again after a pubic injury and, with his head ball strength, was expected to prevent the SGE from cashing in further goals by standards.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
On landing, the accident occurred at the airfield.
The four occupants were slightly injured.
There was a drama at the airfield in Kottingbrunn at around 2pm on Sunday.
Turbulence occurred when a helicopter landed, police have confirmed to oe24.
The heli was captured by a wind gust, crashing to the ground and coming to a side-by-side standstill.
Police, rescue and fire brigade were immediately notified.
With a large number of emergency crews, the emergency crews came to the scene of the accident.
The emergency emergency helicopter for the OAMTC was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Thankfully, it all turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one damage to property.
The four occupants were only slightly injured and were able to go back home on their own.
The exact circumstances surrounding the accident have not yet been determined and are the subject of the investigation.
According to fire brigade spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire of origin, which could be quickly extinguished.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on company boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the boards as of the September 1 deadline were female, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture," which will be officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was in advance to the German Press Agency.
"Companies will have to line up differently, otherwise international competitors will pass them by," said foundation chief executive Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male leadership teams-with a few exceptions-are no longer conceivable.
The backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and forward-looking in comparison.
It's a different corporate culture.
Moreover, the slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies was solely attributable to positive impulses among companies in the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
True, only 6.8 per cent of boards are female, according to Allbright data.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
The proportion of women among the 30 Dax companies-pioneers in recent years-stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I'm sure the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women again in the coming year-in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that they would not have made a voluntary commitment to increase the proportion of "zero percent" so far.
A different picture emerges for the supervisory boards: As of 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 per cent-45 more women and 68 fewer men than just a year ago.
"If you recruited just as many women annually for the boards, a 40 per cent share would have already been achieved in 2023," the report said.

Who makes the most profit per car among the noble suppliers.
Munich-Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers cash in per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows: The differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros in operating profit with every car sold in the first half of the year-Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley put on each car vigorously even.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well racing with prices averaging 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in earnings before interest and tax EBIT.

Torchlight procession for the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Wine Festival
With a torchlight procession, the Tourist Association opened its wine test session in Abtswind.
For the 60th time, the club is hosting the wine festivals, which from now on rise every Saturday in October in the large marquee on Rehweiler Strasse.
At the start of the anniversary, those responsible moved under the sounds of the Spielmann train from Wiesenbronn through the village to the festival square.
The chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and Wine Princess Lisa Kursawe, welcomed the guests in the already prop-and-tested marquee. ' to align something like this for 60 years-that's a madness feat for a small town with 800 residents.
You can be proud of that, "Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine princess Lisa II later symbolically nudged with the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many have found their way to Abtswind again." Later, "The Troglauers" provided a mood.
On Sunday, when the Abtswinder church consecration was also celebrated, the club had set the drinks prices as they were 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival will take place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before entering the second round a day later in the marquee.
In Bonn: Emergency doctor's car crashes into taxi
An emergency medical car stands badly damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old female passerby has been fatally injured in the emergency vehicle collision with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they are supposed to help-preferably even saving lives.
Such a rescue drive came to a deadly end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn-A 26-year-old female pedestrian has been fatally injured in the collision of an emergency medical car with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, emergency doctor and her driver were seriously injured, police have announced.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency doctor's car had run over a red light with blue light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then bumped into an intersection with the taxi driving at Green.
The doctor's car hurled against a traffic light pole and a tree after the collision.
In the process, he captured the passerby, who died at the scene of the accident.
Drivers of emergency medical car and female taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the emergency medical car driver were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed by emergency crews.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another called emergency physician tried to do so-but to no avail.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
Police are investigating, in close coordination with the Bonn prosecutor's office, who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho we made it uncomfortable
After the disgraceful off in the league clash, Manchester United are now also losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1:3. The manner of defeat is likely to give one more to talk about.
Emblematic was the scene in the 74th minute in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic shot 3:1 for West Ham; Just three minutes after Marcus Rashford supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Suspecting an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester's defenders stopped, leaving Arnautovic with all the time in the world to kick the ball past helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of a performance that had been insufficient for a long time.
The mood at Unating's city rival Manchester City is very different at the moment.
The Citizens, coached by Mourinho's great competitor Pep Guardiola, came to an unendangered 2:0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the outside's defensive bar for the home team for the first time.
Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth win in the seventh game after a good hour and a double pass with the former goalscorer, and with it also the leap to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leaders
Three days after the 1:2 defeat at the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought for a 1:1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As with the Cup Aus, Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man with the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game into the closing stages.
Shaqiri, who took to the field for Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute, still narrowly missed the equaliser after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his slacker.
So after the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea were unbeatable for the second time.
First the Londoners eliminated Jurgen Klopp's team in the Cup, through which draws in the league the Blues now also toppled Liverpool from the top of the table.
Like City, London's two City clubs Tottenham (at Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2:0 wins.
However, fans of the Gunners, with Granit Xhaka playing through, had to condone themselves to a success message until the 81st minute against the surprise team from Hertfordshire county.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart buxed a input from Alex Iwobi unhappily into his own goal, just two minutes later Mesut Özil made sure of the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to their fifth successive win and are newly immediately behind great rivals Tottenham in rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave a strong impression on up-and-comers Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves went unbeaten in the 2:0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth year in a row, finishing 8th.
VW core brand missing: Paris car salon in sign of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in alternation with the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Paris-Officially not an issue and yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits are unlikely to let go of German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris either.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showing their latest products from next week together with competition from all over the world in the French capital.
Diesel doesn't really play a big role in this anymore.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, are nevertheless likely to be an important topic, at least behind the shining scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electric models with them: The e-tron of the Ingolstadt residents is due to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
Officially presented, however, both have already been presented.
BMW's iNext is not scheduled to launch until 2021.
At the heart of Paris is the new 3 Series.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle builders as well as numerous mobility service providers and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in alternation with the Frankfurt Motor Show.
In 2016, a good million visitors came.
The severe earthquakes and the tsunami that followed have killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island had been rocked by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake was magnitude 5.9, the second magnitude 7.4.
Communications and transport links are damaged and enormous damage to property has been caused.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke out over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that casualty figures are still clearly going up.
So far, the figures have only come from Palu.
However, numerous other communities-along Sulawesi's west coast-are also affected.
About 150 bikers celebrate service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schroeder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists at the Peace Church in Eveking with a team of helpers on Sunday.
Werdohl-The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schroeder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is therefore responsible for the pastoral affairs of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) at Haus Nordhelle is always held on the last Sunday of a month.
Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season at the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, around 150 bikers had gathered on Sunday to mark a service far from ordinary.
As early as 10 a.m., the Bolides were lined up in front of the church's entrance portal.
At first the biker early shopping was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or already with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was delivered during the biker service of the Rev. Dirk Grzegorek.
Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical accompaniment.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill strikes rather poetic-calm tones," says the Rev. Frank Schroeder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Foetgoter hometown club celebrates big feast: After the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly made apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and, step by step, demonstrated to his astonished viewers the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the children to the field and had them fill the apples into the large funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how this would become a tasty drink.
But they could also look at this important step of work that late Friday afternoon.
Packed into molds and encased in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg piled the apple pieces on top of each other a little like crochet handsome apple pieces.
Thanks to a certain technical support, the last step was not so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the foettor-pecker farmer also already had finished bottled specialities with him.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest feather whites to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents got into a conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of squeezing the apple, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Active of the concomector-style camaraderie of former soldiers also engaged in the course of the festival and invited at some stations to entertaining games.
The hometown club will continue to offer a day of action in the coming year.
But then, Gregor Krützkamp pointed out, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: After all, it will go round the milk.
1:4 v Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season bust: "Shitty situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in succession, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
However, there were not previously many positive things to be seen in the 1:4 (0:2) of the stand-last at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out there as a team," 96 football pro Pirmin Schwegler said, shoving: "That's obviously disappointing, because you always make a lot of difference."
The further victorious Lower Saxons, for whom only Florent Muslija (86th) met, are at the bottom with two counters and are a relegation candidate in their current constitution.
Led by the towering Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated their first season home win.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th. Minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who finished with seven points after the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Rome. Midfield of the table advanced.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action by the Hesse on his starting fdebut and never got a grip on Hanover's defence.
The striker, who has been beaten up for a long time after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable to concord.
In addition to Rebic, Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, also stood for the first time in the opening formation of the Frankfurt residents, who started swinging.
A header from Lucas Torró (17th), forged on the goal net, brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defence around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term outlandish Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a fended corner, Haller extended per head in front of goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender who came from French second division side AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt was still laying down before the break.
This time, Haller suited up to his storm partner Rebic, who skillfully tricked and left 96 goalie Michael Esser with no chance.
At half-time, Hannover coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak showing of his elf, bringing in two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played a little more courageously forward, but ignition ideas failed to materialise until shortly before the end, when the connecting goal was finally achieved.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After a close hour, Rebic launched a solo and then put cross-legged on De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only show-running for the Frankfurt residents against overwhelmed guests, with Jovic still hitting a minute before the end.
Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Cube Despite cool temperatures, there was a good mood at Oktoberfest in the city centre.

Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14 or the Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the town church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shot Christ, who dates back to the 30-year-old war and on which, according to legend, a Swedish soldier is said to have fired.
Blood then flowed from the gunshot wound.
From this developed a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished to this day, only the sanctuary stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, the Rev. Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly attended despite the importance to the Geisinger parish.
After the divine service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the ecclesiastical part of the Cross Festival ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting you to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish.
The choir members provided visitors with savoury food as well as a wide selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm hagei.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the façade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming ones. Construction that will drag on into next year.
Since the scaffolding has been around for some time, the damage could be determined in more detail and the individual tenders prepared more specifically.
What is certain is that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but more has also been established, which was only made possible by the appearance by means of scaffolding.
The plinth plastering work has been completed, the natural stone work is to be started before the winter and it is hoped that well over half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New dormitory on New Ulm Münsterblickstraße
The Danube-Iller Life Aid opens a new dormitory for people with disabilities on Münsterblickstraße.
That in Münsterblickstraße "a very special house" is now handed over to its destination-all those present agreed at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the Danube-Iller life support dormitory for some time are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free entrances for all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began around eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building came under scrutiny for handy-cap residents: "The house had been ages to date and no longer contemporary in equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the diggers advanced to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life Aid Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
Life support invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, while the district of Schwaben contributed EUR 450000.
According to architect Bader, the construction work remained within the planned framework-both temporally and financially.
The managing director of life support, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between an barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which allows the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move even without outside help.
The head of the Social Administration of the district of Swabia, Gertrud Kreutmayer, also commented similarly: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile."
In doing so, homeliness and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
Adding: ' The plot of land in this location is a real stroke of luck because it is so unavailable in today's situation. '
In total, the new dormitory on Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities, divided between three residential groups, on almost 1500 square metres.
Life aid managing director Heinz is proud of the 11 full-time employees, all employed by tariff.
Germany: Weesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin-Before Unity Day, SPD deputy federal leader Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to resign themselves to the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after nearly 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences, "the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania told" Tagesspiegel am Sonntag. "
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions across the country, he said.
It was unacceptable, he said, that East Germans worked longer hours on average than the people of West Germany, but would receive 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Psgian hunting dog is said to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease ties with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean PEntan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced Sunday, the two about one-year-old dogs reached their recipient as early as Thursday.
They passed through the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to "make it easier for the animals to get used to it."
The dogs, with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes, are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship bid had been announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
In doing so, both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and to bid together to host the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion.
Austria's troubled history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the centenary of the republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of remembrance, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect over the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archives, offers it in the magnificent "picture book" of Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for government
Back to factual work-that's the unofficial motto for the Grand Coalition's working week, which begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not, in the last, conjured up the "return to factual work."
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and factual work, but be it.
If the federal government is now ready to rededicate itself to its mission-to govern-it should not now be stopped from doing so with conceptual debates.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks may already be shown by Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round on a regular basis in order to defuse conflicts early; A lesson from all the strife.
First of all, however, conflict-prone issues are once again on the agenda with the Diesel retrofits and the Expert Immigration Act.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange premiums, the SPD and CDU see the manufacturers as obliged to technically retrofit older diesels.
While a rapprochement has emerged over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned expert immigration law.
The SPD is calling for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do an apprenticeship.
The Union is strongly opposed to the ' change of lane ' from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be strife among coalition partners again-and how could it be otherwise?
It is not the same and the same that has joined forces for GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without strife, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests will not make progress.
But in order to be constructive, dispute must not be rekindle on the question of being or not being for party tactical reasons.
This is still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD should argue-but always have an eye on the reality of the lives of the people.
What is feasible and benefits many?
With this key question, both the diesel and lane change issues can be clarified pragmatically-and thus regain trust.
Above all, the people's parties must fight for this now.
Mushroom checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in his sights
Does the Minister of Labour, of all people, violate the current right of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" her legists would have worked on social security reform, an exuberant social care minister reported at the presentation of themselves two weeks ago.
With list mushroom mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is astonished-she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via a question.
She said "that the minister only wanted to express her excitement at the use of her team and in no way to announce violations of current law of service in front of running cameras."
Even so, she now has questions to allow Hartinger to "absolve of any suspicion."
Police rip up a street in search of women's corpses
Marx Green-The police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is confirmation.
A dug has been taking off on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben since early Saturday morning.
The line is still closed in the area of Marx Green until Monday.
This was preceded by investigators having previously deployed an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, and its guide in several missions were finally able to narrow down the relevant spot to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the said street piece.
For more than a year, prosecutors and criminal investigation court have been handling the missing persons case.
Again and again, a bike path was closed at Marx grün and examined with sonar equipment, because investigators suspect that Heke's body may have been buried here in the course of the new construction of the state highway 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of Catalonia's disputed independence referendum.
But even before that, there are riots.
The separatists have not forgotten the fall 2017 police operation.
Barcelona-Clashes between separatists and police have erupted in central Barcelona shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of October 1, 2017.
Catalan security forces were attacked with paint powder by independence supporters, among other things, as they sought to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honour their colleagues with a rally who were on duty at polling stations last year in the referendum deemed illegal.
Violence had also occurred in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting at the time.
Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the 6000 or so separatists would then have forcibly tried to break the police chain, pelting officers with paint bags and eggs, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, it said, citing authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region from Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under forced administration in the autumn of 2017.
The regional president at the time, Carles Puigdemont, fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also defbed abroad.
Several ministers of the regional government at the time and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, remain in U-custody.
New elections had been held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But new regional president Quim Torra also insists on Catalans "" right to self-determination. "
Football: Oberliga Westphalia: Enlied perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen part goalless
Red-white Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
At FC Gütersloh, too, it only was enough for a 0:0 draw.
The closing light and the third last they turned out to be a gathered perplexity in front of 438 spectators at the Heidewald Stadium.
The first half was very manageable by the entertainment factor.
Those who would prefer to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so without any worries.
There was no danger of missing a scoring chance because there was virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Gülohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) shot of the goal of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The Ahlenians had the best-and, in principle, only real-possibility when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling into a parade with a shot from the penalty man boundary after 32 minutes.
Even more innocuous were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schroeder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the switch, both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel aimed just above the enclosure from 18 metres and after an hour the Gütersloher also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball conquest by Matthew Wieckowicz it went fix.
The swiftly presented counter over Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62nd) with a but lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also conceded with a header from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball by ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, bringing in first Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did-nothing.
The Ahlenians did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but even that didn't bring in anything.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero." But unfortunately, the zero was also in front.
"We were not as goal-dangerous this time as we were against Holzwickede and that was even though our opponent had no desire to play here," RW Ahlen's interim coach noted.
Offensively, "it all rippled so a bit" against a team "that just wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel that we could get a counter-goal, "says Daut.
To his chagrin, however, as a spectator, one didn't feel as if his team could score a goal.
For that, the performance was too tenuous.
Reckenfelder Thanksgiving Market: Luckily, there are enough Kreimers
This is delighted for Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder table issuer for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, while the place was still a bit empty, but that was still to change during the day.
Because: "Here it's so beautifully sociable, that's why we're here today," "said one visitor.
Organiser of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus greeted the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a neat pinch of humour.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be outweighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has fallen ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "substitute" did not allow itself to entertain the growing number of visitors musically in between.
That went down so well that at the late hour some folk songs were sung along.
"Just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is delighted with the many active with their stands, including predominantly clubs.
"Actually, there shouldn't be anything like a plaque at all," he nonetheless thanked him for the men's choir's action.
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of everyone on duty at the stalls and also included the other festivities and the "clean up" action, which took place in September.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful coat of paint-here goes something.
Then the Maikranz was taken down by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarters.
Many stalls worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to savoury, everything was to be had.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, got creative on his decorative saw.
He had veneer works, beer lids with Reckenfeld motifs and a lot more on offer.
Three Reckenfelder beekeepers offered a specialty: "Reckenfelder Honig," brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschhatter.
The latter still has a specialty with it.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to access it again and again, so good did the cake taste.
The conviviality is what made the visitors linger long into the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubricant with local political message: No successful advertising of a skate system
In Lengerich, unknowns have promoted the construction of a skate plant in a hardly conducive way.
There are lubricants in several places, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" are emblazoned on signs, among other things, at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Halle, reports that a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign to the Gempt-Bistro had already been discovered after the professional election fair on 19 September.
Since the short message at that time was apparently left "only" with an edding, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, however, this stood again, this time sprayed on," says Rottmann.
He expects the appropriate advertising sign to need to be replaced.
This case is a special feature because several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate system is built, its realization is also to be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.
It is quite possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate systems.
After the old one at the LWL clinic was dismantled, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
The council eventually voiced a majority in favour of the fire brigade car park.
However, this request was not implemented-too many factors apparently spoke against construction at this point.
A U-turn followed at the end of June.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School site.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word then, he said, was the city council.
He said he expected a decision this year, so a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Air traffic control bottleneck gets worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, told the German Press Agency ahead of the October 5 aviation summit in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations, he said, is the long-known staffing shortage in European air traffic control, for which there is no quick fix.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the year ahead, but training new pilots takes four to five years," the unionist said.
Across Europe, he said, the market for fully trained pilots is empty swept.
Around a hundred people were missing from central Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized the fact that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city on Friday, federal, state, air traffic control, airline and airport officials are meeting to address the root causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compaction and overtime, you won't be able to do that without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the federally owned German Air Traffic Control.
Maas again blamed EU Commission guidelines for the pilot misery.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low, he said.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings in national air traffic control are now fully based on the operating business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to lobby in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut the air even further" for air traffic control.
At present, the EU requirements are being voted on by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is under constant lobbying pressure from airlines, he said.
"Ryanair chief executive Michael O 'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas opined.
He hoped the high cost of delays at airlines ushered in a rethink.
The GdF will only help improve the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," Maas said.
The previously announced intake of 120 pilot students every year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary personnel build-up is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes in favour of group restructuring
Members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of plans to remodel the group.
According to the wishes of interim Thyssenkrupp chief executive Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed chief executive at Sunday's meeting, the crisis-stricken group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are said to be based in Essen and listed on the stock market.
There is no going to be any additional staff cuts beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two resignations, the control board on the capital side counts only eight heads.
This is opposed by ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to make a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 percent stake from the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssencomp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence at demos of police and Catalan independence supporters.
There have been violent clashes with scores of injured in two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona.
According to the city government, about 3000 police officers from across Spain gathered on Saturday, as about 6000 independence supporters also demonstrated.
Catalan police have been using a large lineup to try to keep the two protest moves away from each other, he said.
But according to emergency crews, independence supporters repeatedly tried to break the security cordon.
They would have attacked the officials with paint and throwing bullets.
According to the data, there were also Ranggeleien pistes between the participants of the various protest movements.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
Police said there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The policemen had wanted to pay tribute with their demonstration to the colleagues who had taken action almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which had been banned by Spain's central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and Civil Guard find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators found it provocative that the Spanish policemen demonstrated in Barcelona, of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" Catalan protester Manel Perez, 55, asked AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drowning us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, dismissed the allegation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who only did their duty last year: Defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because this is a big European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues, however, "did not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Glitch allowed access to personal data of UK ministers
A security flaw on a mobile phone app has left the personal details of ministers and MPs from Britain's Conservative Tory party temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the glitch came to light a day before the Tory party conference in Birmingham.

Football: Juve coach praises after top role: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker had "played the best game that night along with the half-hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champion's 3:1 (1:1) win over SSC Naples.
For the trainer, even without his own goal, the expensively shopped star was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and does it well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good on our first goal-and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal templates, Juve turned the game around after the early backlog through the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung off the worst pursuer for now.
The goal chunter brought in by Real Madrid initially put on former Bundesliga pro Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26th/49th).
And Ronaldo also did the groundwork to hit defensive boss Leonardo Bonucci (76th) after a corner by header, who only had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," the coach praised.
Yet Allegri, of course, also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and Portugal's national team.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach urged.
Best Juve goalscorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits-Ronaldo has three in the account.
By shopping Ronaldo for more than € 100m, Juventus ' supremation looks set to become even more crushing.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless streak in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the previous seven years already has six points clear of Naples.
The table second, coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the place reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58th) the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to get off the pitch with yellow-red after getting in too hard against Paulo Dybala.
"We played well against a good Naples," the Turin coach commented.
Emre Can was also able to feel addressed.
The Germany international has prevailed at Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool FC, has been in action at all seven league games.
The midfield actor also played in the champions-League match against Valencia, which Allegri meant by the "half-hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the Turin's 2:0 win and is banned for Tuesday's home game against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With one particularly quirky appearance, rapper Kanye West has commanded attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" over the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among onlookers.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change just in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, may he only be called "Ye," according to the musician.
"The being formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted, echoing the late singer Prince as the latter ditched his stage name.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with radio station KRRL, the artist had declared that "Ye" had a religious meaning to him.
"I think" Ye "is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means" you, "" according to the rapper.
Football: District League A1 Münster: Finally!
whacked!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was just more grippy, we hardly ever posed him with problems. ' The list of Hoetmar bullet options reads correspondingly thin.
Grade times two scoring chances in 90 minutes, so you can rarely make games positive.
Football Circle League A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photograph: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first round, but the first took advantage of Maik Krause from an acute angle to the early lead (7th).
In the 43rd minute Steffen could have raised Uphus, but after great groundwork from Krause he was free-standing.
The hosts only had a double opportunity when Moritz Höne failed at Torsteher Jos shoemaker and Jan Blome also found his master in the sending horster keeper in the aftermath Jan Blome.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all awarded.
Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use a trading meter-Louis Kortenjann had saved by hand on the goal line and saw red for it-for the guests (75th).
It wasn't until Nils Berheide poked the ball over the line that the game was decided (81st).
"We had been harshly critical of each other before, which was different today than in the last few weeks," was Florian Kraus's conclusion.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher-Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th of Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7th), 0:2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: District League A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachyds: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to make of it," he urged words.
"We didn't get access to them at all." By that he presumably meant the wing tongs with Colby McGill and Janis Kroeger, but also all the other green-whites who stood out with collective offensive urge.
He could laugh anyway: "A dirty win," he said, cheering cheekily and pulling from dannen His players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for class preservation.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"This was by far our best performance of the season," he says.
' How we come back after the 0:2, how we hold against it over the entire game time against one of the league's top teams, that's been really phenomenal. '
It is all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top goal hunter Lars Zymner put the hosts in the lead (24th) with his 12th goal of the season.
He needed exactly two ball contacts in that game for that goal.
He put the 2:0 on the left side exemplary for Fabian Fröhning (39th).
We knew that, but you can't take a player like that out completely.
"That was madness, what he did," Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of the opponent envious.
Just before the side change, his own elf managed the equaliser: McGill's free-kick from the left sailed through between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long goal corner (45th).
After the side change, it was McGill again who scored the equaliser (59th).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a cracking, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked yachts again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalised (69th).
Despite the overcount, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80th) again.
We must now turn our full focus to Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we need to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg-Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mills-Kroeger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill-Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74./Albachs).
Football: TSV Strasbourg mountain fights point against Primus

Media: Total Presidium of Dynamo Dresden resignation
The entire presidium of football second division Dynamo Dresden has resigned according to media reports.
Several media outlets agreed in the evening on a joint letter from the Saxony panel.
There was no confirmation from the club at first.
The reason for the withdrawal is said to be internal infighting at the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
Good thing he's gone again.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as Recep Tayyip Erdogan's.
The Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many had thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing is offering about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signalled he wants to pick up the tolerance price in person in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term was too short: As president, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
For example, academy director Udo Hahn credited him with saying proudly: "All the federal presidents and chancellors were already with us." However, the fact that celebrities keep appearing at the academy at Tutzing Castle was also a topic when presenting the annual programme.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker attends a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, on September 29 the writer Frido Mann is at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged: He wants to receive the "tolerance prize" awarded to him by the Academy in person in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The 80 or so meetings up to mid-2019 have it all.
"The pension is not safe!" Is written in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders"-this is how the academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting on Syria:" Barbarism without a limit. "
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death-war makes a mockery of any humane idea. "
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change in work through digitisation.
Academy Director Hahn expressed himself as convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions, or at least for partial solutions."
At a meeting marking the 200th anniversary of the Council of Ministers.
Karl Marx's birthday will soon be expected by some visitors to the direction of criticism of capitalism, others more of a tendency "from left-winger to the middle."
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we're not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart-Wolbeck-Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret expert, Teubner buttoned up gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
She used the mini guitar and also mastered her violin.
Sitting at the wing was Ben Süverkrüp.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to the point until the end of the sentence, on the other hand a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanied by Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wanted a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely how it fit the red thread of the evening.
Teufel had brought a paradox into play: The satisfaction with the man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: What would have come from composing Mozart had "the Nannerl" opened the door unexpectedly?
So Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt full of blood and wounds" into the "Song of Death," and from Mozart G minor Symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Blumen presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, to the Chansonette.
But chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not let any additional thanks be taken away.
She had the idea of begging the duo to one in Wolbeck in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk is allowed to remain chief executive at electric car Tesla, but must relinquish the chairmanship of the board of directors.
Musk also agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pay a double-digit million-dollar penalty, the SEC announced.
The backdrop is Musk's surprise announcement in August that he wants to take Tesla off the stock market.
The SEC accused Musk in its lawsuit of making false and misleading statements in the process.
Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, police have slightly revised down the number of victims.
There were 10 passengers, each of 15, slightly injured, he said.
All have since been released from hospital, he said.
The French bus driver had remained in hospital for a night out for a night.
He will be fired later in the day, a police spokesman said.
The cause of the accident of the long-distance bus near Bruchsal is still unclear.
The bus had been crashing unchecked head-on against a guardrail on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women's state league: Ahlener SG narrowly retains white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlenerinnen had problems especially with third-division player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten hits.
' Actually I was well satisfied with the defence, only one player has made too many goals.
We didn't get a grip on them, "said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But that fretted more about the many boisterous chances.
The concentration in the conclusion left his squad missing this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end behind a backlog, was at the back for the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45th).
It was only towards the end that the wider bench of hostesses made a decisive presence of attention.
In addition, Aydogdu placed back room Merle Klement on left winger, who then "extremely cleverly made the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Bush-core gods, Bolte-Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd division West.
At the second division drop-off VC Allbau Essen, the blue whites won with 3:1.
' That's been a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
That's what we've now come to terms with, "trainer Dominik Münch rejoiced after an almost impeccable performance from his team at the ousted leader.
The first pass was dominated by the guests almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the runner-up of the previous year with 25:15.
Food has accepted in the two-man bar but has not come into play.
We kept them well busy.
Our opponent has pitched at high risk, but has also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen switched the assumption to three bars.
We couldn't keep the impact pressure.
Food sucked in, and we let ourselves be a bit lulled, "Münch continued.
At 18:17, the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had the edge for the first time.
Although Ostbevern still repelled four set balls at the 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," found the practice leader at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly with their offers to the BSV turning the tide in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly."
Over 7:3 and 15:13 brought the Blue White Passage four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the manner of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's inauguration of the grand Ditib mosque in Cologne.
"The mosque opening in Cologne has left a pile of shards in German-Turkish relations that can only be painstakingly brought together," TGD chairman Gökay Sofuoglu told the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance for a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of underscoring, side by side with German leaders, Muslims ' affiliation with Germany, Erdogan has used the appointment for his purposes," Sofuoglu lamented.
The widespread exclusion of the German public had "reinforced many reservations."
Hometown club Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break is folksat time again.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7.30 pm, the hometown club Nottuln is already hosting its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Old Amtmannei.
Almost to the day, it's been a year since we first did a folk meeting.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln, "says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk meeting is establishing itself so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether it's Stormlow Friederike in January or the heat wave in July, the Kamin Room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next folk meeting is, as always, a colorful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites musicians who are friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has promised his accordion for the first folk meeting "birthday."
He was a member for many years at "Gaitling," a group from the neighboring district of Steinfurt that played music with platform German lyrics.
Now he's out with an Irish folk band.
The creators of the folk meeting fondly remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten wowed the audience with his international version of the song "Frogs at Night" and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many cheerful guests to once again spend a convivial and humorous evening," the home club's invitation reads.
Those who play an instrument and feel like getting actively involved are invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always quickly occupied, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The folk meeting starts at 7.30pm, but admission is as early as 7pm.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
Frankfurt-Linde and Praxair are taking another step forward on their way to becoming the world's largest industrial gases company.
China's competition regulator approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
As a result, permits in South Korea and-as the biggest hurdle-in the US are still outstanding for the multibillion-dollar merger.
Most recently, according to an insider, the chances of agreeing there had improved because Linde has pledged to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and state maintenance was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger Hall.
On September 29, 1893, a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus set the last start-up impulses for the district association for horticulture and state maintenance Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
To be sure, it was called differently at the time: As the "District Iphestuus Association Kulmbach Stadt and Land," he was founded by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit building club was also different from today's work-it was actually purely about fruit growing, no one thought about flowers and horticulture at the time.
"At that time, in the Enlightenment era, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained district keeper Günter Dippold in his festive lecture.
Fruit trees were supposed to line trunk roads, and schools were so-called industrial gardens.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural clubs in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But that far from exhausted, the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A near-natural horticulture, biological crop protection, village embellishment and nutrition play as important a role as imparting knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutshdorf youth group "moles" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said county chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature to life.
Chestnut collecting was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Councillor Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides," added Councillor Söllner, highlighting the special importance of horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county also left Friedman Haun district managing director and expert advisor in no doubt.
He led the many visitors with an image lecture through the long history of the district association and reported, among other things, on the necessity of self-sufficiency after the war.
It used to all come from the garden, for winter it was dosed in.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden had turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature endures, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves on it," pleaded the specialist for fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is an incentive for the horticultural clubs not to let up so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This would include welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added the president of the Bavarian state association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the glaring decline in insects, we owe that to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif, the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower blowers of the Thurnau music club.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada's foreign minister moves UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: They are giving both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister is now giving absolute priority to the trade deal-and postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Because of time pressure in wrangling over a reshuffle of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the U.S. and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the U.N. general debate in New York.
Instead of today's Saturday, the minister will not address the United Nations General Assembly until Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen announced.
In the meantime, she is focused on renegotiating Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo had said on Friday that Canadian and US negotiators would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually joined the trade deal already reached between his country and the US wool.
The U.S. and Mexico had agreed in August to rewrite the regional free trade agreement Nafta.
Us President Donald Trump hinted that Canada could be barred from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a reshuffle have been going on for over a year.
They are now due to be finalised by Sunday night (local time), with Trump's administration looking to present the settlement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of negotiations failing, Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador had announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he resides, according to a report by the O Globo daily newspaper.
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the final week ahead of the South American country's presidential election.
The politician had been attacked on the open street during a campaign rally in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in English: "The not"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
Also on social networks, the associations made racist and misogynistic statements mobile against Bolsonaro's questioning.
Several thousand protesters were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally by Brazilian Workers ' Party (PT) presidential candidate Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run.
Brazil's presidential election is on October 7.
As the ex-mayor of the megacity of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in political operations for a long time, but has recently presented himself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieve an outright majority in the first round of voting, there will be a run-off on 28 October.
Observers believe Bolsonaro will not emerge from this one successfully-no matter who he competes against.
Bolsonaro is known for rushing against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Time and again, he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time, he said supporters of Lula's left-wing Labor Party should be shot.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen shared on Larsen's website.
At the deathbed, he said, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known to the band Gasolin ', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts."
The head of government also recalled that monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared at the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rock night at shoe factory: Volume at compress air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a rewrite of the rocking live music experience on Saturday night in the hall of the Civic Centre shoe factory: Pure hard rock by three bands who are friends with each other.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert starts, the musicians even make time for a group photo.
There is no trace of stage fright.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area-all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde-and their bands loudly inspire the 120 or so visitors to the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band's coherent and punchy interplay will be danced.
Although "encore" calls cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand."
Guarrist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that Hardrock is not the same as hard rock with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers," "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the yearning, downright ballaad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rockriffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, meanwhile, has gained a special reputation since its founding in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their hard rock on Saturday.
That "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience-recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China-is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also sets his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
On the occasion, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo at the felt higher sound than before, walking through the audience.
A certain volume is, of course, part of it at such a hard rock concert due to genre-related: At the "Mint Mosquito"-Rocknacht, according to the information of the mixing desk team, the three-way concert of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98. Decibels.
This is about at the level of compressed air hammer, but is thus still well below the controls of the "Wacken Fesitval," which "The Ignition" on its website point to.
Deafening 120 decibels in jet engine volume as usual at the annual metal pitch in the north of the republic, however, does not need the Ahlener audience on this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands have long since won over the harder, rocking gait with their sovereign, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, figuratively figuratively, can say at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in glider accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
There has been a fatal accident at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
A glider crashed in a car park at Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
There was a fatal accident near Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider had crashed in the exhibition slot at the airport.
The pilot died in the process, he said.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was on board alone-the airman is said to be a single-seater.
The aircraft was already in the landing approach at the time of the accident.
The crash site is not far from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been held since this weekend.
The airport Mülheim/Essen is located on the city limits of the two towns of Ruhr and directly at the driveway to the 52 motorway.
From the parking lot there is a Park & Ride offer at large events at the Essen trade fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump heavens Kim: ' And then we fell in love '
That North Korea's US president Kim is thoroughly well-disposed despite nuclear crisis is no secret.
Now, though, Trump has made an outright declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has pledged allegiance to a new flame.
The tragedy: It's a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-so old scion of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, though it is proving to be quite tough chunks in the struggle over North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was hard-hitting, so was he, and between us it went back and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Ok?
No, really.
And it wasn't just the conversations with Kim that would have made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne red politically, he said: Trump pointed to the halt to all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even if critics behind them so far see little more than lip service.
That the affection for whether his martial threatening gestures infamous "Rocket Man"-Trump's nickname for Kim-may not be hassby to everyone seemed perfectly aware of the US president.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism of it at his appearance in a major sports hall of the city of Wheeling right away: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How awful, how awful is that?
This is so unpresidential.
He cares very little, though, Trump explained, then pointed his index finger at the crowd: "I've always told you, it's so easy to be presidential."
But then out there wouldn't push 10,000 people into this bulging arena, but we'd only have 200 people standing outside.

Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a cellphone video to point out their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya, enabling them to be rescued.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July, at the risk of their lives, and circulated it online.
"They refuse to send us back," one man in the video message said.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The recording was sent to the France 24 Observers website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"We probably wouldn't have been able to go back to Nigeria without the video," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old had been detained in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he put himself in mortal danger, according to his own account.
One of his fellow guards was nearly beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM is organising the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their homeland this year using the program, IOM spokesman in the West African country Jorge Galindo said.
The case of the Nigerians now rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor prison conditions in Libya, he said.
So far, however, he has not heard of a call for help via mobile phone video.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in Libya's refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants en route from Africa to Europe.

German was trapped in own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to endure several days and nights in his car in a wooded area in central Franconia after getting stuck the van away from all forest paths and a tree blocking the car door.
Rescue workers discovered the car by chance not far from a pasture on Saturday afternoon and freed the missing person since Tuesday night, police announced on Sunday.
The 75-year-old, from Pleinfeld, was in good health condition despite the cold nights and the long time without care, according to the claims.
He indicated he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after failing to return from a ride on his SUV across the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intense search measures, the man's whereabouts had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
Cologne North Rhine-Westphalia Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU), speaking to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he was urging the rule of law in Turkey.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said Saturday after meeting Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This mainly concerns waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He therefore made it clear with Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this. "
Laschet also said he was addressing the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He had formulated the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then again emphasized the independence of the Turkish judiciary, he said.
Laschet and Erdogan's conversation had been moved at short notice to a building of the German Defense Ministry's flight readiness at Cologne airport.
It was originally supposed to take place at Wahn Castle-but the owners of the castle had rejected this against Erdogan out of political conviction.
Erdogan continued to travel to the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne after the conversation.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance at the structure.
But he said: "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their point of contact-and not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in US: North Korea makes call for disarmament
While US President Trump never tires of emphasizing the successes in negotiating the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime represents the situation more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for Washington to be accommodated.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government at the U.N. general debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The latest gridlock comes as the U.S. is building on coercive measures that are deadly to confidence building," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances, he said.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way we are the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat elaborated.
That punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" was "a pipe dream of people who don't know us."
To build trust, however, his country has halted its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri pointed out.
However, there have been no "corresponding reactions" from the US side to this, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the U.N. Security Council had adopted sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
Us President Donald Trump and his secretary of state Mike Pompeo pushed for strict compliance with punitive measures at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump had first met North Korea's ruler, Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang again for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The HoT served: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually on a youth meeting, the many visitors to the HoT open door house got nothing with it: White blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The youngsters of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then, on the first day after the summer break, came the nasty surprise: A power outage had put the huge, two-piece fridge out of service, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: We got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the kids and young people wanted to do it alone," says Westbuer.
And so everyone attacked along.
The result was impressive, the guests were thrilled.
"Chefs can't do it any better either," praised one visitor impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to serve themselves on quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the kids and teens have put on their feet," the Rev. Frank Beckmann insisted, while magician Stephan Lammen caused astonishment with card tricks and other pieces of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state executive NRW of the board
Out of frustration at criticism from within his own ranks, the head of the Essen panel, Jörg Sartor, has relinquished his post in the state association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen panel had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He resigned as vice chief of NRW panels back in July, Sartor told "Welt am Sonntag."
Too many fell in my back.
The head of the NRW Table National Association, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed an understanding to the dpa for the decision of his long-time deputy.
The sharp criticism was taken by Sartor, he said.
' I can understand his move-people who didn't even know exactly why the Essen panel was doing it. '
But Sartor is still active for the Essen panel-"six days a week, nothing changes," according to Weilerswist.
In "Welt am Sonntag," Sartor again criticized criticism of colleagues from other panels.
One must not take the approach "without us the people of the city starve to death."
It was up to the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essen man did not attend a congress of panels in Berlin on Friday.
"I'm told too much sweet schmus there," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis, who also criticized me so much at the time.
SF Lorch squander 2:0 lead-Gmünder Tagespost
Football, District League Lorch loses to newcomer 2:3-TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after backlog-Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0, Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV newcomer-in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment among the sports friends was great.
The TV Heuchlingen is quite different: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1, but after 90 minutes it won with 2:1. Meanwhile, at the top of the table, the SGB was able to use a 3:0
Gladbach squander two-run lead-Schalke without Embolo with first win
Borussia Monchengladbach will have to keep waiting for an away win at Wolfsburg.
In the 2:2, the Foals squander a lead twice.
Schalke progress to their first win of the season against Mainz (1:0).
(sda) Four times Schalke have maneuvered themselves to the sidelines with early goals in their first five league games.
Now Domenico Tedesco's team again showed the strength with which they had finished first behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf put the home quipe in the lead per capita in the 11th minute after strong groundwork from Yevgeny Konopljanka, as a result the hosts conserved the mini-pair with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund are now greeting from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had finished a 0:2 behind against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but they were still in the 4:2 victory in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalised with a doublette within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was substituted by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided another doublette in the closing stages (86th/94th) for the crowning conclusion of the Performance enhancement after the break.
The first victory was also achieved by VfB Stuttgart.
Against that because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic already decimated before the break Werder Bremen had to worry in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious earned-in own goal that helped the guests equalise in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to its first victory.
At Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a fully successful but also not a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher, who competed with Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, twice gave a lead, ultimately played 2:2 and have been waiting for an away win at VW City since 2003.
Wolfsburg's compensation for 1:1 was in charge of Renato Steffen with his second Bundesliga.
In the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, as was the second counter-goal after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa is increasingly proving to be a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase, which came from OGC Nice, hit for the third year in a row and seventh in the seventh mandatory game.
After seven laps, Gladbach takes 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen manoeuvred themselves into an uncomfortable position against VfB Stuttgart.
After 19 minutes Florian Kohlfeldt's team were surprised by a Stuttgart counter whom the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first goal of the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: The 23-year-old Serbian cashed in after A jersey plucker against Daniel Didavi yellow-red.
Although Stuttgart's defenders Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremen back into the game through a curious throwing in own goal (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the overspeaking Stuttgart native back on the winning road.
Nuremberg confidently won the duel against Dusseldorf 3:0.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens put the home team on track by means of Foulfpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia today, around 1.8 million citizens vote on whether to change their country's name in northern Macedonia.
A yes vote could resolve the conflict with neighbour Greece, which is simmering for nearly three decades.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name, blocking any approach by Macedonia to the West.
Voters are therefore also deciding on future western integration.
The US had announced the country could quickly become a NATO member if the referendum had a positive outcome.
Syrians in U-custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat up three pensioners, seriously injuring them in some cases.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted in the Escape Road in Alsergrund at around 10pm on Friday.
When the cops arrived, they addressed his behaviour to the accused, who walked off on passers-by with clenched fists and tried to attack them.
As a result, the Syrian tried to punch and kick the officials.
A little later, it emerged that shortly before, the suspect had punched three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) to the ground with his fists in Währinger Strasse at a tram stop.
He had also kicked the trio with his feet.
The retirees were, in some cases, seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for as a result of the unknown cause," as police were told.
He was taken to hospital and monitored throughout treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the jawort in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the Bild newspaper.
"If we get married, then right." He had been with his partner for 25 years, he said.
Kahrs, 55, is the SPD parliamentary spokesman and one of the spokesmen for the Maritime Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on opening marriage to gay people, Kahrs had caused a stir with a rage speech on June 30, 2017.
For example, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the issue.
"That was your schabovsky moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as on adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was quite a lot of work in front of the members of the Citizens ' Association Children's House and the Society for Leprakunde.
Because around 400 metres of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for around twelve supporters.
"We're doing this to reduce costs," explained Citizens Association Chairman Walter Schröer.
And there has been a lot of accumulating.
Due to the hot summer, we're late this time, but thankfully it's now just a shape-cut.
Because already in the spring the hedge had already been shorn.
The breakfast that always follows on the work has also had a long tradition.
"After all, everyone should stick to their strength," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner takes gold at Kanuslalom World Cup
Augsburg's Hannes Aigner has won the gold medal at the conclusion of the Kanuslalom World Championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old put on a perfect run on the Olympic circuit on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here on the complex and everything was right today, "said the London 2012 Olympic third.
On target, he threw away his paddle with joy and stretched both arms soaring with victory-knowing it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had starting number four.
But the six remaining starters couldn't top his Fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was Czech Jiri Prskavec ahead of Russian Pawel Eigel.
Police Inspectorate Gauting reports this autumn's first burglary attempt into a single-family home.
Thankfully, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter-burglars want to take advantage of that again.
So the Police Inspectorate Gauting reported this autumn's first burglary attempt yesterday.
The alarm system is due to the alarm system that it stayed on the detached house on Königswieser Strasse.
That started when the perpetrators put on a hand just before 8pm on Friday.
The burglars did suspect that residents were not home.
The alarm system apparently surprised them so much that they took flight without prey.

Pleite at Hertha: Henged by reality: Bayern demanded against Ajax
The title is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin the FC Bayern "does not want to let itself be liked."
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for Niko Kovac's tenure.
The first small performance event under the new coach Niko Kovac is not supposed to increase for the Munich residents to the larger autumnal low.
"A week ago you still had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a bit of reality has caught up with us, "Thomas Müller noted after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC, calling for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are giving gas towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year away no own goal scored, as at the same time of the pre-season two mandatory games in series without a win, the standings in the Bundesliga lost for the time being to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall situation may not be as dramatic as it was at the final stage of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its rampant man-on-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle bites across the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last overpowering Bavarians are to be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know we won't let this please us and we will do everything we can to make us successful again," Kovac insisted.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his city of birth and merely pushed his first defeat as Munich coach to the again deficient handling of opportunities.
A win against Amsterdam and against Borussia Monchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim conclusion of his term positive before the international break-otherwise the tone is likely to tighten.
So Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before this season's second pre-class appearance after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After Sunday's day off, as planned, the short preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax begins, which had also confidently defeated aek Athens with 3:0 to kick off aek Athens.
"Now it's caught us in two games but we'll be doing our goals again as well," national team captain Manuel Neuer announced.
As was the case after the losing cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua kimmich spoke plainly.
The right-wing defender appeared in the role as a reminder.
"I don't think this is all bad luck, we have to work it out again as well because we don't make the variety of chances and make the mistakes at the back," insisted the 23-year-old just before departing from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh matchday of the previous season, the Bavarians were already ahead with five points behind Dortmund, who have now taken the lead again with a point advantage.
And so Kimmich rated at least positively with a twinkle in his eye that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in firing line: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan to Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes but defends the association line.
A new post is now to be created.
Berlin-On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the power of interpretation in the permanent subject of the dispute Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
Early on Sunday morning, the Grindel, personally sharply attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the Causa in Mainz's ZDF "sports studio."
"In the future-because we also have a lot of players with a migrant background in the U-teams-we have to draw very close conclusions that something like this does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants a national player with no immigrant background as a Winning further integration officers.
At the same time, Grindel again declared that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had denounced, in sharp terms, a racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they had their picture taken with me in England, "Erdogan said in the cathedral city on Saturday.
Frankly, as their president, I couldn't stomach that our two young men, who have ascended to the German national team, have been edged out.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he had felt "sensibly treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun through photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced his intention to put himself in front of players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant-you can't.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
But he also does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a conclusion, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed alongside Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without an immigrant background clearly works into society and football and says," The issue is important, we have to take care of that, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration Must work, "Grindel said.
Despite criticism of his person following the World Cup end and the Özil affair, he plans to run for DFB president again next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying hard to do it as well as it gets," Grindel said.
-Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental-As police report, the 75-year-old caused Friday's accidents between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Initially, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the Lauterer Height area.
This informed the pensioner that he had been driving against her car.
There was no staff exchange, though, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the car park.
A short time later, a telephone message was received to police about a motorist who would have veered off the road and driven against a lead post.
Asked about this, the man did not want police on the scene and subsequently drove away.
After that, the Roman painter drove home.
However, the pensioner has gone about his way in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and rammed a construction vehicle while turning away.
Eventually, police were able to find him and stop him.
His car had significant accidental damage.
The 75-year-old made a tangled impression and couldn't remember much more.
The damage is approximately 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 emergency crews are still in use.
About four weeks after the bog fire broke out at a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 emergency crews are still engaged in the extinguishing work.
That's what the Bundeswehr announced on Sunday.
As, according to a spokesman, the situation continues to develop in a stable manner, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of emergency crews is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster case, declared a good week earlier on September 21, had been lifted amid fears that the flames from wind and spark flight were putting adjacent forests and settlements at risk.
It was then said on Thursday that there was no longer any threat of a spillover of the fire into adjoining communities.
At times, more than 1500 emergency crews tried to get the major fire under control on the ground.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "tornadoes" are also planned for October 2 and 5.
The blaze had been sparked by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand had at times moved up to a hundred kilometres far beyond northwestern Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr plans to set up an appeal point that will receive damage reports.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Catherine in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician has married his long-term friend in Hamburg.
The pair have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg-Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the jawort in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the Bild newspaper.
If we get married, then right.
He had been with his partner for 25 years, he said.
Kahrs, 55, is the SPD parliamentary spokesman and one of the spokesmen for the Maritime Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on opening marriage to gay people, Kahrs had caused a stir with a rage speech on June 30, 2017.
For example, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the issue.
"That was your schabovsky moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as on adoption law.
Referendum started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the much-anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called Northern Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province of the same name, the neighbour Greece.
As a bargaining chip, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and Nato for nearly three decades.
If the citizens vote ' yes ', they will also give the go-ahead for their country's Western integration.
Elie Wiesel-The author who saves the Shoah from oblivion
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the US in 2016, leaving behind a work that preserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that institutions can continue to be removed only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant points out.
(AP) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved from Swisstransplant if required.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that institutions can continue to be removed only with explicit consent, as in Germany, Swisstransplant points out.
15 percent of Swiss people are thought to have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five per cent of cases is a card found at the crucial moment in possible donors, he said.
In over 60 percent of the conversations, relatives do not know the deceased's desire.
"They then have to decide vicariously in the sense of the deceased, which is often very stressful," says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations of storing information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman for the Federal Centre for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"There is no register where people can register their wishes-pro or counter organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has advocated a new regulation of organ donation.
Under his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor unless he or loved ones object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old pupil is world champion in head arithmetic
14-year-old schoolboy Tomohiro Iseda of Japan is a world leader in head arithmetic.
He beat 39 fellow strugglers at Wolfsburg at the weekend.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue for the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Greeting from Germany finished third.
The youngest World Cup participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old retiree from France, lead referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks have included: 14,130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
With viewers not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, with contestants competing against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Greetings from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greeting was already present in Bielefeld two years ago as a 14-year-old at the time.
With terms like superbrain, genius or prodigy, organizer Laue can do little.
"Head arithmetic can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced for several hours a day.
There are even stadia-oriented computational competitions in India or Singapore, he said.
Disciplines include squaring rooting from six-figure figures.
When calculating diversity, candidates get surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans also have a good chance here, the main referee said.
Otherwise, Asians are often an advantage, because they already learn to work intensively and with other, effective methods in early childhood.
Haunting appeal: Video featuring naked Serena Williams: It's all about breast cancer early detection
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows off her soulful and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer with this video and push for early detection.
It's about life and death, but it's also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" topless-only her hands obscure her most intimate spots.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died from it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which involves breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams would have nearly died herself a year ago.
There were complications in the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
A distress op has been launched to save the baby's life.
In the event of a subsequent CT, lumps of blood were then discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time ...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna-The federal government is planning a significant expansion of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill on the so-called "symbols law" in review.
The aim is to significantly expand the number of terrorist or comparable groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow on the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes out her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists from the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 metres at the start of the week-in tight belts it could snow down to about 1,000 metres at high intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzer Forest to the High Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Biel altitude, Brenner Pass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Grossglockner High Alpine Road), road conditions are therefore wintry.
Farmers will be allowed to start annual buckling care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers will be allowed to start annual buckling care on Monday.
The "green ramparts" that are unique in Germany have shaped the landscape of the wooded state for about 200 years.
The tree and scrub hedges, which are up to five metres wide, are "forest sets" and the last retreat rooms for many animals and plants.
Knicks connect habitats scattered as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the chief executive of the conservation federation Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were defeated on the basis of a 1766 order from Danish King Christian VI, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundary and cattle fence, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
From that time comes his name "kink": By "buckling" the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, around 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a cobred, multi-faceted landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a substitute habitat by around 7000 animal species.
In one kilometre of kink, up to 1800 different species could live and up to 30 pairs of birds could breed.
However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Otherwise, it atrophies into a light row of trees, which loses its wind protection effect in addition to biodiversity, Ludwichowski said.
The buckling care is only allowed to operate outside the breeding season from October to March, according to the Department of Agriculture.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesians talks about SItuation on site
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the spot on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on site during the tsunami itself?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
That's when I arrived on Sunday morning because I still had to drive more than 20 hours of driving after a flight, as the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which are completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are staying in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people partly steal food and gasoline.
The civil service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the inmates are partially walking around freely and finding them is difficult.
There are still a lot of bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information on the island work?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that it didn't work and we only got information over the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people they don't know if they live and where they are because people were out during the earthquakes not at home but on the job, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami"-and then it came after all.
In other regions not hit by the tsunami, there has been the misinformation that a tsunami is hitting the region and they have run out on the surrounding mountains.
Isn't an island like Sulawesi, which sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, prepared for earthquakes?
Yet, there are earthquakes every day, but this one was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a great many people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must give up Aogo and donis for a long time
Anastasios donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing VfB Stuttgart with serious muscle injuries for long periods of time.
Aogo contracted a muscle fiber tear in his back left thigh at the 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football Bundesliga player announced on Sunday.
In donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle tear in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and are likely to miss games even after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast of downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of hyperrealism at San Sebástian film festival
San Sebastián-With the Film Festival of San Sebastián, the ranks of the most prestigious European festivals close annually.
Despite all the chants of cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 has been a remarkable year for the film.
After a compelling contest in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that could attract plenty of attention with Oscar-winning candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best contests in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching Fire Department attempted to capture an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching-Walkers on Lake Olchinger noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the area of the water watch station.
To help the animal, passersby called the police and fire brigade.
The first attempts to capture the duck, however, went awry.
Despite the injury, she was able to repeatedly dodge emergency crews.
She ended up fleeing to the lake.
Using a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and push it back to shore, where it was then put into a transport box by a firefighter with a brave handle after nearly an hour.
The duck, injured in the chest, was then taken to the LMU's veterinary clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But according to initial assessments, their chances of survival are rather slim.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard targets World Cup medal
Fourth place at Olympia was biathlete Julian Eberhard long in the stomach.
Next winter, the Saalfeldener wants to make up for the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The final shot cost the 31-year-old in Pyeongchang's Olympic sprint the medal close to the grasping.
Seven tenths of a second were missing out on bronze at the end.
"I deliberately gave myself time to process that," Eberhard says at the MyGym gym opening in his hometown of Saalfelden.
One medal was the goal, I was on top form but it just didn't want to be.
All the more motivated is the Pinzgauer to catch up on the failed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a big event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point, you have to strike, too.
The World Cup trail in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track to my heart," he remembers with joy his fourth World Cup place in the individual race the previous year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (nous).
With the relay he ran in Oslo (NOR) in second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbot-pace
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation at Turbot-empo, U.S. Senate Republicans want to secure the razor-thin majority for judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial on woodoation charges.
President Donald Trump has given investigators a deadline of Friday to clear up the alleged incidents that have occurred more than 30 years ago.
The latest turnaround in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's appeal, accompanied by a culture battle, had been sparked on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and first accuser Christine Blasey Ford, during which the jurist ejected angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should clear the way for final confirmation The arch-conservative judge on the US supreme court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly, contrary to his original announcement, Senator Jeff Flake declared that while he would agree, he was demanding an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had still called Thursday's heavy allegations "shaming up," initially abstained from further attacks against the women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune."
That way, final doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They're trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
Also, the White House has extremely limited the powers of investigators.
One will specifically investigate the known allegations of two women, nothing more, a government official told The Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on a fishing trip."
Only four witnesses are expected to be heard, according to the New York Times.
The mobile radar of the Ried Municipality, installed in a "civilian vehicle," to monitor the speed limit, is stationed on the Garden Road from Monday, October 1, according to the Municipality.
That's also where the federal school center is located.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after win against Mainz: One has felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the factor of time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen-Meanwhile, it is well known that Christian Heidel is a giant pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
' I've seen every ball in it.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area, "the Schalke 04 sports board said-breathing a sigh of relief.
After all, the royal blue had succeeded in bringing the skimpy 1:0 against the Rhine Hesse over time and thus the first victory of the season.
In fact, things could have turned out differently.
After the lead given by Alessandro Schöpf 11th to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco certainty had given Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playfully and from the pressing.," obviously played more and more with increasing playing time The head a roll.
Do not create a header monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours to me," Heidel said: "If the squad was half as nervous as me on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give that out of their hands and therefore kept withdrawing.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all have fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in this with his head ball goal: "I'm actually the worst head ball player in Manner."
But in the end, only victory matters.
The relief was palpable throughout the arena, including, of course, at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start punchy in the early stages and make fireworks out of it," Schalke's head coach said.
Victory was important.
Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the squad and the fans.
We played smartly, calmly and boldly, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Arguably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Royal blue missed, more likely to worry for clearer circumstances.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the bar 59 ./72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a tremor win," Tedesco opined: "You've already felt the fear a bit."
So I'm glad we won.
With that, he wasn't the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Column of smoke visible in the Leitzachtal 2 km
The smoke was unmissable.
From around two kilometres away, a hiker in the main centre valley observed a fire at around 1.30pm on Sunday.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau-The cause soon found out police and firefighters: An unknown man had lit rubbish on a two-square-foot area at Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it appeared he had been monitoring the fire for an extended period of time, but then left the embers unattended.
And that's close to the forest.
30 Fischbachauer firefighters were busy pulling apart and extinguishing.
Police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on an equal footing
In front of them stands the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has once again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my mission to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfeld Treff"-the association that cooperates with the "Cultural Policy" alliance in hosting the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, tangible numbers and one or the other joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflicted topics: Migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, are conflicts becoming increasingly common?
The Syrian-born author makes use of a metaphor when answering the question.
At one table sits German society, at the cat table the first-generation migrants.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to have a say.
This leads to conflict.
The decisive factor, therefore, is not whether to fit in politically on the right or left, but to: "Am I for or against an open society?" He insists.
At first rather behave, then the discussion round starts more and more lively.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani presides, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: She is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue because "it is only when we understand what the problem that we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing session, he still received an open ear for the questions of the guests and also became, with prepared Kurdish specialties, intensively discussed further.
Basketball: Bonn and casting win kick-off games
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn have ended the first matchday of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home-and-an away win.
Giessen prevailed in a hard-fought game in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the middle German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won at BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first standings of the season is Alba Berlin after Saturday's 112:55 gala against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, German champions Bayern Munich and former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich already struggled to an 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg on Saturday with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 properties
The need is apparently huge: More than 100 interested parties have applied to buy one of the land in Landsh-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the new land area of Landsh-Süd on the open market.
Mayor Roland Frick shares this.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots offered by the municipality on more favourable terms or prices has been completed-similar to the previous local model.
A good 100 applications were received, Frick said.
"Currently, the documents are being examined," with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Pliseningen, the aim is to have created the applicant rankings for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the local council.
According to that, the award could take place.
A total of 50 properties for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four properties for multi-family houses, each with an expected eight residential units.
The development has now been almost completed, with the roads and paths to be paved in the near future.
A single property, as well as two of the apartment buildings, belong to a private individual, the rest of the community of Pliening.
It sells the bulk on the open market, 20 plots in the socially compatible model.
The community's two apartment buildings are to be built as affordable housing, according to Frick.
With a total of 16 earcome-based housing supported by the Free State.
Room for 200 people
Roughly estimated is created on the area of the new construction area Landsh-South housing for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, the start is taking place there for the new construction of a day care center, according to Frick.
It will house three nursery groups and three crib groups, as well as a multi-purpose room.
It is scheduled to open in September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
Here's how Schalke's Naldo ' big sport ' succeeds on the bench too
For the third time in a row not in the starting XI: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen-After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had sat not in the Schalker starting XI for the third year in a row, but on the interchange bench, the understanding would have been great among many people if the almost two-metre-tall Brazilian had really got his hands on the Frustration of the soul would have been.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the centre circle as usual after the 1:0 win over FSV Mainz 05 and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom everyone is the easiest to call Naldo, turned himself in and said; ' We've got to thank, coaches! '
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction to his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reserving existence, held no grudges whatsoever.
Probably Naldo, who was hailed as the best Schalker last season, knows he actually didn't get on the sidelines with his coach-but is given a break for good reason.
A reason called "load control."
It wasn't easy to let him know
"It wasn't easy to let him know that, I'll tell you that in all honesty," Tedesco reported of the moment he had told Naldo he wasn't in the starting XI.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club, "Tedesco justified the move.
Naldo has played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that you can take a breath of things all times at the moment.
And that we keep everyone in the boat, "Tedesco explained of the rotation, which also most recently caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: By also proving to be an exemplary team player on the bench.
Sentiment in Austria's industry continued its downward trajectory in August, accelerating compared to the eurozone.
The Purchasing Managers ' Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low of 46.7 points.
Across Europe, Austria nevertheless has the third-best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone PMI rose 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still below the 50-meter mark for the 13th consecutive month, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked that threshold in August at 50.9 points.
The Greeks (42.1 points) were the final.
In Germany, France and Spain, the sentiment barometer fell, but at a slower pace than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index hit its highest level since March at 44.0 points.
"While the slightly attenuated decline could mean the worst is weathered," Markit economist Rob Dobson said.
But the industry remains-in the third quarter, anyway-the number one drag on growth.
There is no prospect of a rapid return to the growth zone: Euro zone export orders fell as much as they have not since November 2011.

Nice coach Thomas Tuchel continues to rush from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At OGC Nice, the defending champion won with 3:0 (1:0) thanks to two hits from superstar Neymar, making him successful in the eighth league game as well.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon had got such a good start to playing time in France 82 years ago.
Brazilian Neymar put PSG in the lead after 22 minutes and made the final score in added time.
Christopher Nkunku (46th) provided the interim 2:0.
In doing so, Paris also managed the dress rehearsal for the landmark second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
To kick off the premier class, Tuchel's team had suffered the only mandatory game defeat so far this season at the 2:3 in Liverpool.
