Yes, she wants...
Becoming a "beautiful miner" in 2018!
In the afternoon, another surprise awaits our female candidates: they won't fight the romantic candlelight shoot in front of the MY SOLARIS alone, but alongside Male model Fabian!
Hvar - flirting, coquetting, seducing - no easy tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Still, the nine "beautiful minders" contestants deliver at the shoot with people photographer Tuan, braving wind, gish and rain like real professionals.
There's the romantic shoot in the video:
DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for 'zil comeback
Berlin DFB president Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut 'zil to return to the national team.
"That's a question that depends, of course, on getting into the conversation once, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or two things as laid out in his statement," Grindel said in the "Phrase Mowers" football podcast of the Bild newspaper.
Despite the now-months-long debate over the photos of 'zil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-times national.
'I'd have been happy if Mesut xzil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed to some point that would be the case," Grindel said.
De 29-year-old declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it by saying Grindel did not defend him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of 'zil that this was not ready for a conversation with federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure but he knows it from football so when "you leave a team or change a club that you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a shame that this conversation hasn't come about so far."
Linz: Garden hut in shrine settlement burned
At 2.13pm, the Linz Professional Fire Service was alerted to a fire in the Angererhof Way.
Because a high-voltage power line runs directly across the Shrine settlement, Hazard was in default.
The professional fire brigade returned and found the hut in full fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be removed virtually entirely and fire debris cleared to the absolute extent required.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery attached to the store at lunchtime.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, the charger was in the area of greatest fire intensity, according to the fire department.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined - as has the cause of the fire.
He is likely to be considerable, however, because the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Angry mother weds: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What just drove Lindsay Lohan to this extremely odd action?
She apparently wanted to take away the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has live-streamed herself as she appears to want to rip the children from a family in Moscow.
The US portal "TMZ" reports and publishes a partial intersection of the stream.
Here you can see "Fortunately Kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, Lohan can be seen getting out of a cart and going to a possibly homeless family she wants made up as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family virtually flees the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
It accuses the adults of child trafficking.
She provides no evidence for any of this in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan can be heard saying in the video as she continues to follow the family down the street.
She appears to be trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses an earful.
In tears, the actress then professes how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What caused Lohan to take this action is currently entirely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has 'Mascot' on the asteroid
The probe "Hayabusa2" launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is designed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck material in from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
There is talk of at least 420 deaths following the severe 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The number of victims could rise even further.
Rescue teams have not yet advanced into the devastated and areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk steps down as Tesla supervisor
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in stock markets in early August when he announced a retreat of the Eletro car maker.
The US stock market regulator sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk must pay, and the Tesla boss withdraws from the supervisory board, but CEO May remains.
Party conference of the British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the Tories' party conference
Birmingham is becoming the stage of a power struggle.
The conference is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit hardliners, on the front line former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over these name duplications for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and that's what the population is voting on this Sunday - whether it goes well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before Brazil's presidential election, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is emerging as the anti-system candidate, ahead in the polls.
His fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: 'Dieselgate' reappraisal takes longer than planned
"The diesel taskforce still exists," development executive Peter Mertens told industry journal Automotive Week.
The jailed and vacated Audi boss Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the taskforce would soon be disbanded.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/transmission combinations are expected to be examined," he had said at the time.
Mertens has now said: "In early July we reached an important stage in dealing with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The taskforce was set up in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the automaker has made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal never happens again.
On Friday, the VW supervisory board postponed a decision on Stadler's future and will discuss further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of allowing the sale of diesel cars with false emission levels after the emissions scams were announced.
In doing so, he knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, sales executive Bram Schot heads the company as caretaker CEO.
Because of the switch to the new WLTP exhaust and consumption test standard, there are production failures at Audi, said Schot of "Heilbronner Stimme."
In principle, he sees falling demand for sedans such as the A6, A7 and A8 audio models produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment in itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electric mobility.
There were already 15,000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to join DFB bureau
MAINZ (DPA) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office as DFB president again next year despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the 'zil affair.
"I do my job and strive to make it as good as it gets," Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio."
After all, you have to keep trying for re-election, I will.
And then you have to guess whether the support is there then as well.
The association chief, in his own words, would find it "odd" if he did not "desire to collaborate on the future project" after the 2024 football EM was added.
Grindel has been associate since April 2016 as the successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who was ousted over the summer fairytale affair.
In the fall of 2016, he was elected for a first complete term of three years.
The next vote is at the DFB Bundestag on September 27, 2019.
The future EM chief organiser Philipp Lahm is to co-operate in the DFB bureau, according to Grindel.
"I would love to see my colleagues in the bureau agree that he will continue to consult with the bureau in this role and then of course be welcome to provide his experience on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He would not participate in speculation about whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut 'zil and Ilkay Gündogan with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migration background should become the DFB's integration ambassador.
Currently, this office is held by native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If there is one with no immigrant background that clearly affects society and football and says "the issue is important, we need to take care of that," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs locally where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Getting it right with half-smart scales
I've owned a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that measures not only my weight but also the body fat percentage.
It can also display muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but that's more for the litters.
Surely he says nothing about whether I replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear impact for Berlin and Oldenburg
BERLIN - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the basketball league with an emphatic victory.
Against Science City Jena, the fourth seed easily won 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing tie for more than 40 minutes.
Newcomer Rokas Giedraitis was the dominant Berlin's top scorer with 20 points.
National player Johannes Thiemann (18 meters) committed from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators in his must-win debut.
Former Masters champion Brose Bamberg won the must-win debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best advertiser with the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg prop Gabriel Olaseni came in on 14 counts.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP giant Ludwigsburg topped the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt 83:76 (41:34).
New National's Karim Jallow was coach John Patrick's team's most accurate shooter with 24 points.
The ewe baskets Oldenburg began the new season with a significant success.
The basketball Lions Braunschweig had a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings topped the Oldenburgers with 25 meters.
The Brunswick, where NBA star Dennis Schroeder has been the majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run of baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdogan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdogan had earlier met Chancellor Angela Merkel and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdo'an called on the German government to extradite Gülen movement supporters living in Germany and crack down on Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
Cologne city centre had been partially closed for the opening of the Ditib mosque.
Several thousand police officers were deployed - among them snipers.
The Ditib Islamic Association has been criticized for being an extended arm of the Turkish government.
'Global Citizen Festival': Music against poverty: Stars, bugbears and horrors
Musicians including Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B campaigned for more commitment to fighting poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Engage you wherever you can," Mendes told about 60,0000 at the festival on Sunday night.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B stepped out in a red outfit with fringing and gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors including Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker and representatives from governments, the United Nations and aid agencies also showed up on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a scare as many onlookers thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was gunshots, got scared and tried to flee.
Briefly creating panic, people ran riot.
Seven spectators were slightly injured in the process, said the organiser Hugh Evans.
However, the New York Police Department and musician Chris Martin then reassured people from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anybody," Martin said.
You are all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were free on the Internet, as they are every year.
If you wanted to get one, you had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there were cheers and applause from the audience - booing, by contrast, for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
This one, while on stage with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, advocated greater equality for men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke out in the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge, alienating many women.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse to the point of attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which it rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women who said they themselves experienced sexual assault confronted him in an elevator en route to the committee meeting.
"You can also happily get together in an elevator with me at any time," Flake now said to the crowd at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: German government defends reproach of journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the reproach of a journalist from Chancellor Angela Merkel's press conference (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo'an.
At the chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had pulled over a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for journalists" and had gone to the front row.
The T-shirt, was not the problem, Seibert told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
It was about a disruption to the running of the press conference.
The journalist's action had created a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
He has therefore prompted that personal protectors bring the man out.
Seibert said political concerns were not allowed to be demonstrated at press conferences at the Federal Chancellery.
This applies entirely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged spying activities or supporting or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
Turkish leaders blame the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: only in early September was Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Me'ale Tolu and Deniz Yücel have caused a stir.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but trials against the two are still ongoing in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and gutted his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice already: yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
HAMBURG - The "Inas Night" talk show produced by NDR is known for humongous conversations at the counter of Hamburg harbor pub "Haddock Post."
Presenter Ina Müller encounters some beer, some wine or even more high-percentage drinks with her guest to lighten the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebs also drink courage for the obligatory vocal entries.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time around: the actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Men's Hearts," "Terror - Your Verdict" or "The Horniest Day."
The Munich man didn't get the trip to the High North good at all, though.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crushed on it, the eyes just two little slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exuberant Florian David Fitz.
Yet he is not ill, he only has a powerful hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not entirely serious - insights he has now gained: "Rule one: Go NIE to Inas night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sow.
And spritz.
And the round of egg liquor, which slices ina at half past three, also lets go.
The consumption of alcohol is truly written in the 43-year-old's face.
His fans immediately posted a few tips for combating the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - presumably most purposefully - headache tablets.
Others were simply amused by the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
It is not yet known how Ina Müller survived the nightly ordeal.
However, as she has been moderating TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems far more tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has struggled with vandalism and ingratitude
Getting into the 36-kilometre railway bike path in the Red Ridge country in Treysa is hard to find and waste.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Shards, cigarette dumps, rubbish and faeces, demolished bin bags and now dismantled signs - so has been presenting entry with Seat Group to the cycle path on Haaße Hill in Treysa.
A more than inglorious sight for the flagship railway bike path in Red Riding Hood country.
The issue has occupied members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for longer, according to the city's cycling officer Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been raised in the Cycling Council.
So far, there is no solution.
The proposals ranged from moving the seating group to regularly emptying the waste bins and cleaning the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Deserthagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) is reported to have also brought the issue to the local council.
It's not just the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular gathering place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only does it frequently go loud, with the vows also destroyed: posts ripped from the earth, bins demolished, signs redressed, seating smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more frequently, ADFC member Susanne Klippert tells me.
However, the actions are just the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They resent that the resting place at the bike path in Treysa is meeting place for swell.
"Along the entire cycle path there is clearly the focus here at Haaßen Hill," confirms the cycling officer, who is now also concerned about the new cycle site in Goat Grove, which opens today.
'Does she suffer the same fate, it's going to be really expensive.'
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly this sets the threshold much higher to reach common good.
However, that would require a police strike to come forward in a timely manner.
In principle, Desüstenhagen would like to see a development of Haaße Hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
After all, we can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
Tourist marketing is still outstanding.
Our bike path is very high quality compared to others in Germany," the ADFC members said.
As a highly critical danger site, ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in Ascheröder Strasse in Treysa.
There is no turning track to Haaße Hill.
With heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but probably for older people and especially for children.
Music contest at Culture Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creatively and in tandem.
"D to provide a song for Hiltrup," is the appeal of the Hiltrup City Council offensive, in the "Music Contest for Big and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians."
A contest "with eyesight in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family co-existence over coffee and cake from the cultural station volunteers.
Seven formations entered, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colors," three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the nursery of Lummerland and finally Rike.
This contest, declared district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city.
What were the texters connected to?
In the places, Hiltruper Lake and Market Avenue were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Hehmig singled out the avenue in his sleeper-like song to the "Koe of Hiltrup."
The cultural station was also recognised.
Time and again it was about experiencing coexistence in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the brief rebuilding breaks with brief interviews with the performers or hints about their creation.
So you learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
From sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew the recent one was performing in Ludwigshafen - at a big BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the programme.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has all but placed on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke had said.
In fact, all the participants got a gift from Hiltruper Gastronomy.
There was nonetheless something special for the jury favourites - so that others can hear their songs.
An entire CD can feature Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: him with his Hiltrup stroller, which particularly impressed Franke with its musicality, and the "Lummerland Rudel": "a very nice gig" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children performed again for the finale - and even sounded "properly good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was led by the aspects originality, relation to Hiltrup, catchiness of melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß of KvG High School and Oliver Ahlers of the business association and Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The City Section offensive created the event on the occasion of its 10th anniversary.
She dismissed the event as a full success.
Everyone is "very pleased," and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon-to-be very full cultural station.
The Word Game: 'Decrypto' in game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a viewing screen, in it four cards with keywords that you can't decipher - the old trick with the red foil - until you put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read anything by mistake.
The cards then, for example, read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2nd window.
3. dice.
4th Feast."
These are the terms to be encrypted from now on.
Because you're not supposed to guess the terms here, but codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that maybe says "3.4.2."
Guess in "Decrypto" should not be the terms behind the secret foil, but its encryption codes.
His task in this case: He is supposed to describe - in that order and in this example - the terms "cube," "feast" and "window" - and in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team fails if possible; because that wins the tie if he twice manages to crack the code.
So the encryption notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the Cubs, "Lots" as opposed to Feast; here, of course, something like "Party" would also be possible and "Prague" because he was paying attention at school and knows the window fall there.
So it goes round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the opposite side - but can string them together better with every hint the encryption gives there.
So the rewrites should be as mysterious as possible but not too turned away, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule booklet.
The fellow players probably have to study it quite long and at length until they can finally play.
The explanatory video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But those who have set off first will be intrigued by how much feeling is in this unseemly game.
Overall, though, "Decrypto" isn't quite as conclusive as predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames," which also stalls an agent theme on a game of fewer words but is much better for playing in small groups.
And anyone who is concerned only with rates and not with winning points can also easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests at pub
A 48-year-old man employed Kulmbach police double the same on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler salute in the Upper City of a passing police strike, then later he also fell in the Upper City in a pub as he harassed other guests.
After clearly alcoholic failing to comply with the issued placard by police, he had to spend the night at Kulmbach police detention cell.
In the sober state, he must then also face criminal charges for using marks of unconstitutional organizations.
Plant Pressig was home to the Schubloks
The railway operating plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers cracked on buffers, you heard it all over the press," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the site and the station.
No one was raving about that.
There were also the brakes squealing and the wagons crackling.
That was just pure railways.
Statements that are mind-boggling for Dinkel's home pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railways.
Here was the starting point of the steep-ramp mountain range to the north, which has its apex in Steinbach am Wald after rising by about 220 vertical feet.
To cope, train and drawer locos used to be needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway operating workshop with 21 locomotives, apprenticeship workshop, control and railway mastery.
"The centrepiece was the hub, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a conversion in 1899," Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and 47 years of professional rail.
Locos for the side routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben were also operated by the railway plant (BW) Pressig, which was contracted in 1968.
On July 15, 1950, the "People's Sheet" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 Steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
Electrification of the route in 1939 already minimised the need for train and drawer locomotives.
From 1977 they were only needed on freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weighs were still ranked per month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were canceled, and in 1991, the rest were canceled.
Heidrich: "It's unfortunate that you didn't envisage better use of the site, even in terms of freight traffic."
Still at Pentecost in 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Department celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 Years of Electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld."
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," Georg Dinkel recalls.
A little later the off.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig rig station was history.
"The rangers and inhibitors performed the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mishap would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station led Pressig-Rothenkirchen for reversing the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current images are available here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber having upbeat success at China Open
BEIJING (dpa) - Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the Beijing tennis tournament like Julia Görges before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against France's Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent in the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa of Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Su'rez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6-3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the number 13 Russian gave up.
The Schwäbin now gets to face Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the "Art and Pleasure" series, a special exhibition opened in Mittelehrenbach over the weekend.
With great relief, organisers and visitors registered the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windgame Performance" opened in the open area of the Dahlmann- Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the "Round of Walberla" tourist club as part of the "Art and Pleasure" series.
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now on view in Mittelehrenbach.
Householder Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the vernissage.
He himself has been here since the first hour.
As did Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
Somewhat surprisingly, though, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his task into proven, young hands with good future prospects.
Both have already been active in selecting artists in the past and helping shape flyers.
Again this year, there is a 70-cent special postage stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's "Betzn austanzen" poster, designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high level of support for the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler of Nuremberg could be won for the musical framing.
Walking through the generous garden, it quickly becomes clear to the visitor that the title "wind game performance" formally challenges and playfully ultimately expresses artistic imagination.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with coloured accents.
Already at the entrance to the property, visitors on the right side of the "happiness tree" await from artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It's a tree stump, colour-brightened, playfully fitted with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object looks fairy-tale versed and invites you to linger.
From Corner Valley comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers in three-dimensional letters to dedicate 15 years to the event.
It's many parts, in the wind in motion.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Corner Valley has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child."
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn displays his colorful imagination entity of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windplay Performance" to wander through the eclectic art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be viewed until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 albums: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - This was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians also made air of their displeasure at the time.
At least five of them.
They partway didn't want to resign themselves to the fact that there should be no more singing life in the borough after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia."
It has since become legend: at a bank in Tinnenbusch, they raised the MGV 68 Albans from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary has been celebrated big in the "House of Encounter."
"It will be full today," chairman Jürgen Holstiege guessed, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanian singers.
They had the foundation festivities back on their own for the anniversary.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break first.
The traditional festival was back in time for the 50th anniversary.
An elegant ball it became to make festive clothes had been asked beforehand.
Guests sat in rows of seats not as usual in the "House of Encounter," but cozy at tables.
In between, movement was called for: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled the regulars and asked on the dance floor.
Honour thing that the singers from the MGV made 68 Albanians sound the voice themselves.
Adapted from the occasion were happy songs.
Almost set: "Such a day, as gorgeous as today."
Adapted from the exquisite grape juice many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheim wine."
Alluding to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded what the Latin term for "hop" is.
Again Sovereign was the chorus line of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in Tinnenbusch at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said: "He has such an easy manner, it's a masterstroke he accomplishes."By the way, this time not only men presented themselves singerically.
The women's choir "High C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented fine-sounding poetry.
There was also a large raffle.
The proceeds will fund a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd Division Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The auctioneer marches.
Three games, three wins - USC Munster's reserve under the auspices of Axel Büring finds itself right in League Three.
No trace of shyness or frack breaks, The Independent does its thing.
And that's really good at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city rival BW Aasee.
"That was not crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied trainer.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat we can very well live with.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a retrospective birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game haunted.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they get the goal, a game like that can kick in," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, USC, with its routine powers, made it all clear and brought the full yield to the finish.
'We're all aware of who's on the other side in such a derby.
That doesn't break us the genick.
I saw really good volleyball in phases," Annacker didn't hail the 0:3 - and immediately went about business as usual.
Where the trip goes for The Independent seems impossible to predict after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," Axel Büring says.
Only in one does he feel vindicated: "The 3rd Division has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable to regional volleyball."In the fourth division, they don't want to turn their gaze down any more.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they must look up.
However, an initial assessment can only be made after ten, 11 matches.
On Saturday, it's first to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on October 14.

Glider crashes - aviation student fatal
The pilot died when a glider crashed in Essen, Germany.
The single-seater flier crashed on Sunday afternoon while landing in a parking lot not far from the Essen-Mülheim airport, a police official said Sunday in Essen.
The parking lot next to Highway 52, normally used for shuttle traffic to the fair, was largely empty, and other people were not injured in the crash.
Emergency crews continued to attend to flight students and eyewitnesses on the ground.
In the immediate vicinity was the venue of an Oktoberfest, and numerous guests were expected there in the evening.
The cause of the crash was unclear - the weather was good, there were light winds and sunshine.
Essen-Mülheim is a small airport used much by pilots with light private planes.
On her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heather Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Dreamship," Heather Keller became a star.
Now she talks openly about the fact that the series could have been complicit in her marriage off with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on "Dreamship" made Heather Keller (76) famous, but on Jan 01, 2018, she went off board forever.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), to whom she was married for 10 years.
'That might as well have been a reason.
Because I was growing up with this work, traveling around the world with a suitcase alone and many colleagues I admired took me at eye level," Keller recounted talking to the "Image on Sunday."
At first she was only ever "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "dream ship."
For now, the journalists only called at Heather Keller.
'Whether he liked it so much, I don't know.'
She thinks it is possible that her then husband might well have been envious, but "like many men, Han's conversations about problems and feelings shied away."
Keller always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only right one and he didn't want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
This means in good German: I messed up," as she goes on to explain.
She always felt that "not being good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman I never was in truth, even if I sometimes appeared cheeky and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After an already failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes yet again, "although I was afraid it might also go wrong a second time."
The day before the standoff wedding, I sat howling in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why it never worked out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love then "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not day-to-day.
I've been far too naive about love."
The Night Falter, which regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has ventured to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our falter is not a moth, but still a little light-shy.
And the gritty sheen into which a green carpet has dipped on Sechseläutenplatz dazzles him excessively.
But it's stop film festival, as more or less famous would like to sunbathe in the headlights.
So he torches across the square this late Thursday night to ease up briefly in the "Aquaclean WC Oasis."
This is what the public restroom, sponsored by a large plumbing company, is called, which premieres at the festival: the need facility in the parterre of a new pavilion puts a lot of effort into exuding a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, the gentlemen's oasis stinks to heaven for some reason.
So out here, over to the other side of the road: invited guests who have just entertained at the cinema next door to the opening film "Green Book" are celebrating the start of the festival with a party at the three-storey department store as they do every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as we know, the works on show come from all over the world.
What you don't have to come up with in an article about this festival to avoid falling into surreptitious advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The falter ties a ribbon around the feelers, which has given it a good fairy, and two bulging doormen actually wave it generously in.
Inside, the loaded crowd crowd, dancing to live music well after midnight or letting DJ pretend rhythms to which they scream at each other, and spilling down exquisite hemlines with cüpli.
At the delicatessen shop in Souterrain, oysters await swashbuckling mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly sliced open, a chocolate fountain bubbling.
And the hammer is: all the sales racks of fully exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The Falter studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please beware on the escalator."
If these are two separate instructions, he has dabbled in dress code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the housewares department upstairs, the fowl dumps an espresso-prepared cocktail called "Golden Eye," matching the festival award.
The prize for the best drink is not compulsory for this mix with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting said brand for years, is not here on the evening either.
Since Drew, though, passed between local celebrity, cash table and kitchen items, a face familiar to the Observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
Its main protagonist should not be far off.
And really: right away, Viggo Mortensen, with soon to be sixty almost acting like a choir boy, walks through the crowd.
It is not quashed, it is not obtained, it is at most stealthy.
Especially for this reluctance, fondly misunderstood as clumsiness, international stars love this film fest.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team's victory.
Argentina football legend Diego Maradona appears to have settled in well at his New Mexico home.
After a 2-0 win by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to cumbia rhythms with a player in the cabin, as seen in a video released earlier on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow-colored jersey, booed by the players.
The Mexican second seed had defeated the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: Composite 1: ASV sending after last-minute bust-up 'destroyed on the ground'
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association ASV Senden, could hardly face it: "Such a bitter defeat."His guards were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bust - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
They had - as in Steinhagen, as against Hill Horst - not played badly for wide periods, the senders.
Only the early stages "we totally wasted," angered the ASV coach.
Quick led the House leaders 8-1, even the early time off that Bieletzki had taken did not initially fruit.
"But then suddenly a jerk went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter.
At the break, the arrears were only two goals.
Above all, Senden's best, Marius Hintze, hit another time in the phase.
After the change, it got even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst equalised at 15:15, then the batting changer led almost throughout.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still a seemingly reassuring three hits (29:26).
And then?
The impartial intervened.
Bieletzki is usually wary of seeking blame from others.
But: the 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff took "was a joke."
Lit had a good laugh and hit four more times by the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, at the back also against seven men well and kept throwing on the empty goal.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come," the restless Bieletzki served.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), Van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (County Court), police are searching for the woman's remains.
Forces dug up a road at Marxgreen on Saturday.
To do so, the road surface and several layers below were worn down as police and prosecutors worked together.
According to new evidence, the missing may have been buried not far from where they lived at the time.
The woman has been gone since November 4, 1986.
Investigators at the time also did not rule out a crime.
For the past year, the Court of Criminal Investigation has been working intensively again on the case, along with the prosecutor's office.
Along with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Heritage Preservation Authority, the investigators encountered a striking under the road at Marx Green using a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, officials bounded the spot to a few feet.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking on the web.

Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his impending recall as head of the multi-billion dollar firm.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission settled a legal dispute out of court over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to lead listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk also relinquishes the post of chairman for three years, a position comparable to Germany's supervisory board.
He may remain the head of the board.
In the settlement, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager in Manhattan federal court for fraud.
Musk, who also chairs space firm Spacex, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is unaware of any blame
Musk left explaining that he did nothing wrong and was saddened and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers saying he might take the company off the stock market, paying $420 per share, funding secured.
That would have valued Tesla as a whole at $72 billion.
Later, Musk rowed back: Tesla remains on the stock market.
Under the agreement, Tesla must now find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members and also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team 1-1 at Chelsea FC
Liverpool FC still got to a 1-1 draw at Chelsea FC.
In the top game at Chelsea FC, the attacker just joined by coach Jürgen Klopp in the 89th minute for 1:1 (0:1).
After six wins to start, Liverpool dropped to second.
Chelsea remain third, and the new leader is Manchester City.
Eden Hazard provided the Chelsea lead in the 25th minutes with his sixth of the season.
After that, the Klopp team missed out on several occasions.
Nationals player Antonio Rüdiger cleared on the line (31) after a solo from Liverpool's Mohamed Salah.
Near the end Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a smash to the angle.
Record-breaking Manchester United are slipping ever deeper into crisis after the worst start to the season since 1989.
The team of controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United earned 1:3 (0:2) and remain only in the table midfield with ten points after seven days.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match against FC Valencia.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno arrived on his first Premier League assignment following an injury to Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League game at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won 2-0 against Brighton'Hove Albion through goals from Raheem Sterling (29) and Sergio Agüero (65).
Leroy Sané prepared 1-0, Ilkay Gündogan did not use the new leader.
'Let's Dance' juror Joachim Llambi and wife Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi has probably separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known by the RTL show "Let's Dance."
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Picture on Sunday" (Bezhalinhalt) reports on the separation of the well-known presenter and dance expert, citing Llambi's lawyer.
"Our clients have separated consensually and amicably," the jurist told Christian-Oliver Moser, according to "BamS."
Most important to the two now is the welfare of their two daughters.
The couple had met in a pizzeria in 2003 and married two years later, according to the report.
Joachim Llambi is from Duisburg and was a successful tournament dancer and stock broker.
Llambi became known on television for his law activities on the celebrity dance show "Let's Dance" on RTL, as well as various appearances on quizzes and entertainment shows.
Arrests at demonstration in Barcelona
BARCELONA - There were clashes with police on Saturday during demonstrations in Barcelona.

A total of six people were arrested.
Polls: 46 percent don't want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
After the crosshairs of recent weeks, the GroKo is taking several poll lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is critical.
BERLIN - The AfD overtook the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday trend for the Bild am Sonntag.
In the Opinion Research Institute's weekly poll, the AfD trails by one count to 17 percent, and the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week, finishing at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lose a count, coming in at only 27 percent.
That's the deepest value yet for the union in Sunday's trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If federal elections were held on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would together get only 43 percent of the vote, according to Emnid.
As a result, the grand coalition has currently lost the majority on Sunday's question at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The ruling parties consistently get to 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 federal election, together, they still received 53.4 percent.
Among the other parties, the range is also large: the AfD, second largest party in several polls, comes in at 15-18 percent.
The Greens reach vote shares of 12.5-17 per cent.
The left is averaging 10 percent, and FDP is at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the share of the vote.
But popular support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also dropped significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens find Merkel to be the right one in the chancellery, as the Emnid poll commissioned by BamS found.
Only one in two (50 per cent) currently want the grand coalition to hold until the next regular federal election in three years, according to the poll, with 41 per cent in favour of a new election.
A further poll published on Saturday had also seen significant drops in popularity for Merkel.
Divided Germans are also assessing whether Merkel should run again for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favor, with 44 percent opposed.
So among union supporters, 64 percent want a candidacy, 35 percent do not.
Hang out at Aldi: Price reduced to love-in
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - they should talk about turkey at Aldi Times.
MUNICH - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket almost radiates an anachronistic romance as a knowing place for big love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey, boxer short bargains at the wheeling table or the favourite pudding is still in doubt a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder is in the call to be less a contact but more a slippery stock exchange.
We have ventured the test: how do women react, you don't talk around the hot porridge for long in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
Regulatory Hollywood lovestory potential has it when the love-in is preceded by an out-of-eyes-lost-and-recovered plot.
If the guy then logs on to his or her worshippers under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch'gmx.de, that sounds a lot like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - romantic comedy at it's best.
So it's entirely to the originator of this annonce in a US-unknown Aldi branch that she will find her dream man, with whom she briefly chatted about the "30 per cent reduced organic turkey."
For believing in the magic of getting to know the analogue, she definitely earned her happy ending a la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the start of the new school year, Ludgerischule has been involved in the action "Lids Against Polio - 500 Caps for a Life Without Polio."
Polio is the shortcut for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The condition, referred to in German as polio, leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be contained by vaccination so far, as stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc call for calm for goalless
Leverkusen (DPA) - BVB sporting director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to public discussion about Mario Goold's form and fitness.
'We should stop worrying about Mario.
That doesn't do the boy any good.
And we don't do that well," the goalless Reus told TV channel Sky after the 4-2 win in Leverkusen.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (DPA) - Manager Max Eberl of the Borussia Mönchengladbach Football League sees no rush to a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We have not even talked about a treaty.
There's no fixed date for when we do that.
"However, there will most certainly be the moment where we sit down and talk," Eberl told Sky TV on Sunday night.
Football: County: Researchers' performance by VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine takes courage
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went in hard with the SES.
Word Carg gave himself, the football county coach VfL Wolbeck, only withdrew (inside) to sing about the lack of performance on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it's running round the fire hovepath again.
Baptist evidence is 1-1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, only thin on the rise last season.
Yes, I'm very happy with the performance.
'We've made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys, looking for each individual after the game to say simply "thank you" for so much opposition to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it was almost seamlessly over from the 4-4-2 into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes was in front waiting for balls.
Wolbeck had far more play in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his off (17), the standout Luca Rehberg (26) and Jan Schroer (38) missed the lead.
It almost would have been avenged when the SCA struck twice in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box in minute 41 - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proving to be master of his subject.
After the break, the VFL cheekily took full control.
Thewes from 18 yards narrowly failed.
Schroer was also late in a Thewes delivery after 58 minutes.
With the confluence of Miles Geske, Fetsch of the left again missed a freshman cure.
When Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer faked Robin Westhues in the 70th minute there was an indirect free kick for the Leafs 18 yards from the guest case.
The filly entered himself and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right stroller struck the bottom left out of view of the shooter - 1:0 (71).
20 minutes left, which should be damn long.
And then this: VFL captain Florian Quabeck floated the leather in the penalty area awkwardly in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the spot.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79).
Banged minutes had to survive Wolbeck in the closing stages before Geske had the winner on the pusher in the 87th minute from 12 yards.
Might have been too much of a good thing.
VFL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Silk), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt win 4-1 against Hanover 96
Starting point: Four points after five days - that couldn't be enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure the first home win.
Striker Ante Rebic, who was the starter for the first time after injury, should help.
Midfielder Luca Torruzzi was also back after a hamstring injury and should use his header strength to prevent the SGE from conceding further goals to standards.

Helicopter in Kottingbrunn crash
On landing, there was an accident at the still at the air field.
The four passengers were slightly injured.
There was drama around 2pm on Sunday at the airfield in Kottingbrunn.
There was turbulence when a helicopter landed, as police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was captured by a gust of wind, cracked on the ground and came to a halt sideways.
Immediately, the police, rescue and fire services were notified.
With a large-scale surge, the forces came to the accident.
A note of caution was also called to the 'AMTC emergency helicopter.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, it all turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one property damage.
The four occupants were only slightly injured and were able to go back home independently.
The exact circumstances surrounding the accident have not yet been established and are under investigation.
According to fire spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small origin fire, but it could be extinguished quickly.
AllBright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on company boards
As a result, a mere 8 percent of boards were female as of the September 1 deadline, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture," which will be officially presented this Monday by the AllBright Foundation and preceded the German Press Agency.
"Companies will have to set up differently, otherwise international competitors will move past them," said foundation CEO Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, Britain or Sweden, male-only leadership teams have long ceased to be conceivable.
The lag makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and forward-looking in comparison.
It's a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German exchange companies was also due solely to positive momentum among companies in the Index of Medium-Sized Values (MDax).
True, only 6.8 percent of boards are female, according to AllBright data.
In the previous year, however, the figure had been 3.8 per cent.
At the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I'm sure the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women again in the coming year - in their own interests," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signalled they would continue to make no commitment to increase the proportion from "zero percent" so far.
Another picture emerges among boards: As of September 1, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"Recruiting as many women annually for the boards would be a 40 percent share as early as 2023," the report says.
Some even make meadow: Luxury car bodies: which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Best deserved Ferrari.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: that slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the gem suppliers makes the most profit per car.
MUNICH - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers cash in per car they sell?
This question has been addressed by "Car Paper" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros of operating profit in the first half of the year with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, by contrast, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even laying strong on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well into the race with prices averaging 33,000-38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euros in earnings before interest and tax EBIT.

Torchlight to open 60th Abtswinder wine festival
Using a torchlight, the tourist club in Abtswind opened its wine festival session.
For the 60th time, the club is hosting the wine festivals, which continue to rise every Saturday in October in the large marquee on Rehweiler Street.
At the start of the anniversary, the leaders moved to the festival site under the sounds of the playwright's train from Wiesenbronn.
In the already prolific marquee, the chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and Wine Princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed guests. "To align 60 years of something like this - this is a mad feat for a small place with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later symbolically joined the guests from the stage.
"Nice that again so many found their way to us after Abbot Wind." Later, "The Troglauer" set the mood.
On Sunday, when the Abbot Winder church was also celebrated, the club had set drink prices as they were 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival will take place at the guest's house on Friday 5 October, before moving on to the second round a day later in the marquee.

The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue lights and Martinshorn.
He then joined the taxi on an intersection that drove at Green.
The doctor's car slammed against a traffic light mast and a tree after the collision.
He captured the passer-by still dying at the scene of the accident.
Driver of emergency vehicle and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency vehicle were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed by forces.
The emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another induced emergency doctor tried to do so - but to no avail.
The three most seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
Police, in close coordination with the Bonn prosecutor, are investigating who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho we make it uncomfortable
After blundering out in the ligacup, Manchester United now also lose in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, Manu is 1:3. The manner of the defeat is still likely to be talked about.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute in which the recovering Marko Arnautovic shot 3-1 for West Ham; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Since they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester's defenders were left standing, and Arnautovic lent all the time in the world to shove the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative highlight of a previously already largely inadequate performance.
The mood at United's city rivals Manchester City is very different at the moment.
The Nationals, trained by Mourinho's great competitor Pep Guardiola, came to an unbeaten 2-0 win against Brighton x Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the outsider's defence for the first time for the home team.
Sergio Agüero made sure of the sixth win in the seventh game after a good hour and a double pass with the former goalscorer, and with it the leap to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table-toppers
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the ligacup, xherdan Shaqiri fought out a 1-1 draw against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As with the cup-off, Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man at the London.
The 27-year-old's 25th-minute strike remained the only strike of the game until the closing stages.
Shaqiri, who came onto the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, still missed after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his smash.
So after the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea were impossible to beat for the second time.
First the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the cup, through the away league the Blues now topple Liverpool from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London City clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 wins.
The Gunners' fans, with Granit xhaka playing through, had to be patient for a success message against the Hertfordshire County surprise team until the 81st minute, however.
Nine minutes from time Watford defender Craig Cathcart bucked a delivery from Alex Iwobi's unlucky into his own goal, just two minutes later Mesut xzil made the decision with his third of the season.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to the fifth successive win and are newly immediately behind big rivals Tottenham in 5th, a strong impression continues to be left by rising Wolverhampton under its Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten at 2-0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth year in a row and occupy 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Paris car salon in sign of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
PARIS - Officially no issue and yet ubiquitous, the diesel scandal and the struggle over driving bans and retrofits is also unlikely to let go of German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 automotive salon, they will show off their novelties from next week, along with competition from around the world in the French capital.
The diesel doesn't really matter much anymore.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin by then, are still likely to be an important issue at least behind the shiny scenes of the exhibition stands.
One big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not the core VW brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electric models among others: the Ingolstadt's e-tron is due to launch at the end of the year, the 2019 Stuttgart EQC.
But both have already been officially presented.
BMW's iNext is not scheduled to launch until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3 Series.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from October 4 to 14.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle builders and numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in each of their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, is held every two years in alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, well over a million visitors came.
The severe earthquakes and subsequent tsunami killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was rocked by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the magnitude 5.9, the second the magnitude 7.4.
Communications and transport links are damaged, there was huge damage to property.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke in across the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that casualty figures are still significantly up.
The numbers so far are from Palu only.
But it also affects numerous other communities - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists at Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schroeder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and therefore responsible for the pastoral concerns of PS strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) is always held on the last Sunday of a month at the Haus Nordhelle.
The conclusion of the season is traditionally celebrated by bikers at the Peace Church in Eveking.
There were about 150 bikers gathered on Sunday to mark a far from ordinary service.
As early as 10am, the Bolids were lined up outside the church's entrance portal.
At first the biker spring was on the agenda and it was allowed to strengthen with coffee and cake or even already with a defective currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was delivered during the biker service Pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical underpinning.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill strikes more poetic-quiet tones," Pastor Frank Schroeder.
Again, this was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service yesterday.
Fugitive Home Club's big feast: After the cider comes the milk
And Borisch was also active in the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
There was also a great deal of interest from Georg Hartmann-Niemerg.
He had his cider press in his luggage and demonstrated to his amazed viewers step by step the process from mature cider to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and had them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Still, probably not many of the children could imagine how this would once become a tasty drink.
But they could also look at this important piece of work this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the a little like chopping good pieces of apple on top of each other.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the fugitive farmer also had already finished bottling specialties.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented the elderly visitors with the latest feather whites.
Demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly great.
In a cosy atmosphere, parents got talking while the children could not only follow the process of cider pressing but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Acts of the fugitive camaraderie of former soldiers also engaged as part of the feast, inviting curt play at some stations.
The Home Office will also offer a day of action next year.
Then, though, Gregor Krützkamp pointed out, not the home house in the heart of Thrift Village will be the site of events.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious due to the issue: eventually it will go round the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season bust: "Stricken situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth successive Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
There were not many positives before at 1:4 (0:2) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt, however.
"It's a coy situation, but you have to get out there as a team," 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler said, shifting after: "That's disappointing, of course, because you always take a lot."
The farther-sighted Lower Saxony, for whom only Florent Muslija (86th) met, are at the bottom with two counts and are a runoff candidate in their current constitution.
Led by the towering Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated the first season home win.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45-1), Jonathan de Guzm'n (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who advanced to the middle of the table with seven points after the successful rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Rome.
Croatia's vice world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action by Hesse in his starting debut and never got to grips with Hanover's defence.
The post-World Cup striker showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable to the one.
As well as Rebic, Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was the first time in the initial formation of Frankfurt that began swinging.
A header deflected onto the goal net by Lucas Torruzzi (17) brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defence around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term dropped Kevin Wimmer (back).
Leadership for the housekeeper almost inevitably fell and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a deflected corner, Haller extended by head in front of goal where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga match for the French second seed AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt levelled before the break.
This time Haller matched his Storm partner Rebic, who memorably tanked through and gave 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
At halftime, Hanover coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak notion of his elation, bringing in two new offensives in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxons were now playing a little bolder up front, but inflammatory ideas remained until near the end, when after all the connection was still possible.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic launched a solo and then laid across to De Guzm'n, who only had to push the ball into an empty goal.
The rest was just show-offs for Frankfurt against overwhelmed guests, even Jovic hit a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good mood at Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Munich mayor, Dieter Reiter, made it to an audience of millions at the opening of the 185.
Munich's Wies'n last week by two shots.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross feast
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14 or the Sunday after.
The festive service takes place at the city church, then is a procession to Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross church is home to the Shot Christ, which dates from the Thirty Years War and is believed to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood then flowed from the gunshot wound.
This developed into a major pilgrimage to the shelled Christ, which then also led to the construction of Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished to this day, merely the altar space stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his homily, Pastor Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly attended despite the importance to Geisinger Parish.
After the service, the procession to Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing, the church portion of the cross festival ended.
For many years, the Catholic Church choir has been inviting the Catholic parish home for the secular part of the festival.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and the weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish still offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger, on behalf of the parish, informed visitors of the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows, and the upcoming construction, which will continue into next year.
Since the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage has been more precisely ascertained and the individual tenders prepared.
What is certain is that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage already done a few years ago has increased, but more has been found, which was only made possible by the appearance of scaffolding.
The plaster plastering work has been completed, natural stone work is still to start before winter and it is hoped that well over half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New dormitory in New Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
Donau-Iller Life Support is opening a new residential home for people with disabilities in Muenster View Street.
That "a very special house" is now being handed over to its provision in Munster View Street - everyone present agreed on the inauguration date.
After all, the 12 wheelchair users who have lived in the Donau-Iller life support home for some time now rely on the special architecture of new construction.
Wider aisles, hallways and doors, larger rooms and accessible access for all areas architect Rudolf Bader has considered in his concept.
The first planning began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer's building was put to the test for residents with a cellphone cap: "The house was down the years and out of time in equipment," Bader explained retrospectively.
In 2016, the diggers returned to tear down the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life support Danube-Iller opens new residential home
About 4.6 million euros invested in life support in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the Schwaben district 450000 euros.
The construction work has remained within the planned framework - in time as well as financially, according to architect Bader.
He was also thanked by the managing director of Life Support, Jürgen Heinz.
The gap between accessible and fire-safe construction has not always been easy.
Still, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that let residents experience the freedom to move even without foreign help.
Similarly, the head of Swabia district's social administration, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house aligns with the special needs of its residents who need tools to be mobile."
In doing so, the housing and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further, "the plot in this location is a real gamble because it is so no longer available to acquire in today's situation."
In total, the new residential home in Muenster View Street offers almost 1500 square metres of space for 30 people with disabilities, divided between three groups of homes.
Pride is Life Support CEO Heinz on the 11 full-time workers, all employed by Fare.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
BERLIN - Ahead of Unity Day, SPD deputy leader Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to put up with disadvantage for East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after nearly 30 years of unity.
We must not settle for these differences," the prime minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told Tagesspiegel am Sonntag.
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions across the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked longer on average than people in West Germany, but 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this putrid dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is designed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
Like Moon's office on Sunday, the two dogs about a year old reached their recipient as early as Thursday.
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to "facilitate habitation" for the animals.
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendly was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
In doing so, both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and jointly bid to host the Olympics in 2032.
As part of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion.
Austria's moving history in mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
A host of new books have been published to mark the republic's centenary, celebrated this commemorative year for nearly ten months now, answering this question mostly in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it very differently in Austria's magnificent "picture book," which will be published October 1.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to non-fiction work - that is the unofficial motto for the grand coalition working week starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and even the CSU last did not mantra the "return to non-fiction."
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to question justifiably what the difference is between work and material work, but so be it.
If the federal government is now ready to rededicate itself to its mission - governing - it should not be stopped with term debates now.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually do anything together after the provocations and blunders of recent weeks may show as soon as Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the ruling parties come together for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflict early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First, though, conflicting issues are back on the agenda with the diesel retrofits and skilled immigration law.
CSU transport minister Scheuer wants the car companies to be glimpsed with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see manufacturers as obliged to technically retrofit older diesels.
While a rapprochement has emerged in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the union and SPD are still far apart on the proposed skilled immigration law.
The SPD is calling for a lead for rejected asylum seekers working or training.
The union is strongly opposed to the "track change" from the asylum system into the labour market.
So there will be controversy again among the coalition partners - and how should it be otherwise?
It is not equal and equal that GroKo has come together, but three partners with some very different social images and priorities.
Controversy is good.
Without controversy, a society drawn by such diverse, sometimes conflicting interests does not advance.
But to be constructive, disputes must not again be inflated for partisan reasons on the question of being or not being.
This is still about politics, not theatre.
The union and SPD are supposed to argue - but always have a look at people's reality of life.
What is feasible and beneficial to many?
With this leading question, both the diesel and lane change issue can be pragmatically resolved - and so regained trust.
That is what the Popular Parties must fight for now.
Mushroom checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister targeted
Does the employment minister, of all people, violate the current right of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Really day and night" her legists had been working on social security reform, an exuberant social affairs minister reported when presenting selfies two weeks ago.
In the case of list mushroom mandator Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPx) is met with astonishment - it brings the matter to parliament via question now.
She expects "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the use of her team and in no way to announce breaches of current service law in front of running cameras."
Nevertheless, she now has questions about being able to "free Har'tinger from any suspicion."
Police rip up a street in search for women's body
Marxgreen - Lange would not comment on the police.
Now there is confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The route is still closed in the Marx Green area until Monday.
It was preceded by the fact that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, along with its guide, was eventually able to narrow the relevant spot to a few metres.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian conservation authority in the area of the said road piece.
For more than a year, prosecutors and criminal police have been working court the missing persons case.
Time and again, a bike path has been closed at Marx Green and examined with sonar equipment because investigators suspect Heike's body may have been scarred here in the wake of the rebuilding of State Street 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of Catalonia's controversial independence referendum.
But ties are already occurring before then.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
BARCELONA - Clashes between separatists and police broke out in central Barcelona just before the anniversary of Catalonia's October 1, 2017 independence referendum.
Catalan security forces were attacked with paint powder by pro-independence supporters, among others, as they sought to prevent them from approaching a national police and civil guard demonstration.
Some 3000 officers from the Police Units of Policy and Guardia Civil wanted a rally to honour their colleagues who were deployed to polling stations last year in what was considered an illegal referendum.
There was also violence at the time in trying to prevent citizens from voting.
Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations by the separatists and central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the roughly 6000 separatists, however, then used force to try to break the police chain, and pelted officials with paint bags and eggs, among other things.
Six people were arrested, and 24 others were slightly injured, it said, citing the authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region from Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
Then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also set off abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, remain in suburbia.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, forced administration was ended.
But new regional president Quim Torra also insists Catalans' "right to self-determination."
Football: Upper Westphalia: Assembled guile: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate torrentially
Red-and-white Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
Even with FC Gütersloh, it was only a 0-0 draw.
The final and the third last, in front of 438 spectators at Heather Forest Stadium, dismissed them as assembled guile.
The first half was manageable by the entertainment factor Arg.
Those who therefore preferred to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so unconcerned.
There was no danger of missing a scoring chance, because there were virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Gütersloh's Nick Flock in the 28th minute was responsible for the first (harmless) goal of the entire game.
The Ahleners had the best - and in principle only real - possibility when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling into a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty box.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schroeder had to be replaced by injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel aimed just over the enclosure from 18 yards and after an hour the Gütersloher also appeared offensive for the first time.
After a ball-taking by Matthew Wieckowicz, it went fixed.
The expeditiously presented contestant about Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62) with a but lashed shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also levelled with a header from Wieckowicz (66) after a corner from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first bringing in Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70).
It effected - nothing.
The Ahleners did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It was not until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but even that brought nothing.
Angelo Daut made an effort to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero," but unfortunately the zero was also up front.
"We weren't as torrid this time as we were against Woodwickede and that although our opponent had no desire to play here," noted RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensive "pitched everything that little bit" against a team "that just wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel we could get an opposite," Daut.
However, to his sorrow, as a spectator, you didn't feel like his team could score a goal either.
The notion was too tenuous for that.
Reckenfelder Harvest Market: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
This pleased Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder table issuing site for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening, the sky showed bright blue, while the place was still somewhat empty, but that was still to change during the day.
Because "here it is so beautifully sociable, that's why we are here today," said one visitor.
Organiser of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus greeted guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent pinch of humour.
For the couple Brockmann, who were supposed to be weighed up against food, in the short term Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" failed to musically entertain the ever-increasing visitors in between.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung along at the late hour.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer joked.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to put the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is delighted with the many acts with their stands, including mostly clubs.
"In fact, there should be no such thing as a blackboard," he nonetheless thanked the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of everyone deployed to the stands and also included the other festivities and "clean up" action held in September.
Our garden city gives itself a colourful paint - here goes what.
Then the Maikranz was taken down by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarter.
Work has been done on many stalls for the sake of it.
Everything from sweet to hearty was to be had.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, got creative on his decupling saw.
Veneer work, beer lids with Reckenfeld motifs and some more he had on offer.
One specialty offered three Reckenfeld beekeepers: "Reckenfelder Honig," brought in by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter still has a specialty.
Honey cake in the glass, of course, with honey from my own production.
Since little Elsa had to keep accessing, the cake tasted so good.
The conviviality is what then let visitors linger long into the evening hours, even without a stage programme that doesn't exist at the autumn festival.
Lubricants with local political message: No successful advertising for skate plant
In Lengerich, unknown people were campaigning in an hardly conducive way to build a skate plant.
There are appropriate smears in several places, says Jürgen Kohne of the city authorities at WN's request.
In at least one case, the police have been charged with criminal damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" prance on signs including at Gempt Hall and Old City Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that an appropriate font has already been discovered on the advertising sign at the stairs to Gempt Bistro after the professional election fair on September 19.
Since the brief message at the time appeared to have been left "only" with an edding, it was easily removed.
"A few days later, however, this was back, this time sprayed on," says Rottmann.
He expects the appropriate advertising sign will have to be replaced.
This particular case gets a special note from the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the panel.
If the skate system is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
Pledges are already in place, explains Jörg Hesselmann of the city's Department of School, Sport and Culture, without naming names.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies on the smeared panel.
For years, local politics and administration have dealt with the issue of skate plant.
After the old one was dismantled at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
The council eventually voted by a majority in favour of the firefighting car park.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against construction at this point.
A U-turn followed in late June.
Main and Finance Committee members now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
As for the state of affairs, Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is now in the midst of concrete planning.
The last word then is the city council.
He expects a decision this year, so if a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Air traffic control bottleneck gets worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no sign of improvement next year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm comes," the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit in Hamburg on October 5.
One important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known staffing of European air traffic controls, for which there is no quick fix.
"The airlines and the airports can make rapid improvements for next year, but training new pilots takes four to five years," the trade unionist said.
Across Europe, the market for ready-trained pilots is leaking.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized various aviation unions for not being invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city on Friday, representatives from the federal, state, air traffic control, airlines and airports are coming together to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about extra work compression and overtime, it won't be without us," explained the head of GDF, which has many members at the federally owned German Air Traffic Control.
Maas again blamed EU Commission guidelines for the piloting plight.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting costs and staff savings in national air traffic control systems are now fully reflected in operations.
Maas appealed to German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to lobby Brussels for regulations that "do not slash the air even further."
Currently, EU requirements would be voted on by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is under constant lobbying pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes the high delay costs started a rethink at the airlines.
The GDF will only cooperate in improving the situation if German air traffic control (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," Maas said.
The inclusion of 120 piloting students annually over the coming five years, announced so far, is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary build-up of staff is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp supervisory board votes for group revamp
Members of Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board have voted unanimously in favour of plans to rebuild the group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed chairman of the board at Sunday's meeting, the crumbling group is to be split into two self-employed companies.
Both companies are said to be based in Essen and listed on the stock market.
There should be no additional reduction in staff beyond the cuts in administration already known.
After two resignations, the control board counts only eight heads on the capital side.
This is contrasted with ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be made by an AGM in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is expected to include the 50 percent stake from the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business will be bundled with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: violence at demos of police and Catalan independence supporters.
There have been violent confrontations with numerous injured in two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona.
According to the city authorities, about 3,000 police officers from across Spain gathered on Saturday when about 6000 independence supporters also demonstrated.
Catalan police have tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a large-scale bid.
According to the forces, however, independence supporters repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and throw-ins.
There were also rancor between participants of the various protest moves, according to the figures.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
The police said that there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The policemen had wanted to pay tribute to colleagues with their demonstration, which came almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia banned by Spain's central government.
At the same time, they were demanding better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than them.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police officers were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez asked AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they throttled us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to provide his name with Daniel, rejected the allegation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who only did their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is for enforcing our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because this is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal details of UK ministers
A security breach at a mobile phone app has led to the personal details of ministers and MPs from Britain's Conservative Tory Party being temporarily accessible to anyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the panel was announced a day before the Tory party conference in Birmingham.

Football: Juve coach praised after top score: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record-breaking 3-1 (1:1) win over SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively bought star was the key man in the important game against the pursuer even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goalscorers, Juve turned the game around after falling behind early on through Dries Mertens's strike (10th minute) and hanging off the angriest pursuer for now.
The goalkeeper picked by Real Madrid initially put former Bundesliga prop Mario Mandzukic in charge with a double pack (26/49).
And Ronaldo, after a corner by header, also did the groundwork to strike defender Leonardo Bonucci (76), who had only to push in just outside the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," the trainer vowed.
But Allegri, of course, also wants to see goals from the attacker who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and Portuguese national team.
"We have to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve goalscorer is currently Mandzukic with four matches - Ronaldo has three on account.
With Ronaldo shopping for more than 100 million euros, the overpowering of Juventus seems to be getting even more crushing.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the back seven years already has six counts ahead of Naples.
The tally, trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not chanted against Turin.
But the top score was decided at the latest after the burst of already warped Mario Rui (58th).
The Portuguese had to be yellow-red from the spot after going in too hard against Paulo Dybala.
"We played well against a good Naples," the Turin coach commented.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel that way.
The German national has prevailed at Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool FC, was used in all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League tie against Valencia, which Allegri said meant the "half hour": Ronaldo was booed off the pitch in the Turin's 2-0 win and is locked for Tuesday's home game against young boy Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly scurrilous appearance, rapper Kanye West commanded attention on the weekend's US TV show "Saturday Night Live."
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused stir and question marks among viewers.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change in time for the release of his new album.
Henceforth, you may just call him "Ye," the musician.
"The creature formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted, paraphrasing the late singer Prince as he dismissed his artist name.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
Already the tenth album was released under that name.
In an interview with radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning to him.
"I believe "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you," according to the rapper.
Football: Circle League A1 Munster: Finally!
Managed!
Hoetmar's coach, Averhage, made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was just more gripping, we almost never posed him any problems." correspondingly thin reads the list of Hoetmarer disposals.
Grade times two scoring chances in 90 minutes, so rarely can games be made positive.
Football League A1: SC Hoetmar subject to SG Sendenhorst 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first round, but the first used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to take the early lead (7).
In the 43rd minute Steffen could have elevated Uphus, but after great groundwork from Krause he edged free standing.
The hosts merely had a double opportunity as first Moritz Höne failed to score Jos Shoemaker and in the aftermath Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster keeper.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all forgave.
Niklas Eilmann also could not use a handler - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the goal line with his hand and saw red for it - for the guests (75).
Only when Nils Berheide stabbed the ball over the line was the game decided (81).
"We had been harshly criticized before, which was then different today than in recent weeks," Florian Kraus concluded.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Body), Turl.
Goals: 0-1 Krause (7th), 0-2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75/Hoetmar).
Football: Circle League A2 Munster: Spectacle Football in Albanians: GW Albersloh subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't even know what to think of it," he rang for words.
"We didn't even get access to those," by which he presumably meant the wing braid with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably all the other green-and-whites who were striking with collective offensive drive.
He could still laugh: "A dreary victory," he still said, twinkling cheekily and pulling off then his players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had pulled themselves out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel of two teams, one of which, Albans, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting to stop.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes that were behind him.
"That was by far our best seasonal performance," he says.
"How we come back after 0:2, how we keep up against it throughout the game against one of the league's top teams, that was really phenomenal.""
This makes it all the more bitter that we now have to go home empty-handed.
Top goalscorer Lars Zymner brought the hosts level with his 12th of the season (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in that game for that goal.
The 2-0 he put over the left side mustered for Fabian Fröhning (39).
We knew that, but you can't take out a player like that completely.
"That was madness what the did," Lewandowski acknowledged of the quality of the opponent's envy.
Just before the change of sides, his own penalty made up for it: McGill's free-kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into Long Toreck (45).
After the change of sides, it was McGill again who scored the equaliser (59).
After that, it was back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nasty shocked Albans again (64th), just five minutes later, Patrick Horstmann equalised (69th).
Despite being outnumbered, Albersloh failed to counter the last Concordia hit (80) again.
We must now turn our full focus to Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we now have to win," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Straw Bücker, Adolph, Zur Mills - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74th / Albanian).
Football: TSV Strasbourg win point against Primus
There has been no winner in the National League duel between TSV Strasbourg and FV Biberach.
The table-toppers were actually encouraged for three points, however coach Oliver Pfaff's team stood up very well and in the end the game ended 0-0.
Media: Entire bureau of Dynamo Dresden resigned
The entire bureau of football second division Dynamo Dresden has resigned, according to media reports.
Several media outlets convened in the evening in agreement on a joint letter from the Board of Saxons.
No confirmation from the club was available.
The reason for the withdrawal is to be internal power struggles at the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
Good thing he's gone again.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Turkey's president was in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many had thought he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical academy tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offerings
The evangelical academy Tutzing is offering about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signalled he wants to pick up the tolerance prize in person in tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, tenure was too short: as federal president, he was not in Tutzing's evangelical academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
So academy director Udo Hahn billed him as saying proudly: "All the federal presidents and chancellor were already with us," that celebrities keep showing up at the academy at Tutzing Castle, but was also an issue when presenting the annual programme.
In late October, songmaker Konstantin Wake attends a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, and on September 29, the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile France's President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged: he wants to accept the Academy's "Tolerance Award" awarded to him in person in Tutzing, which also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The roughly 80 meetings through mid-2019 have it in them.
"The pension is just not safe!" is a conference title.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - that's how the academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting on Syria: "barbarism without limit."
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war mocks any humane idea."
From structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change in work through digitisation, the spectrum ranges.
Academy director Hahn was convinced that "a free democracy needs places where a civic society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting on the 200th
Karl Marx's birthday is about to await some more visitors to the direction of capitalism criticism, the others more of a tendency "from left to centre."
What about neutrality?
"We are, after all, 100 percent a daughter of the evangelical national church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for adults as well as men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday night at Christ Church Hall in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret destination, Teubner cracked gender understanding, not only with humor and heartwarming for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else may exist, but also with music.
The mini guitar set her up and also mastered her violin.
On the wing sat Ben Süverkrüp.
The one is the male sparring partner, who sometimes gets to speak even to the end of the sentence, and the other is a true pianist: so congenially harmoniously accompanying Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wanted a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, namely as it fit the red thread of the evening.
That's where Teubner had brought a paradox to play: the satisfaction of the man when he has a partner, but it doesn't open the door.
By contrast, a closed door without a partner brings no benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates selfies: What would have come of composing Mozart had "The Nannerl" unexpectedly opened the door?
So Southern glides over into improvisations, from Bach's "O Main Full of Blood and Wounds" into the "Song of Death," and from Mozart G minor Symphony into a playful tangle.
There was big applause and "bravo" from the full chamber.
Flowers was presented by Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the Chansonette.
But chairman Heidemarie Brandbeck did not take extra thanks.
She had the idea to treat the duo to one in Wolbeck alongside performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk may remain head of the board at electric car maker Tesla but must chair the board.
Musk also agreed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to pay a double-digit million penalty, as the SEC said.
The background is Musk's surprise announcement in August that he would take Tesla off the stock market.
The SEC accused Musk in its lawsuit of making false and misleading claims in the process.
Breaking Valley.
Police have slightly revised down casualty figures following a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg.
There were 10 passengers slightly injured instead of 15.
All have now been released from hospital.
The French bus driver had remained in hospital for a night for observation.
He will be released during the day, a police spokesman said.
The cause of the long-distance bus accident at Bruchsal is still unclear.
The long-distance bus crashed unchecked head-on against a control panel on Saturday morning.
Handball: Ladies' National League: Ahlener SG narrowly retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahleners had problems especially with third-year player Carolin Stallmann, who marked 10 hits alone.
'Actually I was well pleased with the defence, only one player made too many goals.
We didn't get to grips with those," ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
However, the anger was more about the many opportunities left out.
The concentration in finishing caused his team to miss out this time.
The ASG therefore fell behind almost until the end, trailing 11:12 at the break and later 15.18 (45).
Only towards the end did the wider bench of hostesses make a decisive impact.
In addition, Aydogdu backroom put Merle Klement on the left, which then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd Division Women: Top performance of BSV Ostbevern in top match at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, BSV Ostbevern's volley players have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd Division West.
At second-tier VC Allbau Essen, the blue-and-whites won 3-1.
'That's been a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked that out," coach Dominik Münch joked after an almost impeccable performance by his team at the toppled table.
The first round was dominated by guests almost at will.
OVER 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 went to last year's four-time champion with 25:15.
Food has adopted in the two-bar, but has not come into play.
We employed them well.
Our opponent has struck up with high risk, but also produced a number of tickets.
In the second set, BSV already led by 12:8. "Food has changed the assumption to triple bars.
We couldn't keep the impact pressure.
Food has been rangesuited, and we've been a bit lulled," Münch continued.
At 18:17, the volleyball players from the Ruhr region had their noses for the first time.
Although Ostbevern still fielded four set-pieces at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its target.
"The game was now a class better," was the tutor to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly with their surcharges to BSV turning the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly there."
Over 7:3 and 15:13, the blue-and-white passed four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted Most Valuable Player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV Women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening seen as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the manner of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's inauguration of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne.
"The mosque opening in Cologne has left a shambles in German-Turkish relations that can only be painstakingly swept together," the chairman of TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, told Germany's editorial network.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance for a joint, conciliatory performance.
"Instead of siding with German leaders to underscore Muslims' affiliation with Germany, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The wide-ranging exclusion of the German public has "emboldened many reservations."
Nottuln's Home Office: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break, Folktreff time is finally back.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7.30pm, the Nottuln Home Office is already hosting its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of Old Amtmannei.
Almost to the day, then, it's been a year since we first did a folk reunion.
Meanwhile, this event has become an integral part of the Nottuln musical events calendar," Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Hometown Association.
I would not have thought that our folktre was blossoming so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether storm Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the office mania's fireplace room was always busy.
"The programme at the next Folktreff is, as always, a motley mix of German folk, walking and seafaring songs, folk songs, evergreens and old strokes," Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites friendly musicians to Nottuln.
For the first Folktreff "birthday," Klaus has promised Spellmeyer with his accordion.
He was a member for many years of "Gaitling," a group from the neighborhood district of Steinfurt that played music with platform German lyrics.
Now he's travelling with an Irish folk band.
Folktreff's makers fondly recall the last event in the summer when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten delighted listeners with his international version of the song "Frogs at Night," sending home with an earworm.
"We count on many cheerful guests to once again spend a convivial and humorous evening," the home's invitation reads.
Anyone who plays an instrument and is keen to get actively involved is invited to join.
Since the coveted seats are always quickly occupied, it is recommended to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30pm, but admission is as early as 7pm.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons all outstanding issues must be resolved by October 24.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on the road to becoming the world's largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde announced Sunday.
That leaves approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the United States for the multibillion-dollar merger.
Most recently, the chances of approval there had improved, according to an insider, because Linde has pledged to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by October 24 for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit farming to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the District's Association for Horticulture and National Care was celebrated with a gala at Dr. Stammberger Hall.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Club House, the final founding impulses were set for the Kulmbach County Horticultural and National Care Association, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary at Kulmbacher City Hall on Saturday night.
To be sure, he was still called different then: as the "Kulmbach Town and Country District Fruit Club," he was baptized by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit growing association also differed from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit growing, about flowers and gardening at the time no one was thinking.
"At that time, in the epoch of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," county heiress Günter Dippold explained in his festive lecture.
Fruit trees should line long-distance roads, with schools created so-called industrial gardens.
Fruit growing is still the job of the 55 horticultural clubs in Kulmbach county today, comprising nearly 7000 members.
But this is far from exhausting the spectrum.
Nature-based horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play as big a role as communicating knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Mules" were entertaining on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed especially in the digital age," said county chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
Chestnut collecting has been a huge thing for us kids, I doubt you can gather much the same amount of joy with Smartphone x Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees along with fellow councillor Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand is decided by the county association," added Mr Söllner, highlighting the special importance of gardening clubs to villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green space in the village.
That this is a real concern of the many gardening clubs in the county also left county executive and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun in no doubt.
He led the many visitors with a picture lecture through the county association's long history, reporting, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
Everything used to come from the garden, for the winter it was ingested.
In the late 1950s, however, the utility garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has endured, it was already there before us and we have to be guided by it," pleaded the specialist for fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is the incentive for gardening clubs not to let up so that our home remains beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added the president of the Bavarian national association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif of the successful festivities solemnly framed by the tower blowers of the Thurnau Music Society.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada's foreign minister relocates UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: They provide both trading partners with an ultimatum for agreement.
Canada's foreign minister now gives absolute priority to the trade deal - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Because of time pressures in the struggle to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will not address the United Nations General Assembly until Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen announced.
In the meantime, she is focusing on renegotiating Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said Friday that Canadian and U.S. negotiators have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wants to join the trade deal already struck between his country and the United States.
The United States and Mexico agreed in August to rewrite the regional Nafta Free Trade Agreement.
US President Donald Trump hinted that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks on revamping have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be finalised, Trump's administration intends to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel L'pez Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the O Globo daily.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the final week before presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician was attacked on the open road in early September during a campaign event in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Entitled "Ele n'o" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
The associations against Bolsonaro's racist and womanizing statements also made mobile on the social networks.
Several thousand protesters were expected in the economic metropolis of Sao Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, protests mixed with a rally by Brazilian Workers' Party (PT) presidential candidate Fernando Haddad.
He replaced ex-president In'cio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and therefore may not run.
Brazil's presidential election is on October 7.
As the ex-mayor of the millionaire city of Sao Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has long been involved in political operation, but recently presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach an absolute majority in the first round, there will be a runoff on October 28.
Observers expect Bolsonaro will not emerge from this one successfully - no matter who he is up against.
Bolsonaro is known for clamping down on homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He is always shocked with verbal derailments.
Another time, he said supporters of Lula's leftist Workers' Party should be shot.

After a long illness, Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died Sunday at age 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen told Larsen's website.
At the deathbed, Larsen had been surrounded by his wife and his six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen was known for the band Gasolin', which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and The Beatles.
After the band disbanded in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt Om Natten" is the best-selling album in Denmark to date.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts."
The leader also recalled that the anti-monarchy Larsen had performed at the 70th birthday of Denmark's Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rock night at the shoe factory: Volume at press air chambers level
"Here We Stand, Take the Bone Saw and Light a Concert Night With the Power of a Tiger."The band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a rewrite of the Rocky Live music experience on Saturday night in the hall of the Civic Center Shoe Factory: Hard Rock from three bands with one another.
After the sound check and just before the concert begins, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booing agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - visibly inspire the 120 or so visitors to "Mint Mosquito" rock night with their bands.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika also knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with latest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the forthcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the performance is danced to the band's coherent and principled interaction.
Although "Encore" calls cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Booth."
That hard rock is not equal to hard rock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, at times reminiscent of classic 1970s rock.
After the "high energy rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is used in addition to guitar rock.
Not only does the yearning, downright ballad "Take Me Home" feature the switch from melodic passages to the guitar-lashed rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnischäuschen, however, has gained a special reputation since its founding in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
That "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances before very large audiences - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about touring in China of 2017 - is obvious and unheard of.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also uses his own accents in concert with the band on the evening's only covered song, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
Meanwhile, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a rejuvenated solo, running through the audience.
A certain volume is, of course, part of it, due to the genre: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixed-use team, the three-piece concert of "Here We Booth," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is at press-air chambers level, for example, but is still well below the "Wacken-Fesitval" controls that "The Ignition" points to on its website.
Ear-piercing 120 decibels in jet drive volume as usual at the annual metal pitch in the north of the republic, however, the Ahlener audience doesn't need this rock night.
After nearly four hours, the three bands of harder, rockier gear have long convinced with their soulful, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, having taken the bone saw and lit a concert night with the power of a tiger," all three groups, though in a figurative sense, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in glider accident at Essen/Mülheim airport
There has been a fatal accident at Mülheim/Essen airport.
On Sunday, a glider crashed in a car park at Mülheim/Essen airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
There was a fatal accident near Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
As the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung reports, a glider crashed in the fair parking lot at the airport.
The pilot had died.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, the flight student was on board alone - the flier is said to be a one-seater.
The plane was already in landing gear at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just a short distance from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen airport is located on the city limits of the two Ruhr region towns and directly on the approach to motorway 52.
From the car park there is a park-ride offer at big events at Messe Essen or Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump heaves Kim: 'And then we fell in love'
That the US president is well disposed to North Korea's leader Kim despite the nuclear crisis is no secret.
Now, however, Trump has made a real love-in to his colleague.
The also has to do with Kim's "gorgeous letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has become a new flame.
The tragic: it's a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
Addressing supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old sprout of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although that proves quite tough brogues in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was cracking, him too, and between us it was back and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Alright?
No, really.
And it was not just the talks with Kim that would have caused his heart to melt.
He wrote me gorgeous letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump pointed to Kim's announced halt to all nuclear and missile tests, even as critics behind them have so far seen little more than lip service.
The US president seemed well aware that affection for the whether his martial menace infamous "rocket man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - was not likely to be heinous to everyone.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of it right away during his appearance at a major sports hall of the city wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But he cares very little, Trump explained, and then aimed his index finger at the crowd: "I always told you it's so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this bounce-filled arena, but we would only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler's best attended, atmospheric as well as spoiled by sun saturated: very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city centre petered out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest was not just held in the marquee at the fire tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed to their disastrous prison conditions in Libya using a mobile phone video, allowing their rescue.
The group shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July at risk of life and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," one man said in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually flown out to Nigeria in late August.
"We probably could not have returned to Nigeria without the video," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
By his own account, the video put him in limbo.
One of his co-workers was nearly beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, prison conditions have been disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their homeland this year using the program, said the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians now rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor prison conditions in Libya.
But he has not heard of an appeal for help via cellphone video.
International organizations have long criticized conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as degrading.
The North African state, dominated to much extent by militias, is the main transit country for migrants en route from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher walked into the popular school place on Sunday afternoon to prepare her classes for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the front house of the 1st floor, she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a climb to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher agreed with the police, who have started the investigation.
Whether things or money were stolen cannot yet be said.
Offender description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the Obernberg Police Office at the Inn, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has endured several days and nights in his car in a woodland area in central France after he stuck the car off all forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue workers discovered the car by accident Saturday afternoon not far from a pasture and freed the one missing since Tuesday night, police said Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He admitted to now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner was reported missing by his family after failing to return from a trip with his off-road vehicle across the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intense search efforts, the man's whereabouts had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has urged the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The two countries' relations are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said Saturday after meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This mainly concerns waves of arrests, the press and religious freedom.
He therefore "made clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic ties are to deepen, that rule of law is a very important requirement."
Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He has formulated the expectation that freedom of expression will be respected.
Erdogan then re-emphasized the independence of Turkey's judiciary.
The Laschet and Erdogan conversation had been moved at short notice to a German Defense Ministry flight readiness building at Cologne airport.
It had originally been due to take place at Castle Wahn - but the castle owners had opposed Erdogan out of political conviction.
Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne after the conversation.
Laschet cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said "the Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their interlocutors - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of trust in U.S.: North Korea issues call for disarmament
While US President Trump never tires of emphasizing success in North Korea denuclearization negotiations, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for Washington to be accommodated.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government at the UN general debate of using its continuing sanctions to block negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
"The latest standoff comes as the U.S. is building on coercive measures that are deadly to confidence building," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way that we are the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat led.
That punitive measures could force North Korea on the "knees" is "a pipe dream of people who don't know us."
To build trust, however, his country halted its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri pointed out.
However, there was no "appropriate response" from the US side, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the U.N. Security Council adopted sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
US President Donald Trump and his secretary of state Mike Pompeo in recent days at the United Nations urged strict compliance with the punitive measures.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit meeting with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang again for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The HoT Serves: New cuisine with donations from the congregation
That they were actually in a youth retreat, the many visitors to the House of Open Doors HoT got nothing out of it: white blankets and floral tributes on the tables and a large buffet awaited guests after the harvest service.
The HoT's youngsters had conjured the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was funded by donations from the community, for which young people wanted to thank the food.
Starting with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had already filled our fridges with food and ingredients before the summer break and were perfectly prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: a power outage had put the huge, two-piece fridge out of action, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: we did get a great deal of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," says Westbuer.
And so everyone packed in.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"Chefs can't do better either," vowed one visitor impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on," Pastor Frank Beckmann pointed out, while magician Stephan Lammen caused astonishment with card tricks and other pieces of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state board NRW of the panel
Out of frustration with criticism from within his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has surrendered his post in the national federation.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a recording freeze for foreigners.
He resigned as vice chief of NRW panels back in July, Sartor told Welt am Sonntag.
Too many have fallen into my back.
The head of the tables national association NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed sympathy to the DPA for his longtime deputy's decision.
The sharp criticism has taken away from Sartor.
'I can understand his move - there have been people speaking out who didn't know exactly why the Essener Tafel does it.'
But Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes," according to Weilerswist.
Sartor, in turn, criticized colleagues from other panels in the "World on Sunday."
You should not take the approach, "Without us, the people of the city are starving."
It is up to the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not attend a congress of panels on Friday in Berlin.
"I am told too much sweet schmus," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis who were so critical of me at the time.
SF Lorch downplay 2-0 lead - Gmünder Daily Mail
Football, County Lorch loses to newcomers 2:3 - TV hypocrites win in Kirchheim after back-to-back - Bettringen clearly beats Lauchheim.
At 2-0, Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against TV Neuler - at the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment among sports fans was great.
Very different from the TV hypocrites: in Kirchheim the TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1, but won with 2:1 after 90 minutes.
Gladbach play down two-time lead - Schalke without Embolo with first win
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2-2, the Colts twice squandered a lead.
Schalke come up against Mainz for the first win of the season (1-0).
(SDA) Four times in the first five league games Schalke have manoeuvred themselves into the sidelines with early opposition.
Now Domenico Tedesco's team again displayed the strength with which it finished first behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf brought the home quipe into the lead in the eleventh minute after strong groundwork from Yevgeny Konoplyanka's head, as a result the hosts conserved the mini pad with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greet new from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had trailed 0-2 against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but still got the 4-2 win in the 2nd half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalized with a doublette inside four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was introduced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided the crowning achievement boost after the break with another doublette in the final period (86th/94th).
VfB Stuttgart also got the first win.
The Stuttgart forward was forced to banish two-times against Werder Bremen for a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic before the break.
Borna Sosa and inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious throw-in own goal that helped the guests equalize in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led VfB to the first win.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a fully successful but also failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang twice gave Gladbach a lead out of hand, ultimately playing 2:2 and still waiting for an away win at VW City since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's equaliser at 1-1, Renato Steffen was in charge with his second Bundesligator.
When flat-footed from 20 yards of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, as was the second counter after an hour.
Still, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promiscuous.
Alassane Pléa is proving to be a goalgetter in the Foals" storm.
Against Wolfsburg, French hit record buying by the OGC Nice for the third year in a row and seventh time in the seventh.
After seven rounds, Gladbach occupies 4th place.
Within 40 minutes the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen manoeuvred themselves into an uncomfortable position against VfB Stuttgart.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt's team lent surprise to a Stuttgart contender that the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis closed with his first of the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to set up his team: the 23-year-old Serbian cashed in after a tryline against Daniel Didavi's yellow-red.
Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Brewers back into the game through a curious throw-in own goal (68), a quarter of an hour before Gonzalo Castro shoved the Stuttgart back down the victory road.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Dusseldorf 3-0 soured.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens was already getting the home team on track using foul penalty.
Macedonians vote on new state name
In Macedonia, some 1.8 million citizens vote today on whether to change their country's name to North Macedonia.
A yes vote could resolve nearly three decades of simmering conflict with neighbor Greece.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name, blocking any approach by Macedonia to the West.
Voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member if the referendum was a positive outcome.
Syrians in suburbia.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three pensioners, injuring them some badly as a result.
The 41-year-old asylum was ransacked in the escape alley in Alsergrund at 10pm on Friday.
When police arrived they spoke to the accused, who walked off with clenched fists on passers-by and tried to assault them, about his behaviour.
In response, the Syrians tried to beat and kick the officials.
Moments later it emerged that the suspect had struck three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists to the ground in Währinger Street at a tram stop shortly before.
He had also trampled the trio with his feet.
The pensioners were some of them seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussion.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for an as yet unknown cause," as it was said by police.
He was taken to hospital and monitored throughout during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly a year after Marriage for All came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the yes word in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered civil partnership was not eligible for them, Kahrs previously told the Bild newspaper.
"If we get married, right," he has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budget spokesman for the SPD's Bundestag faction and one of the spokesmen for Seeheim Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on opening marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had a rage speech on June 30, 2017.
So he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he meant in reference to the accidental proclamation of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
Garden Day: 400 metres of hedge cut
There was a whole lot of work ahead of the members of the Civic Association Children's House and the Society for Leprosy.
This is because around 400 metres of hedge around the gardens of the residents of Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Backed by residents, it went to work for about 12 supporters.
"We're doing this to reduce costs," Civil Liberties Union Chairman Walter Schröer explained.
And it also accumulated so much.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time but fortunately it is now just a form cut.
Because already in the spring, you've been shearing the hedge before.
The breakfast that always follows the work also has a long tradition.
"Everyone should stay with forces," Walter Schröer said.
Rio World Cup: Hannes Aigner takes gold at the canoe slalom world championships
Augsburg's Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the conclusion of the canoe slalom world championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old put in a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he still missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had already had enough rides here at the facility and it all matched today," said the London 2012 Olympic third seed.
At the finish he threw away his paddle with joy and revved both arms up victoriously - well aware it would be enough for a medal at least.
After all, he had starting four.
But the six starters remaining could not tally his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was Czech Jiri Prskavec ahead of Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Department reports this fall's first burglary attempt into a single-family home.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - this is what burglars want to take advantage of again.
For example, the Gauting Police Inspectorate reported the first burglary attempt of this autumn yesterday.
The fact that it remained in the attempt at the family home on Königswieser Strasse is thanks to the alarm system.
In fact, that went off when the perpetrators put on a hand just before 8pm on Friday.
The burglars guessed that the residents were not home.
However, the alert apparently surprised them derisively that they took flight without prey.

Bust at Hertha: Catched up by reality: Bayern versus Ajax called up
The predicament unbeatable has gone: defeat in Berlin is FC Bayern's "not going to let them."
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the tenure of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance dent under new coach Niko Kovac is in no way expected to increase to the greater autumn low for Munich.
'A week ago you still had the impression we're invincible.
Now a bit of reality has caught up with us," noted Thomas Müller after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a response for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are gasping towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year out did not score their own goal, as at the same time of pre-season two must-win games in Serie A, the table in the Football League for now lost to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final stage of the failed Carlo Ancelotti in late September 2017, yet the record-breaking must be warned.
FC Augsburg at 1-1 with their run-intensive man-versus-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle sticks over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days as the last overpowering Bayern are yet to crack.
"Those who know FC Bayern know we won't let this happen and we will do everything to make us successful again," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his native city, merely blaming his first defeat as Munich coach on the again lacklustre handling of chances.
A win against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nonetheless leave the first interim conclusion of his tenure positive before the national break - otherwise the tone is likely to tighten.
So Kovac did not undertake exceptional measures before this season's second Kings class appearance after 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After Sunday's day off, the short preparation for the second preliminary match against Ajax, which had also soured 3-0 at the start of AEK Athens, begins as planned.
"Now it's caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," national team captain Manuel Neuer announced.
As was the case after the losing cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same point, Joshua Kimmich in particular spoke plainly.
The legal defender appeared in the role as a maverick.
"I don't think that's all bad luck, we have to work it out again because we don't make the multitude of chances and make the mistakes at the back," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bayern were even behind Dortmund by five meters, which has now retaken the top by a point.
And so, with a twinkle in his eye, Kimmich at least positively appreciated that now the public debate over the supposedly unbeatable Bavarians has come to an end.
"Yeah, that's good after all," the national said.
It's already good for the league.
DFB boss in firing line: 'zil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, President Erdogan of Turkey denounces an exclusion of Mesut 'zil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB president Grindel sees mistakes but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
BERLIN - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel battled for interpretation sovereignty in the perennial contentious issue of Mesut 'zil.
After the president of Turkey heavily criticised the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
Early Sunday morning, the grindel in Mainz's ZDF "sports studio", which was strongly attacked by 'zil personally, announced consequences from the causa.
"That's where we have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have a lot of players with immigrant backgrounds in the U teams - that something like this doesn't happen again," the 57-year-old said, wanting to win a national player with no immigrant background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel again stated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
This had denounced, with sharp words, a racism towards 'zil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised mesut xzil and our ilkay.
They ostracized them from this society because they allowed themselves to be photographed with me in England," Erdogan said Saturday in Cathedral City.
Frankly, as their president, I could not digest the marginalisation of our two young men who went up to the German national team.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that this felt "reasonably handled" by the DFB, unlike xzil after the World Cup, which had been started by photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would face players in the future.
That someone says: if I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - that's not possible.
"That he has such an impression I very much regret," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
But he also does not see a basis for a return of xzil to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed alongside native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If there is one with no immigrant background that clearly affects society and football and says "the issue is important, we have to take care of that," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs locally where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the 'zil affair, he intends to run again for office as DFB president next year.
"I do my job and strive to make it as good as it gets," Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents between 10am and 1pm on Friday.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the Lauterer Height area.
This informed the pensioner that he would have driven against her car.
But there was no exchange of personnel as the 75-year-old was unable to find the lady in the car park.
A short time later, police received a telephone message about a motorist who would have gone off the road and driven against a guide post.
Referring to this, the man did not want police on the ground and subsequently drove off.
After that, the Rube Valley drove home.
However, the pensioner has proceeded in his residence where he has lived for decades, ramming a construction vehicle when he turns.
Eventually, police were able to find and stop him.
His car had significant accidental damage.
The 75-year-old made a whimsical impression and could no longer remember much.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moor fire in Meppen: Nearly 1000 troops still in action.
Some four weeks after the Moorfire broke out at a German army site in Emsland, 980 troops are still engaged in the extinguishing work.
The German army announced on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop stable, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of troops is planned, it says.
On Sunday night, an above-ground fire was discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster case was lifted, declared well over a week earlier on September 21 because of fears that the flames were putting adjacent forests and settlements at risk by wind and spark flight.
Then Thursday, it said that an assault of the fire on adjacent communities was no longer threatening.
At times, more than 1500 troops on the ground tried to get the large fire under control.
The Air Force is continuing to support work on the German military test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights using German army drones.
Reconnaissance flights with "tornadoes" are also planned for October 2 and 5, according to the German army.
The fire was sparked by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The Moorbrands' smoke flag had at times moved up to a hundred kilometres far beyond northwestern Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr will set up a contact point to take damage reports.
Initial claims for compensation had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly a year after marriage came into effect for all, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
HAMBURG - Almost exactly a year after marriage for all took effect, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.

Macedonia referendum on new state name begun
In Macedonia, the highly anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is what neighbour Greece insists on because of its northern province of the same name.
As leverage, Athens had blocked any approach by Skopje to the EU and NATO for nearly three decades.
If citizens vote yes, they will also kick-start their country's Western integration.
Elie Wiesel - the author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the United States in 2016, leaving behind a work conserving the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is designed to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be taken only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant points out.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to provide their organs in the event of death can register there.
Their wishes are then available from Swisstransplant in case of need.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be taken - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant points out.
It is believed that 15 percent of Swiss have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five per cent of cases will a card be found at the crucial moment in possible donors.
In over 60 percent of conversations, loved ones do not know the wish of the deceased.
"You then have to decide vicariously in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," Always said.
A similar registration system already exists in Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations of storing details of possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman for the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Peoples-Albert says.
"A register where people can enter their wishes - pro or contra organ donation - does not exist," she says.
German Health Minister Jens Spahn has argued for new regulation of organ donation.
Under his proposal, anyone would initially be considered an organ donor unless they or relatives object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects it.
14-year-old pupil is world champion in headroom
The 14-year-old student, Tomohiro Iseda of Japan, is a world champion in head calculation.
He faced 39 co-workers in Wolfsburg over the weekend.
Martina Flame-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue for the competition, announced Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenceslas salute from Germany finished third.
The youngest World Cup participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organises the competition every two years.
Previous tasks included: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 x 28 x 16,448,333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants faced off against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel's greeting from Lastrup demonstrated how he keeps a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In all, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the contest.
Greeting was already in Bielefeld two years ago as a then 14-year-old.
With terms like superbrain, genius or miracle baby, organizer Laue can do little.
"Head calculation can be trained," he said.
Many participants exercised for a number of hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even computational competitions in stadiums.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root pulling from six digits.
In versatility calculating, candidates get surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Germans also have a good chance here, the main referee said.
Otherwise, Asians are often at an advantage, because head calculations are learned more intensively and with other, effective methods in early childhood.
Urgent appeal: Video featuring naked Serena Williams: It's all about breast cancer screening
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows her sentient and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old aims to point out breast cancer with this video and is keen for early detection.
It is a matter of life and death, but also of courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings topless the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover up her most intimate posts.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about breast cancer screening that can save lives.
Serena Williams herself nearly died a year ago.
There were complications in the birth of their daughter, Alexis Olympia.
An emergency op was launched to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, clumps of blood were subsequently discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time ...
Government to ban more extremist symbols
VIENNA - The federal government plans to significantly expand the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turquoise Blue Coalition will send a related bill on the so-called "symbols law" under review.
This is to significantly expand the number of those terrorist or comparable groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to mountains in the west
Ms Holle shakes out her beds in the West for the first time next week: polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists at the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snow line drops to 1,500 to 1,200 metres at the start of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 metres at strong intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions therefore become wintry.
Farmers may start annual knee-jerk care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers may begin annual knee-jerk care on Monday.
The "green walls" unique in Germany have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor state for about 200 years.
The tree and stud hedges, up to five metres wide, are "forest substitutes" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats over which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the managing director of the Nature Conservancy of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks Are Living Fences
The Knicks were created based on an order from the Dane King Christian VI in 1766 that ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not just field limits and livestock fence, they also provided farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
From that time, his name also comes "Knick": by "ticking around" the branches, the dense, intertwined demarcations could develop.
Today, some 45,000 kilometres of hedgerows stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the picture of a wood-rich, diverse structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a replacement habitat by around 7000 animal species.
In a kilometre of knick, up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is appropriately maintained in winter.
Otherwise, it will wither away to a light line of trees that, in addition to biodiversity, will also lose wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
Knick care may only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March, according to the agriculture ministry.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about SItuation on the ground
The Local's Radika Pinto describes the situation on the ground on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and tsunami in the interview with the editorial network Deutschland (RND):
Were you on the ground yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
Then when I found out about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
There I arrived on Sunday morning because I still had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight as the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our "World Vision" office is destroyed, too, but we provisionally set up something where we housed other people as well.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have roamed surrounding hills where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are staying outside their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people are partially clutching food and gasoline.
The civil service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the inmates are running around partially free and finding them is difficult.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information provision going on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but this has not worked before and we have only received information over the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people they don't know whether to live and where to stay because people were traveling not at home during the earthquakes but on work, for example.
The tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "okay, no tsunami" - and then he did.
In other regions not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami is hitting the region and they have roamed the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi lying on the Pacific Ring of Fire not prepared for earthquakes?
Yet, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst here.
We normally know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuees.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has affected a great many people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must do without Aogo and Donis for long
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss VfB Stuttgart for extended periods with serious muscle injuries.
Aogo had a muscle tear in the back left thigh during 2-1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Football League announced Sunday.
At Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably still miss matches after the following national break.
VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast on downtime.
A muscle bundle usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of hyperrealism at San Seb'stian Film Festival
SAN SEBASHAN - With the San Sebastian Film Festival closing annually, the realms of Europe's most prestigious festivals.
Despite all the chants on cinema, 2018 has been a remarkable year for film.
After a compelling competition at Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that could attract much attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best contests of recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching Fire Department tried to capture an injured duck.
The action dragged on for some time, however.
Even a boat was used.
OLCHING - Walkers at Olchinger Lake fell a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
It stopped in the area of the Water Watch station.
To help the animal, passers-by called the police and fire brigade.
The first attempts to capture the duck, however, went awry.
Despite the injury, she was always able to evade the forces.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
Using a lifeboat, firefighters were able to circle the animal and push it back to shore, where it was then put into a transport crate after nearly an hour by a firefighter with a heartfelt handle.
The duck injured in the chest was then taken to LMU's veterinary clinic in Upper Wear.
But according to the initial assessments, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard pits world championship medal
Fourth at Olympia, biathlete Julian Eberhard was long in the stomach.
Next winter, the Saalfeldener will catch up with the missed precious metal at the World Cup in 'stersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old the medal up for grabs in the Pyeongchang Olympic sprint.
Seven tenths of a second ended up missing out on bronze.
"I deliberately made time to process this," Eberhard says at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the misfiring precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a big event with the Constitution, to win something.
At some point, you have to hit too.
The world championship line-up in xstersund (Swe) is Eberhard: "I've already closed the track to the heart," he recalls fondly of his fourth World Cup place in the individual race the previous year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in last year's World Cup winter in the mass start contest of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the relay, he ran second in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in turbo-tempo
Time is extremely short and the number of scheduled interrogations is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation at a turbo pace, Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the razor-thin majority for judge nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial over nuisance allegations.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline of Friday for investigators to clear up the alleged incidents dating back more than 30 years.
The latest turn in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's appeal, accompanied by a culture fight, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and first accuser Christine Blasey Ford, during which the jurist issued angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge on the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared contrary to his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who still called Thursday's heavy reproaches a "scare," initially abstained from further attacks against the women, speaking to the contrary of "happiness in misfortune."
That way, final doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
Also, the White House has extremely limited the powers of investigators.
One will specifically investigate the known allegations of two women, no more, a government representative told the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The Mobile Ried City Community Radar, installed in a "civilian vehicle" to monitor tempo, is stationed at Garden Street from Monday, October 1, according to the city community.
The Federal School Center is also located there.
The city community also operates several fixed installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after win against Mainz: One has felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief at Schalke is great after the first season.
Still, against Mainz, the factor of time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
'I've seen every ball in.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area," the Schalke 04 sports executive said - breathing.
Finally, the Royal Blues were still able to finish the close 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and therefore the first win of the season.
In fact, things could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11th had given security to head coach Domenico Tedesco's team: "In sum, the first half was good, both playing and pressing."
Don't really create a header monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours to me," Heather said: "If the team was only half as nervous as me on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to still give that out of their hands and therefore kept withdrawing.
And with man and mouse defended against Mainz.
To save the first three counts of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said Creator, who had no insubstantial part in this with his header: "I'm actually the worst header in the man-made."
But in the end, only victory matters.
The relief was palpable throughout the arena, including at Tedesco, of course.
"We wanted to start printing in the early stages and make a firework of it," Schalke's head coach said.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and bravely so we have to tackle matches over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Royal Blue missed out, rather for clearer conditions to worry about.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the bar 59/72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have become a tremor," Tedesco said: "You already felt the fear a little bit."
So I'm glad we won.
As a result, he was not the only switch-hitter.
Fischbachau: column of smoke visible in Leitzachtal 2 km
The smoke was impossible to miss.
From around two kilometres away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal Valley spotted a fire at 1.30pm on Sunday.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause police and firefighters soon found out: An unknown had lit trash on a two-square-foot area at Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it appeared that he monitored the fire for a longer time but then left the embers unattended.
And near the woods.
Thirty Fischbbach firefighters were busy pulling apart and extinguishing.
Police are now investigating arson.
Prof Dr Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Doctor Aladin el-Mafaalani.
He has again followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I've made it my mission, for many years now, to get interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfeld Treats" - the association that cooperates with the "Cultural Policy" alliance in hosting the evening.
El-Mafaalani rises very loosely in reading, describing the book's writing process, talking about how difficult it was to explain the subject intelligibly.
With plenty of gestures, hands-on numbers and one or two jokes, he brings listeners closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, do conflicts arise?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor when answering the question.
At one table sits German society, at the cat table, the first-generation migrants.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants are born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to have a say.
This leads to conflict.
The key is therefore not whether to classify yourself politically right or left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?" he points out.
Initially more bearish, then more and more the discussion round starts.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two female teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration in students.
El-Mafaalani stands in front, not on stage, emblematic of the discussion: she is level.
The sociology professor is not urging his opinion, stressing that he is talking about the average, not individual fates.
He is pleased there is interest in the issue because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing session, he still has an open ear for the questions of guests and also in the foyer, at prepared Kurdish specialties, was discussed intensively further.
Basketball: Bonn and Cast win opening-day games
The Giessen 46ers and telecom baskets Bonn have finished the first day of basketball's Bundesliga (BBL) with one home and one out.
Casting prevailed in a hard-fought game in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the central German BC.
The ambitious Bonner won at BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
First tally of the season is Alba Berlin after Saturday's 112:55 gala against Science City Jena.
Far more trouble was had at the start of the new season by German champions Bayern Munich and former series champion Brose Bamberg.
Munich already labored to an 83:77 at Ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80 on Saturday.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is apparently huge: over 100 prospective buyers have applied to buy one of the plots in Landsham South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new Landsham South area on the open market.
Mayor Roland Frick shares this.
The application phase has also been completed for the 20 plots offered by the municipality on more favourable terms or prices - similar to the previous local model.
A good 100 applications have been received, according to Frick.
"Currently the documents are being examined," in terms of application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Plieninger mayor, the goal is to have the applicants ranking the 20 plots by the end of the year and submit them to the local council.
After that, the award could be made.
A total of 50 plots for single and semi-detached houses will be created in the area in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-family homes with an expected eight units each.
The development is now all but complete, with the roads and paths soon to be paved.
A single plot of land as well as two of the multifamily homes belong to a private individual, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells most of it on the free market, 20 plots in the socially acceptable model.
The community's two multifamily homes are to be built as affordable housing, according to Frick.
With a total of 16 income-oriented homes funded by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated is created on the area of the new Landsham-South housing for about 200 people.
Not only that: now, in early October, according to Frick, the start is made there for the new construction of a nursery.
It will house three nursery and three crib groups and a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, for the start of the next kindergarten year.
So Schalke's Naldo "great sport" also succeeds on the bench
Not in the starting eleven for the third consecutive time: Still, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
GELSENKIRCHEN - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues sat not in the switchboard but on the interchange bench for the third year in a row, the understanding among many people would have been great if the nearly two-metre Brazilian had talked himself right the frustration from the soul.
But when the Leavers players gathered in the centre circle as usual after the 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05, and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Simplicity Naldo, switched and said; "We have to thank, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction his vice-captain held no grudges despite his renewed reservation existence.
Likewise, Naldo, who was hailed as the best switch-hitter last season, knows he is not actually on the sidelines with his coach - but is given a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control."
It was not easy to tell him
"It wasn't easy to tell him, I tell you that quite honestly," Tedesco reported of the moment he had told Naldo that he was not the starter.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco justified the move.
Naldo has played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can sneak through at the moment.
And that we keep everyone in the boat," Tedesco explained of the rotation, which recently also caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself an exemplary team player on the bench, too.
Sentiment in Austria's industry continued to accelerate its decline relative to the eurozone in August.
The purchasing managers' index (PMI) was 46.7 points at a 37-month low.
Across Europe, Austria nonetheless has the third best sentiment behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on its survey of 3,000 companies on Monday.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone PMI rose 1.1 to 45.1 points, still the index's 13th consecutive month below the 50 meter mark indicating growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked that threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The Greeks were bottom (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the sentiment barometer fell, but at a slower rate than in the months before.
In Spain, the index hit its highest level since March, at 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened bottom may mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry - in the third quarter, anyway - remains the number one brake on growth.
There is no quick return to the growth zone in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as much as they have since November 2011.
Companies therefore shed jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also fell more than first thought in August.
The sentiment barometer dropped to 47.6 points from 49.3 points the previous month.
Pundits initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing managers' index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are among other issues.
Tuchel's PSG team manage eighth win in eighth league game
September 29, 2018 at 7:45 PM
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel continues to rush from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At OGC Nice, the defending champion won 3-0 (1-0) thanks to two hits from superstar Neymar and was also successful in the eighth league game.
Finally, Olympique Lyon had such a good start to game time in France 82 years ago.
Brazilian Neymar brought PSG into the lead after 22 minutes and set up the final score in the aftermath.
For the two-handed 2:0, Christopher Nkunku (46th).
As a result, Paris also managed the rehearsal for Wednesday's landmark second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade.
At the start of the Premiership, Tuchel's team had suffered the only must-win defeat so far this season at 2-3 at Liverpool.
