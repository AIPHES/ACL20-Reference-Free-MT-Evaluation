Yeah, she wants to...
“Beautiful Munich” 2018 will be!
In the afternoon a surprise awaits our candidates again: they will not do the romantic candlelight shoot before MY SOLARIS alone, but alongside Male-Model Fabian!
Hvar - flirting, flirting, seducing - no simple tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine “Schöne Münchnerin” candidates deliver Tuan during the shooting with people photographer and defy wind, spray and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shooting can be found in the video:
DFB Chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
“This is a question that depends, of course, on getting into conversation, talking to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as stated in his statement,” Grindel said in the football podcast “Phrasenmower” of the “Bild-Zeitung.”
Despite the months of debate about Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92 times national player Özil.
“I would have been delighted if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed until a certain point in time that this would be the case,” Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and justified the fact that Grindel did not defend him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The head of the DFB reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with German coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it from football so much that when “you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation hasn't come about so far”.
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 14.13 p.m., the Berufsfirebrigade Linz was alerted about a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line runs directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was in default.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut on arrival in full fire.
The roof had to be removed practically completely and fire-debris to the absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery for charging at noon.
That might be the cause of the fire.
Anyway, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What has led Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, “Herbie: Fully Loaded”) streamed live how she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal “TMZ” and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see “Fortunately Kissed” with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She accused adults of trafficking in children.
For all this, she does not provide evidence in the clip.
“The whole world is seeing this right now,” Lohan can be heard in the video as she follows the family further along the street.
Apparently, she's trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the apparently angry mother.
It looks like she turns around and slaps Lohan in the face.
Under tears, the actress asserts how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has “Mascot” on the asteroid
The “Hayabusa2" probe was launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It is said to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The land “Mascot” will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
Following the severe earthquake of 7.5 magnitude followed by tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated the devastated areas and cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Chief of Tesla Supervisory Board
In the beginning there was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletro car manufacturer.
The US SEC sued him for fraud, but now both have reached an agreement.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the CEO of Tesla retires from the Supervisory Board, but he may remain Chairman of the Board of Management.
Party Congress of the British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the party convention of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The congress is about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit Hardliners, ex-Foreign Minister Boris Johnson at the forefront.
Referendum for a new state name
Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already reached an agreement
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these doubling names for years.
Now they've come to an agreement.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in future and the population will vote on this Sunday - whether it will be okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
“Ele Nao” (“The not”) - meant Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The “Trump of Brazil” stands out as an anti-system candidate and is thus leading the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: “Dieselgate” reconditioning takes longer than planned
“The diesel task force still exists,” said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer Peter Mertens to the industry journal “Automobilwoche”.
In December 2017, Audi chief Rupert Stadler, imprisoned and on leave of absence, announced that the task force will soon be disbanded.
“In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gearbox combinations are expected to be tested,” he said at that time.
Mertens said: “At the beginning of July, we reached an important stage in resolving the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer had made “serious organizational changes” so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board postpone a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and intends to discuss further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi chief of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust gas values after the emission fraud has become known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
At present, Sales Director Bram Schot is head of the company as acting CEO.
Due to the changeover to the new WLTP exhaust and consumption test standard, there are production failures at Audi, said Schot to the “Heilbronner Voice”.
In principle, he sees a declining demand for saloons such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment itself is difficult,” he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
The e-tron, the first Audi electric car, already had 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm should join the DFB presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Despite criticism of his person, Reinhard Grindel intends to run for DFB President again next year after the World Cup and the Özil-affair.
“I do my job and try to do it as well as it can,” Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning at the “Current Sports Studio” of the ZDF.
You have to try again and again for a re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it “strange” if he did not “want to work on the future project after the award for the European Football Championship in 2024.”
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who overthrew the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first complete term of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future Chief Executive of the European Championship Philipp Lahm is to be involved in the DFB presidium.
“I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will continue to advise on this role in the Bureau in the future and, of course, be invited to provide his experience on sporting matters,” said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB head.
As a consequence of the affair about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that a national player without a migration background should become the DFB integration ambassador.
Currently, this post is held by Brazilian native Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
“If someone without an immigrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says, “the issue is important, we have to take care of it,” that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our clubs on the ground where integration needs to work,” said Grindel.
Correctly lose weight with semi-clever scales
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the percentage of body fat.
Muscle and bone mass can also indicate them.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the sauces.
He doesn't tell me if I replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the basketball Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up won without problems with 112:55 (52:31) and offered over 40 minutes a convincing match.
New addition Rokas Giedraitis was top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
Johannes Thiemann (18 counters), a national player from Ludwigsburg, also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators on his debut debut.
Ex-master Brose Bamberg won the debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower in the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came to 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter in the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
In the Basketball Leuven Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings overcame the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweiger, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been a majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 race of the Baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship,” he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city centre of Cologne had been partially blocked.
Several thousand police officers were in action - among them also snipers.
The Islam Association Ditib is under criticism because it is considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
“Global Citizen Festival”: Music Against Poverty: Stars, Boot Calls and Horror Seconds
Musicians like Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more commitment to the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York Central Park.
“Engage wherever you can,” Mendes said at the festival on Sunday in front of around 60,0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, 'cause I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations, also showed themselves on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a second of horror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier for shots, got scared and tried to flee.
Shortly panic arose, people ran confused.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the people from the stage.
“No one is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the “Global Citizen Festival” concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Anyone who wanted to get one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience, but Buhrufe for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He, together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke for greater equality between men and women on stage.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke in the US Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge, thereby pushing many women before the head.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which the latter rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who claim themselves experienced sexual assaults, confronted him in an elevator on the way to the committee meeting.
“You can also meet me in an elevator anytime,” Flake said to the crowd at the New York concert.
Freedom of the press: Federal government defends the rejection of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist, who lives in Hamburg, had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription “Freedom for Journalists” and had been in the front row.
The t-shirt, had not been the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disturbance of the press conference.
The journalist's action caused a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
That's why he ordered security guards to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in jail.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or of supporting or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blamed the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested only at the beginning of September.
Most recently, the cases of imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but there are still trials against them in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show “Inas Nacht” produced by the NDR is known for lively conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour pub “Schellfischposten”.
Moderator Ina Müller tosses with her guests some beer, some wine or even more high percentage drinks to ease the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory singing deposits.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as “Men's Hearts”, “Terror - Your Judgement” or “Der Gülste Tag”.
The trip to the far north was not good for the Munich.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumpled on it, his eyes only two small slits left.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's only a mighty hangover.
To his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights he has now gained: “Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And let the round of eggnog that Ina throws at half past three, too.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips on combating post-labor.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most effective - headache pills.
Others simply had a good time at the sight of the usually attractive movie star.
It is not known how Ina Müller survived the night-time drinking.
Since she has been moderating the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and treachery
The entry into the 36 kilometre long railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hood in Treysa is difficult to find and garbage.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly noticeable.
Shards, cigarette dumps, garbage and rubbish, demolished trash cans and meanwhile dismantled signs - this is how the entry with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße-hill in Treysa has been presented for some time now.
For the flagship railway bike path in the Red Riding Hood, a more than unglorious sight.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt for some time, according to the bicycle traffic officer of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Board.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals range from the installation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
“I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible further activities,” says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been introduced to the local council.
Not only the rubbish is driving around cyclists and residents - the seating group is a regular meeting place for celebrations on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, but also destroys the walls: posts are torn out of the ground, trash cans demolished, signs bent over, seat furniture smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for drinking.
“Along the entire cycle path there is clearly the focus here at the Haaße-Hügel,” confirms the cycling officer, who is now also concerned about the new cycling centre in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
“If she suffers the same fate, it becomes really expensive”.
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: “This may make the threshold much higher than the common good.
However, this would presuppose that a police patrol will come by in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße-Hügel.
It must be made more attractive.
You could be very satisfied with the frequentation of the cycle path so far.
The tourist marketing is still extendible.
Our bike path is very high compared to others in Germany,” says the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa as an extremely critical place of danger.
There is no turn lane on the Haaße-Hill.
In case of heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between two-sided traffic flow,” she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but probably for the elderly and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The “Kö von Hiltrup” and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and coexistence.
“D a song for Hiltrup” is the appeal of the town district offensive Hiltrup, in the “music contest for young and old musicians”.
A contest “with a wink in the friendly Hiltruper family”, as Karl Franke put.
In fact, it was soon a family coexistence with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long Albachtener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the “Hiltruper Sternfarben”, three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city yet.
What did the copywriters see each other connected with?
Among the villages the Hiltruper Lake and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue “Kö von Hiltrup” in his beater-like song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also appreciated.
Again and again, it was about experiencing together in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
So people learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also taught guitar.
From sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew that he was recently performing in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has put all sorts of things on Youtube.
“It's not about winning,” Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper gastronomy.
Nevertheless, there was something special for the jury's favorites - so that others can listen to their songs as well.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hit, who impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the “Lummerland Pack”: “a very nice performance” with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children also appeared again to the final - and sounded “really good” even without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchy melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KVG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund, as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The city's district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She regarded the event as a complete success.
All were “very satisfied”, and “the atmosphere was good” in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: “Decrypto” in the game test
The players form two teams facing each other.
For each page there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which you can only decipher - the old trick with the red foil - once you put them in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the maps, for example, read from left to right: “1st Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Dice.
4. Feast ".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
This is because we want to guess not the terms, but codes.
Alternately one player per team is the encoder.
He gets a code card that might say “3.4.2. 2".
In “Decrypto” we want to guess not the terms behind the secret slide, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms “dice”, “hard” and “window” - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible, because this wins the game if he succeeds in cracking the code twice.
So the encoder notes and reads aloud: “throwing” for the dice, “loose” as opposed to festival; here, of course, something like “party” would be possible and “Prague” because he took care of the school and knows the window lintel there.
This is how it continues lap by lap, team by team.
You do not know the terms of the opposite side - but they can rhyme better with every hint that the encoder gives there.
So the rewriting should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, otherwise you will make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about “Decrypto” is the rule booklet.
The players probably have to study it quite a long time and extensively until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But if you've started, you'll be fascinated by how much emotion is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, “Decrypto” is not quite as conclusive as predecessors and genre primus “Codenames”, which also puts an agent topic on a game of fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you're just about guessing and not winning points, you can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police greeting Hitler and harassed guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspectorate Kulmbach twice on the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler greeting to a passing police patrol in the Upper Town, later he also noticed in a pub in the Upper Town when he harassed other guests.
After he did not fulfill the number of places left by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspectorate Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In a sober state, he then has to take criminal responsibility for the use of identifiers of unconstitutional organisations.
Pressig Betriebwerk was home to the Schubloks
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Franconian Forest for decades.
A piece of railway history ended in 1991.
“When buffers banged buffers, you heard it all over Pressig,” recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
Then the brakes squeaked and the wagons squeaked.
It was just railroad.
Statements that symbolise Spelt's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Franconian Forest was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which, after an ascent of about 220 meters above sea level, has its peak in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, train and thrust bloks were used earlier, which had their homeland in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprenticeship workshop, contact line and railway mastery.
“The centrepiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899,” says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and for 47 years professional railways.
The Bahnbetriebswerk (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the side lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the “Volksblatt” reported a workforce of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and thrust blocks.
From 1977 they were only used on freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 weighers were still ranked per month.
Parts of the plant were demolished in 1982 and the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: “It is unfortunate that we have not envisaged better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport”.
On Pentecost 1989, the railway directorate Nuremberg celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of “50 Years of Electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld”.
“There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here,” Georg Dinkel recalls.
A little later the end.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig shunting station was history.
“The shunters and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic,” Dinkel recalls.
Any misaction would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the InFrankenPlus article.
Kerber with China Open opening success
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings third is either Julia Putintsewa from Kazakhstan or Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Victory Lund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darya Kassatkina, when the Russian, set at number 13, gave up.
The Swabin is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach during the weekend as part of the series “Art and Enjoyment”.
With great relief registered organizers and visitors watched the ideal weather when the special vernissage “Windspiel Performance” was opened in the open grounds of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association “Around Walberla” as part of the series “Art and Enjoyment”.
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was a great enthusiasm for visitors.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be seen in Mittelehrenbach.
The landlord Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists at the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
A little surprising, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his task in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
In the past, both have actively contributed to the selection of artists and contributed to the design of flyers.
This year again, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there will be a 70 cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster “Betzn austanzen”, designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was won for the musical framing.
As you walk through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title “Wind Chime Performance” challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with color accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor on the right side is the “Glückbaum” by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully equipped with 20 wind wheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the bush in the background, the object looks fabulously sunbathe and invites you to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental, who prefers to dedicate herself to the event 15 years of K & G in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts, moving in the wind.
Halfway through Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work “The Wind the Heavenly Child”.
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy structure made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme of “wind chime performance” for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - this was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albachtenes also blew up their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to resign to the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir “Cäcilia” there should be no sangesleben in the district.
Meanwhile, it has become a legend: at a bench in the Tnenbusch, they baptized the MGV 68 Albachten.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the “House of Encounter”.
“It will be full today,” Chairman Jürgen Holstiege suspected, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachtener singers.
They had resurrected the foundation festival especially for the anniversary.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it became, for festive clothes had been asked before.
The guests did not sit as usual in the “Haus der Encounternung” in rows of seats, but comfortably at tables.
In between, there was a call for movement: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the regulators and asked to the dance floor.
It is a matter of honor that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten made the voice sound themselves.
To match the occasion, cheerful songs were announced.
Almost already set: “Such a day, as beautiful as today”.
To match the exquisite grape juice, which many had before them, there was the “Rüdesheimer Wein”.
In allusion to another cool drink, “Humulus lupulus” sounded, which is the Latin term for “hops”.
The choir conducting of Richard Homann, who is one of the fives who were in the Tannenbusch at the time was sovereign.
“It's just fun to sing under his direction,” Holstiege said: “He has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece that he performs”. By the way, this time not only men presented themselves singers.
The Women's Choir “Hohes C” was also guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.
After all, there was still poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had been sitting at the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a big raffle.
The proceeds are intended to finance the children of the Albatros Youth Centre a visit to the All-Weather Zoo.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the “dream ship” Heide Keller became a star.
Now she talks openly about the fact that the series could have had a complicity in her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the “dream ship” made Heide Keller famous (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went off board forever.
The series, which made her star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
“That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues perceived me at eye level,” Keller tells in conversation with the “Bild am Sonntag”.
At first, she was always only “the wife of Hans von Borsody”, but that had changed with the “dream ship”.
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
“I don't know if he liked it so much”.
She considers it possible that her husband at the time might have been jealous, but “like many men, Hans also shy talks about problems and feelings”.
Keller always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have prefigured myself ", as she further explains.
She had always felt “not good enough for him.”
He saw in me an emancipated woman I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever ".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, “although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time.”
The day before the civil ceremony, I was crying in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why never did it work with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love back then “as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I approached love far too naively ".
The moth, who regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ department in Zurich, dared to visit the ZFF opening party this time.
Our moth is not a moth, but still a little light-shy.
And the bright splendor of a green carpet in Sechseläutenplatz dazzles it overly.
But it's just a film festival, because more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
This late Thursday night, he's goggling across the square to ease himself in the “AquaClean Toilet Oasis”.
This is the name of the public toilet facility, sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The Neednisanstalt on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
That evening, however, it stinks to heaven in the Men's Oasis for some reason.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who entertained the opening film “Green Book” in the cinema next door, celebrate the start of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as is known, the works shown come from all over the world.
What you don't have to come up with in an article about this festival so as not to fall into sneak advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a ribbon around the feelers, which a good fairy has plugged him, and two bullish bouncers actually wave him in generously.
Inside, the invited crowd, they dance far after midnight to live music, or let DJ pretend rhythms to which they yell at each other, and flush down exquisite appetizers with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters are waiting for sipping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut open and a chocolate fountain bubbling.
And the hammer is: all the retail shelves of fully exclusive products have not been dispensed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The moth studies the shield at the escalator: “Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator”.
If that's two separate instructions, he's wrong in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it certainly has saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the winged person tilts a cocktail prepared with espresso called “Golden Eye”, corresponding to the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been adverting for that brand for years, isn't here that night either.
But there, between local celebrities, cash table and kitchen items, a face that seems familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His protagonist shouldn't be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty almost acting like a choir boy, walks through the crowd.
He's not being talked, not gazed, you just look steally.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as jamming, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is pleased about the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57 year old coach danced to Cumbia rhythms with a player in the cabin, as can be seen in a video released on Saturday.
Maradona dances in a 15-second clip of a team member in a yellow jersey, fueled by the players.
The Mexican second league had defeated the Leones Negros by 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game Maradona called into a TV camera “Always with my guys, always”.
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV sending after last minute broke “destroyed on the ground”
Swen Bieletzki, coach of handball club player ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: “Such a bitter defeat”. His proteges were “destroyed on the ground” after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long phases, the sendener.
Only the initial stage “we totally overslept”, the ASV coach angered.
The owners quickly led with 8:1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken, did not fruitfully at first.
“But then suddenly a jerk went through the team,” Bieletzki summarized the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the backlog was only two goals.
Above all, Senden's best, Marius Hintze, met once and again in the phase.
After the change, it became even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst retreated at 15:15, followed by the relay changer almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29:26).
And then?
The impartial intervened in the action.
Bieletzki usually beware of looking for the guilt of others.
But: The 120-second penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff collected was “a joke”.
LIT had laughed well and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well against seven men in the back and threw them on the empty gate again and again.
Only they can buy little for compliments.
“Now a bloody victory has to come,” says Bieletzki, who is completely served.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (district of Hof), the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
Emergency forces dug up a street near Marxgrün on Saturday.
To this end, the road covering and several layers underneath were removed, as the police and the prosecutor jointly reported.
According to new findings, the missing person may have been buried not far from their place of residence at that time.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
At that time, the investigators did not presume a crime.
Since last year, the criminal police Hof, together with the prosecutor's office, has been working intensively on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators encountered an obscurity under the street near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials narrowed the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking in the net.
However, users can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letters, users should prefer to use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, such as Windows, should be installed quickly, and it does not hurt to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities Supervisory Authority (SEC) filed an out-of-court dispute over misleading Twitter news in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk also resigned the post of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German Supervisory Board.
He is allowed to stay against it.
In the settlement, which still has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager before the US Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer who is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of guilt
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed at the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange and pay $420 per share, and the funding was secured.
Tesla would have been valued at $72 billion in total.
Later, Musk rowed back: Tesla stay on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla now needs to find an outside chairman, hiring two independent board members, and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.

The team of controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United earned 1:3 (0:2) and remains in the table midfield with ten points after seven days of play.
Pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of the Champions League match on Tuesday against FC Valencia.

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel as Chancellor until 2021
After the quarrels of the past weeks, GroKo collects several survey lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD overtook the SPD nationwide for the first time in the Emnid-Sunday trend for Bild am Sonntag.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD has increased by one counter to 17 percent, the SPD has one point compared to the previous week and ends up at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
According to Emnid, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would get only 43 percent of the vote.
As a result, the large coalition has now lost the majority on the Sunday issue in all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The ruling parties consistently reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
At the 2017 Bundestag elections, they received a total of 53.4 percent.
Among the other parties, the range is also wide: the AfD, the second strongest party in several polls, reaches 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach votes ranging from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, while the FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent upwards and downwards, depending on the proportion of votes.
But the support of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BAMs revealed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) wants the large coalition to hold in three years until the next regular Bundestag election, 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
A further survey published on Saturday also saw significant loss of popularity for Merkel.
In a split way, the Germans also assess whether Merkel should again run for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, while 44 percent are against.
In the case of the Union's supporters, 64 percent do not want a candidacy, 35 percent would not.
Posting at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in the times of Tinder, there are no more romantic stories to get to know - they should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital “fast food dating” by Tinder and Co., the supermarket is an anachronistic romance as a place to get to know great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short bargain at the voles table or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being a slippery exchange rather than a contact exchange.
We dared the test: how do women react, you do not talk about the hot porridge for a long time in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
It has true Hollywood love potential when love happiness is preceded by an out-of-the-eye, lost and recovered plot.
If the guy gets back to his worshiped person at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, it sounds very like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Konsorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
For example, the author of this advertisement in an unknown Aldi branch is to wish that she will find her dream man with whom she briefly conversed about the “30 percent reduced organic turkey meat”.
For believing in the magic of analogue learning, she definitely deserves her happy ending à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis

Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion on form and fitness of Mario Götze.

Football: Bezirksliga: Researchers appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went hard to court with his own.
He gave himself the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, first retired (internally) to ponder the lack of a willingness to perform on the green.
It's all history.
Meanwhile, it runs around the Brandhoveweg again.
Taufrischer proof is the 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the past season only swept past the climb.
Yes, I am very pleased with the performance.
“We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen,” Fetsch praised his boys, looking for each and every one of them to say “thank you” for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system changeover after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in the front line.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his end (17th), the traded Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost this would have taken revenge when the SCA, at minute 41, beat twice in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box - goalman Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL cheekly took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters barely failed.
Schroer was too late after 58 minutes on a Thewes-entry.
With the exchange of Miles Geske, Fetsch missed a fresh cell cure on the left.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute of Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick 18 meters in front of the guest house.
The foulte himself came up and demonstrated his danger in standards.
Westhues” Thing with the right slit hit the bottom left from the point of view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty minutes left, which should be bloody long.
And then this: VFL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty area unhappily to the hand in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wange Minutes had to survive in the final phase, before Geske had the victory on the Puschen in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
During the landing, an accident occurred at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2pm on Sunday there was a drama at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
The landing of a helicopter resulted in turbulence, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The helicopter was caught by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a halt on the side.
Immediately police, rescue and fire brigade were notified.
With a large lineup, the emergency forces came to the accident site.
The ÖAMTC emergency medical helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one property damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to go home independently.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and the subject of the investigation.
According to fire brigade spokesman Franz Resmerger, there was a small fire that could, however, be extinguished quickly.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the boards were female as of September 1, as shown in the report “Die Macht der Monokultur”, which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was presented to the German Press Agency in advance.
“Companies will have to change their position, otherwise international competitors will pass by them,” said Wiebke Ankersen, Managing Director of the Foundation.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely masculine leadership teams - with a few exceptions - have long since been conceivable.
The backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies is also due solely to positive impulses from the companies of the medium-sized index (MDAx).
According to Allbright data, only 6.8 percent of the Board of Directors are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was 3.8 percent.
The proportion of women has stagnated among the 30 DAX companies - pioneers in recent years.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
“I am sure that the DAX companies will again recruit more consistent women in the coming year - in their own interest,” Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would continue to make no commitment to increase the share of “zero percent” so far.
The supervisory boards show a different picture: as of September 1, the proportion of women was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
“If an equal number of women were recruited to the board every year, a share of 40 percent would have been achieved by 2023,” the report says.
Some even make bad: luxury cars: which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves best.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with every Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noble providers makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
“Autopapst” and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros operating profit with every car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, comes only to around 800 euros, while Tesla and Bentley are even strong on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices ranging from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

Torchlight procession for the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Wine Festival
With a torchlight procession, the tourist association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session.
For the 60th time, the association organises the wine festivals, which are now rising every Saturday in October in the large marquee on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, the responsible persons moved through the town to the festival place under the sounds of the Spielmannszuge from Wiesenbronn.
The chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe greeted the guests in the already propensive marquee. “To do something like this for 60 years - this is an amazing achievement for a small village with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that,” Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later appeared symbolically with the guests from the stage.
“It's nice that so many have found their way to Abtswind”. Later, “The Troglauer” created a mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set the beverage prices as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival takes place on Friday, 5 October, in the House of the Guest, before it goes to the second round one day later in the marquee.
In Bonn: emergency car crashed into taxi
An ambulance car is heavily damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passerby was fatally injured.
If emergency doctors are called, they should help - best to save lives.
Such an ambulance took a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of an emergency car with a taxi, a 26 year old pedestrian was fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and her driver were seriously injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency medical car had run over a red traffic light with blue light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then met at a crossroads with the taxi that drove near Green.
After the collision, the doctor's car threw a traffic light pole and a tree.
He captured the passerby who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of the emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be released by emergency forces.
The 29 year old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but she could no longer help the pedestrian.
Another called emergency doctor tried to do this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police investigate who is responsible for the accident in close coordination with the Bonn Public Prosecutor's Office.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we it uncomfortable
After the embarrassing end of the League Cup, Manchester United now also loses in the 7th round of the Premier League.
West Ham United is subject to ManU 1:3. The way of defeat is likely to be something to speak.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute when the recovered Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Because they suspected an offside on Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester defensive players stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of a previously insufficient performance for long distances.
At the moment, the mood at United's City Trivale Manchester City is quite different.
The Citizens trained by Mourinho's big competitor Pep Guardiola came to a safe 2-0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the defensive bar of the outsider for the first time for the home team.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalscorer, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh match, and thus the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the league, Xherdan Shaqiri fought a 1-1 against Chelsea in the Premier League with Liverpool.
Like the cup off, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in the London.
The goal of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, just missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his pusher.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea was undefeated for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and the Blues Liverpool fell from the top of the league.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, where Granite Xhaka played through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success report against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart buxed an unhappy entry of Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal passed Watford thanks to the fifth consecutive victory and is now right behind the big rival Tottenham in 5th place. A strong impression continues to be left by promoter Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained undefeated for the fifth consecutive season in the 2-0 against Southampton in the league, finishing 8th place.
VW Core Brand Missing: Paris Motor Show in Signs of Diesel Debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet ubiquitous: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, together with competitors from all over the world, they will be presenting their new products in the French capital from next week.
The diesel does not actually play a major role in this.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should nevertheless be an important issue at least behind the brilliant scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: Although the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, it is not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here, including their first pure electric models: the e-tron of Ingolstadt is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
But both were officially presented.
BMW's iNEXT is scheduled to start only in 2021.
The focus in Paris is the new 3.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service providers and software providers are present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a good one million visitors came.
In the severe earthquakes and the subsequent tsunami, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first earthquake was 5.9 and the second was 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged and enormous property damage has been caused.
After the earthquakes, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims is still significantly higher.
Until now, the figures are only from Palu.
However, numerous other municipalities are also affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate divine service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final divine service for the motorcyclists in the Church of Peace in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Church of Peace in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for the bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong bicyclists.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at Haus Nordhelle on the last Sunday of a month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Church of Peace in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to do anything but ordinary worship.
Already from 10 am the cars were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
Initially, the biker early was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MOGO team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was held during the biker service by Father Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical accompaniment.
“Although bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill is more poetic and calm,” says Father Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a big festival: after the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active during the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice to his astonishing viewers.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how it should become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step in the work this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in molds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces layer by layer, which look a little like chipped material.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was not so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Füchtorfer farmer also had ready-bottled specialities with him.
So he opened his “treasure chest” and presented to the older visitors the latest feather white.
The demand for the good drop “Made in Füchtorf” was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents started talking, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built bouncy castle for themselves.
Active members of the Füchtorfer camaraderie of former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
The Heimatverein will also offer a day of action in the coming year.
But then, according to Gregor Krützkamp, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of action.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: after all, it will go round the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season broke: “Schissene situation”
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat one after the other, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 and gave them courage.
However, much positive was not seen before at the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
“It's a crappy situation, but you have to get out of there as a team,” said 96 football pro Pirmin Schwegler, pushing: “Of course, this is disappointing, because you always do a lot of things.”
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) met, are at the bottom with two counters and are a candidate for relegation in their current constitution.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated its first home victory in the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators, who, after the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa-League match against Lazio Rome, scored seven points in the midfield of the table.
Croatia's Vice-World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse in his starting eleven debut and never to get control of Hanover's defense.
The striker, who has long been stripped after the World Cup, showed with his speed and assertiveness why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, Brazilian Allan, borrowed from FC Liverpool, was the first time in the early lineup of the Frankfurters, who began to swing.
A header of Lucas Torró (17.), falsified on the net, brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defense around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a defended corner, Haller extended his head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the French second-league AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt followed before the break.
This time, Haller matched his stormpartner Rebic, who skillfully reassed himself and left 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
Hannover Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak performance of his elf and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played a little more courageous forward, but sparing ideas remained out until just before the end, when the follow-up hit succeeded.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After less than an hour, Rebic started a solo and then moved across De Guzmán, who had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only show-running for the Frankfurters against overwhelming guests, and Jovic also met one minute before the end.
Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city center.
Mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter made it in front of millions of visitors at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two strokes.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Feast
The Catholics of Geisinger celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on September 14 or on the Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, followed by a procession to the Church of the Holy Cross with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross is home to the Christ shot, which is from the Thirty Years' War and which, according to legend, a Swedish soldier shot.
Blood flowed from the gunshot wound.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
This is still not finished, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the importance for the Geisinger parish, the divine service was badly attended.
After the divine service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and with the final blessing the church part of the Cross feast ended.
For many years, the Catholic Church Choir invites to the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish home.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm holidays.
In the afternoon, the parish community offered guided tours around the town church. Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the building measures that will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders were prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become larger, but more has been identified, which was only possible through the inspection by means of scaffolding.
The plinth plastering work has been completed, before winter the work of natural stone is to be started and it is hoped to finish just over half of these works this year.
Inauguration: New dorm in the Neu-Ulm Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new dormitory for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that “a very special house” is now handed over to its destination in Münsterblickstraße - all those present agreed at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residence of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officer building of the US Army was put to the test for the residents with Handycap: “The house had been old and no longer in its equipment,” Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators came to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new dorm
Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and financial terms.
The Managing Director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, thanked him for this too.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without outside help.
Similarly, Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, said: “The house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants, who need tools to be mobile”.
The comfort and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: “The plot in this location is a real godsend, because so in today's situation it can no longer be acquired”.
In total, the new dormitory on Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three residential groups on almost 1500 square metres.
Lebenshilfe-Managing Director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariff.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before Unity Day, the deputy SPD president Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to reconcile themselves with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences,” said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to the “Tagesspiegel am Sonntag”.
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than the people in West Germany, but would get 15 percent less salary.
“I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German Unity,” Schwesig said.
North Korea: Is this cute dog ending the Koreakonflikt?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungan hunting dogs as a gift.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs about a year old reached their recipient on Thursday.
They then passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to make it easier for the animals to “get used”.
Dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North had announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to compete in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent “Bilderbuch” Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to work in things - this is the unofficial motto for the Grand Coalition's working week, which begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, the SPD and also from the CSU have not recently conjured the “return to work in kind” mantra.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other workers in this country to the legitimate question of what actually is the difference between work and tangible work, but be it.
When the federal government is now ready to rededicate itself to its mandate - to governing - it should not be prevented by debate on concepts.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and embarrassing of the last few weeks, may already be shown on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the government parties meet to form the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly in order to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all this dispute.
First of all, however, the diesel retrofitting and the skilled workers immigration law are again on the agenda for conflicting issues.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to make the car companies get away with exchange premiums as a sparse, while the SPD and CDU see manufacturers as a duty to retrofit older diesel engines.
While the diesel crisis has seen a rapprochement over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned immigration law for skilled workers.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or are training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the 'change of lanes' from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be again a dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be otherwise?
It is not equal and equal to GroKo, but three partners with some very different social images and priorities.
Quarrel is good.
Without a dispute, a society characterised by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not progress.
However, in order to be constructive, the dispute must not be rebuilt on the question of being or non-being for party reasons.
This is still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD should argue - but always keep an eye on the reality of life of the people.
What is feasible and benefits many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and lane change issues can be clarified pragmatically - thus regaining confidence.
Above all, that is why the popular parties must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in focus
Does the Minister of Labour of all people violate the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
“Really day and night” their legists had been working on the social security reform, reported an exuberant Social Minister at the presentation of them two weeks ago.
In Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is astonished - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via question.
She assumes that “the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the deployment of her team and in no way announce violations of applicable service law in front of running cameras”.
Nevertheless, she now has questions to “release Har tinger from any suspicion”.
Police open a street in search of female body
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was preceded that the investigators had previously used an archaeological dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with his guide, was able to narrow the relevant place to a few metres.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of this street piece.
For more than a year, prosecutor's office and criminal police court have been working on the missing person case.
Again and again a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heike's body could have been buried in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But there are riots before that.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and the police took place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked with paint powder by the independence advocates, among other things, to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3000 officials from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honour their colleagues who were in action last year in the referendum, which was classified as illegal in the polling stations.
There was violence at that time when attempting to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and the central security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the 6000 separatists would have tried by force to break through the police chain and threw paint bags and eggs at the officials.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, according to the authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split off the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had put Catalonia under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also settled abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement continue to be in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
Following the entry into office of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the “right to self-determination” of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Gathered perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate goalless
Red-white ahlen continues on the spot.
At FC Gütersloh, too, it was only enough for a 0:0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators at the Heidewaldstadion, the tail light and the third last, they turned out to be a collective perplexity.
The first half was very manageable by the entertainment factor.
Therefore, anyone who would rather get a beer or a bratwurst could do this without concern.
There was no danger of missing a chance to score, because there were practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) shot of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - option was the Ahlenians, when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty line.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, and Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel aimed just above the housing from 18 meters and after an hour, the Gütersloher appeared offensively for the first time.
After a shooting by Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed.
Nick Flock (62.) “crowned” the swiftly recited counter-against Sinan Aygün with a flap shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they took a header from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball of ex-ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, initially brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
The Ahlenians did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it didn't get anything.
Angelo Daut tried to emphasize the positive: “I like that we played to zero”. But unfortunately, the zero was also in the front.
“This time we weren't as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede and that even though our opponent didn't want to play here,” said RW Ahlen's interim trainer.
Offensively, everything “bounced so a bit” against a team that just wanted to defend.
Anyway, I didn't feel we could get a clean sheet,” says Daut.
To his sorrow, however, the audience didn't feel like his team could score a goal.
The idea was too meager for that.
Reckenfelder Thanksgiving Market: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder table outlets for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: “These donations will also remain in Reckenfeld”.
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, while the square was still a bit empty, but that was supposed to change during the day.
Because: “It's so sociable here, that's why we're here today,” said a visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent touch of humor.
Ferdi and Marcel Kremer jumped in short notice for the couple Brockmann, who was supposed to be weighed up against food.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kremer) has fallen ill.
But there are plenty of Kreimers.
And the “substitute” could not be taken to entertain the more and more visitors musically.
This was so good that at the later hour some folk songs were sung along.
“Just great,” Marcel Kremer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is delighted with the many active people with their stands, including mostly clubs.
“Actually, there shouldn't be anything like a blackboard,” he thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the dedication of all those who were in use at the stands and included the other festivities held in September and the “Clean up” campaign.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful paint - here's something.
Then the May wreath was taken by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarters.
Many stands have been worked for the physical welfare.
From sweet to savoury everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his cutting saw.
Veneer work, beer mats with Reckenfeld motifs and a lot more he had on offer.
Three Reckenfelder beekeepers offered a specialty: “Reckenfelder Honey”, brought along by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter also has a specialty.
Honey cake in the jar, of course with honey from my own production.
Since the little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that allowed visitors to linger long into the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the Autumn Festival.
Lubrication with local political message: no successful advertising for skatepark
In Lengerich, unknown people have hardly promoted the construction of a skate facility.
According to Jürgen Kohne of the municipal administration, on request from the WN, there are several places to do this.
In at least one case has been brought to the police for damage to property.
In large letters the three words “Skatepark for Lengerich!” were printed on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the professional election fair on 19 September, a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign on the staircase to the Gempt bistro had been discovered.
Since the short message was apparently left “only” with an edding at the time, it could easily be removed.
“A few days later, this was again sprayed on,” says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign has to be replaced.
A special note is given to this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate facility is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the blackboard.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate equipment.
After the old LWL clinic had been dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the majority of the Council in favour of the fire brigade parking lot.
However, this approach has not been implemented - too many factors seem to be opposed to a construction at this point.
At the end of June there was a turnaround.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School grounds.
Jürgen Kohne says on the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word then has the city council.
It assumes a decision this year, so that in the event of a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Air Traffic Control bottleneck gets worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg Following the European aviation chaos in the summer, the German air traffic controllers do not see any signs of improvement in the coming year.
“This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes,” said Matthias Maas, head of the trade union of air traffic control, the German press agency, before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
One important reason for the numerous delays and flight outages is the long-known personnel shortage in European air traffic control systems, for which there is no quick solution.
“The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years,” the trade unionist said.
The market for fully trained pilots has been swept out throughout Europe.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace, around a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized the fact that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the federal government, the states, air traffic control, airlines and airports meet in the Hanseatic City on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
“If you want to talk about additional working density and overtime, that will not work without us,” explained the head of the GDF, which has many members at the German Air Traffic Control.
Maas once again blamed instructions from the EU Commission for the pilot misery.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings in national air traffic control systems have now been fully effective in operating business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that “do not cut the air even further” the air traffic control systems.
At present, the EU guidelines are being voted on by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is exposed to constant lobbying pressure on the part of airlines.
“Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years,” Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs for airlines led to a change of thinking.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a “coherent training and future pact,” said Maas.
The previously announced admission of 120 pilot pupils annually over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related retirements.
The necessary personnel construction isn't connected with it yet.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group Renovation
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans for the restructuring of the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board of Management at the Sunday meeting, the crisis group is to be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies should be based in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should not be an additional reduction in staff beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two resignations, the controlling body on the capital side has only eight heads.
This is the case with ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
Among other things, the new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business with lifts and subcontractors will be bundled.
Barcelona: Violence at demos by police officers and Catalan independence advocates.
In two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona, there have been violent confrontations with numerous injured people.
According to the city council, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police had tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a large number of teams.
According to the emergency forces, however, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and throwing bullets.
According to the information, there were also wrestling between the participants of the various protest moves.
According to emergency services, 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had taken action almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Civil Guard find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they do.
The protesters perceived it as a provocation that the Spanish police officers were demonstrating in Barcelona of all places.
“Why did they come here to protest?” , 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez asked the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they threshed us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, dismissed the accusation.
“Of course, we want to support our comrades, who last year did only their duty: to defend the law,” he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona, because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues had “not come to provoke,” the police officer assured.
Breakdown allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A security vulnerability in a mobile app has meant that the personal data of ministers and deputies of the British Conservative Tory party was temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the breakdown became known one day before the Tory Congress in Birmingham.
Two people pinched on B217
The Hannover police report a serious road accident on the Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people were killed driving their car into a tree.
The car is currently on fire.

Football: Juve coach praises after top game: Ronaldo's best match
The Portuguese star striker had “played the best match together with the half hour of Valencia this evening,” juve-coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after the record champion's 3:1 (1:1) victory against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive purchased star was the decisive man in the important match against the pursuer even without his own goal.
“Ronaldo had a lot of fun and did it well,” Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game after the early backlog of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and suspended the worst pursuer for the time being.
The goalscorer, taken by Real Madrid, initially placed on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26/49.).
And Ronaldo did the preparatory work for the hit of Defense Chief Leonardo Bonucci (76th) after a corner with a header, who had only to push in shortly before the goal line.
“He gives many templates,” praised the coach.
But, of course, Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
“We need to get even better at serving it,” the coach demanded.
Best Juve scorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' supredominance seems to become even more overwhelming.
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six points advantage over Naples.
The second table, trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the reprimand of the already warned Mario Rui (58th), the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to get off the square after getting too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
“We played well against a good Naples,” commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German national player has prevailed with Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool, was in action in all seven league matches.
The midfield editor also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri meant by “half an hour”: Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the Turin 2-0 victory and is closed for the home match on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes its name
With a particularly whimsical appearance, Rapper Kanye West attracted attention at the US TV show “Saturday Night Live” on the weekend.
Among other things, his performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change of name in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, he could only be called “Ye”, says the musician.
“The creature, formerly known as Kanye West,” he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince when he took his stage name.
The pseudonym, however, is not a news.
Already the tenth album appeared under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that “Ye” had a religious meaning for him.
“I think “Ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means “you”, says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
We did it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was simply more gripping, we almost never put him in trouble ". The list of Hoetmar shot possibilities reads correspondingly thin.
Grade times two scoring chances in 90 minutes, so only rarely games can be played positively.
Football circle league A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first round, but the first one was using Maik Krause from a sharp angle for the early lead (7th).
In the 43rd minute Steffen could have raised Uphus, but after great preliminary work by Krause he danced freely standing.
The hosts only had a double opportunity when Moritz Höne first failed to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all forgave.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could also not use it for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide poked the ball over the line was the match decided (81).
“We had criticized ourselves before, and that was different today than in the last few weeks,” said Florian Kraus.
Broadcasting: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
“I don't know what to think of it,” he struggled for words.
“We didn't get access to them at all.” By these he supposedly meant the wing-forceps with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all other green-whites who noticed with collective urge for offensive.
He still laughed: “A dirty victory,” he said, winking cheekly and pulling away from there. His players, on the other hand, had the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for class preservation.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
“This was by far our best season performance,” he says.
“How we get back after the 0:2, how we stand against one of the top teams in the league over the entire season, that was really phenomenal.”
It seems all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He put the 2:0 on the left side exemplary for Fabian Fröhning (39th).
We knew that, but a player like this can't be completely taken out.
“That was madness what he did,” Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of the opponent without envy.
Shortly before the change, his own eleven managed to compensate: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long Toreck (45.).
After the change of the page, it was McGill again, who scored the balance (59.).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann eated (69.).
Despite the surplus, Albersloh failed to counter the last Concordia hit (80th) again.
We must now focus our full focus on Wednesday.
“The game against shapdets, that's what we now have to win,” said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg won point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.

Media: The entire presidium of Dynamo Dresden resigned
The entire presidium of football second-league Dynamo Dresden has resigned according to media reports.
In the evening, several media voiced a joint letter from the Board of Saxons.
A confirmation of the association was initially not available.
The reason for the withdrawal is to be internal power struggles with the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many thought he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was a guest there.
This is how Academy Director Udo Hahn calculated him when he proudly said: “All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us”. The fact that celebrities are constantly appearing at the Academy in Tutzing was also a topic in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective. On September 29, writer Frido Mann will attend a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged to receive the “Tolerance Prize” awarded to him personally in Tutzing by the Academy, which is also given to television presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 will have it all in itself.
“The pension is not safe!” is in a conference title.
“SOS at Europe's borders” - this is how the Academy describes the “risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean”.
“And to a meeting on Syria: “barbarism without limit”.
Weapon deals, destruction, torture, death - the war mockes any humane idea ".
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change of work through digitalization.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: “A free democracy needs places where civil society can come together to search for solutions or at least partial solutions”.
At a meeting on the 200th
The birthday of Karl Marx soon awaits more visitors in the direction of capitalism criticism, the others are more likely to have a tendency “from the left to the middle”.
What does it look like with neutrality?
“We are 100% a daughter of the Protestant Church,” said Head of Studies Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, “so we are not 100% neutral”.
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
“Suitable for both adults and men” was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret tester, Teubner opted for gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of the heart for the (perceived) woman and the (felt) man and whatever else there might be, but also with music.
She used the mini guitar and mastered her violin as well.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to words until the end of the movement, and on the other hand a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner is so congenially harmoniously accompanying Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wanted a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, in the same way as the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: The satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: What would have emerged from Mozart's composing if “Nannerl” had opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, Süverkrüp glides in improvisations, from Bach's “O Haupt full of Blood and Wounds” into the “Song vom Tod”, and from Mozart's G minor Symphony into a playful dance.
There was big applause and “bravo” from the full hall.
Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, presented flowers to the Chansonets.
But President Heidemarie Markenbeck did not allow an additional thanks to him.
She had the idea to treat the duo in Wolbeck as well as performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlener women had problems especially with third league player Carolin Stallmann, who scored ten goals alone.
“Actually, I was very happy with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We did not get a grip on these,” says ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many exuberant opportunities.
The concentration in the final made his team miss this time.
The ASG was therefore almost behind a backlog until the end, lying behind the break at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45.).
Only towards the end did the broader bank of the hostesses make itself felt decisively.
In addition, Aydogdu put back room Merle Klement on left-wing wing wing, which then made “extremely clever the decisive goals” (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd Liga Women: Top performance of BSV Ostbevern in top match at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd Liga West.
In the second-league relegation VC Allbau Essen, the blue-whites won 3-1.
“This was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
This is what we have now worked out,” coach Dominik Münch rejoiced after an almost impeccable performance of his team at the downed league leader.
The first round dominated the guests almost at will.
Above 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the runner-up of the previous year with 25:15.
Essen assumed in the double bar, but didn't come into play.
We've been busy with them.
Our opponent has pitched at high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second movement, the BSV already led at 12:8. “Essen has switched the assumption to triple bars.
We couldn't hold the impact pressure.
Essen sucked up, and we got a little lull,” Münch continues.
At 18:17, the volleyball women from the Ruhr region had their nose ahead for the first time.
Although Ostbevern replied four set balls at the 19:24, the fifth attempt found his goal.
“The game was now a class better,” said the practitioner at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV turned the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: “We played consistently and quietly”.
About 7:3 and 15:13 the blue and white passageway brought four to their side with 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's inauguration of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne.
“The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a heap of shard in the German-Turkish relations, which can only be brought together with difficulty,” said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German side would have missed the chance for a joint, conciliatory appearance.
“Instead of emphasizing the Muslims” affiliation with Germany side by side with top German politicians, Erdogan used the deadline for his purpose,” complained Sofuoglu.
The wide-ranging exclusion of the German public has “strengthened many reservations”.
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break, Folktreff-time is finally again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 pm, the Heimatverein Nottuln is already hosting its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the Kaminzimmer der Alte Amtmannei.
Almost exactly the day it was a year ago that we held a folk meeting for the first time.
Meanwhile, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln,” says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I didn't think that our Folktreff would be so fast in Nottuln.
Whether Stormtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the Kaminzimmer der Amtmannei was always full.
“As always, the program at the next Folktreff is a colourful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits,” says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites musicians to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer pledged his accordion for the first Folktreffen “birthday”.
For many years he was a member of “Gaitling”, a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, who played music with flat German lyrics.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff like to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten enthusiastic listeners with his international version of the song “Frogs in the Night” and sent them home with an earworm.
“We expect many cheerful guests to once again have a sociable and humorous evening”, says the invitation of the home association.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to participate actively is invited to participate.
Since the sought-after seats are always occupied quickly, it is recommended to be there in time enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 pm, but admission is already at 7 pm.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking a further step forward on the road to becoming the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This means that the billion-dollar merger still has permits in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA.
Lastly, the chances of approval were improved there, according to an insider, because Linde promised to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125th anniversary of the Kreisverband für Horticulture und Landespflege was celebrated.
On 29 September 1893, the last founding impetus for the Kulmbach County Association for Horticulture and Landespflege were set with a fruit show at the Kulmbach Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbach Stadthalle.
Of course, he was named differently at that time: as the “Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land” it was christened by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit building association was also different from today's work - it was actually about fruit growing, and nobody thought about flowers and horticulture at that time.
“At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites,” explained district hometown Günter Dippold in his lecture.
Fruit trees were supposed to line highways, schools were used to create so-called industrial gardens.
Fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But this means that the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as communicating knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group “Mole” showed entertaining on stage how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
“Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age,” said district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
The chestnut gathering was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that with Smartphone & Co. you can collect a similar amount of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with district councillor Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
“Where they should be, the Kreisverband decides,” added Landrat Söllner, highlighting the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district, also the district managing director and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun left no doubt about this.
He guided the many visitors with a picture presentation through the long history of the Kreisverband and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was dosed.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
“Nature persists, it was already there before us and we have to be guided by it,” the expert advocated for fruit and walnut trees.
Therefore, there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to subside, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
Wolfram Vaitl added the President of the Bavarian National Association, who welcomed the new citizens in our associations.
“We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe that to our children and grandchildren,” Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower blades of the music club Thurnau.

Priority for Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister moves UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: they provide both trading partners with an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister now gives the trade agreement absolute priority - and postpone her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the pressure of time struggling for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico, the Canadian Secretary of State Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the Minister will not speak before the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen announced.
Meanwhile, she focuses on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the US would have 48 hours to reach an agreement if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the US.
The US and Mexico agreed in August to revise the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
They are now to be completed by Sunday evening (local time), Trump's government wants to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday to seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily newspaper O Globo.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on the street during an election campaign in southern Brazil at the beginning of September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title “Ele não” (in German: “The Not”), women's associations especially called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, the associations also made racist and misogynistic statements mobile against Bolsonaros.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests intermingled with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As ex-mayor of São Paulo, Haddad has been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The “Trump of Brazil” has been mixing in political operations for a long time, but recently presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be a runoff vote on October 28.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from it - no matter who he compete against.
Bolsonaro is known for rushing against homosexuals and blacks and glorifies the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He repeatedly shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula's Left Workers' Party should be shot.
Europe regains Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale just outside Paris.
The outsider team of Captain Thomas Björn dethroned the favourite defending champion USA for a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators on the three days of Le Golf National.
After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
At the deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year for prostate cancer.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin ', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music stars such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band was dissolved in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album “Midt om natten” is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a “street boy” who was “against everything, but in all hearts”.
The head of government also reminded that the opponent of Monarchy Larsen appeared in 2010 on the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night at the shoe factory: volume at a jackhammer level
“Here we stand, take the bone saw and fire a concert night with the power of a tiger”. The band names of “Here We Stand”, “Tiger Bonesaw” and “The Ignition” alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday night in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure Hardrock by three bands who are friends with each other.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No trace of stage fright.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency “Mosquito” from Oelde - with their bands loudly inspire the around 120 visitors to the “Mint Mosquito” rock night.
Already the quartet “Tiger Bonesaw” with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows to convince at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the concert dances to the harmonious and powerful interaction of the band.
Although “encore” calls cannot be overheard, “Tiger Bonesaw” then leave the stage to the trio “Here We Stand”.
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that Hardrock is not equal to Hardrock.
After the “High Energy Rock” of the “Tigers”, “Here We Stand” also uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only is the yearning, almost ballad-like “Take Me Home” impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet “The Ignition” from Tönnishäuschen has gained a special degree of popularity since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that “The Ignition” has special stage experience with her performances in front of a large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China of 2017 - is obvious and inconspicuous.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also sets their own accents for the only covered song of the evening, “Word Up” by Cameo from the 80s.
In the meantime, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a highly acclaimed solo while running through the audience.
Of course, a certain volume is part of the genre in such a hardrock concert: At the “Mint Mosquito” Rocknacht, according to the mixing console team, the three concerts of “Here We Stand”, “Tiger Bonesaw” and “The Ignition” are about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at a jackhammer level, but is thus still significantly below the controls of the “Wacken Fesitval” point to “The Ignition” on their website.
However, the Ahlen audience does not need at this rock night, deafening 120 decibels in nozzle volume as usual in the annual metal setting in the north of the republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gait have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
“Here we stand, took the bone saw and ignited a concert night with the power of a tiger”, all three groups, of course, can say in the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of visitors.

A dead person in a glider accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
At the airport Mülheim/Essen there was a fatal accident.
A glider crashed in a parking lot at the airport Mülheim/Essen on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near the airport Mülheim/Essen.
According to the “Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung”, a glider crashed in the parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed in the process.
As the “WAZ” continues to report, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is supposed to be a single-seater.
At the time of the accident, the aircraft was already in the approach to landing.
The crash site is located just a short distance from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
The airport Mülheim/Essen is located on the city border of the two Ruhr areas and directly on the driveway to the 52 motorway.
From the car park there is a Park & Ride offer at major events in the Messe Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump rams Kim: “And then we fell in love”
The fact that US President of North Korea's ruler Kim is quite well disposed despite the nuclear crisis is no secret.
But now Trump has made his colleague a true declaration of love.
It also has to do with Kim's “beautiful letters.”
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has known himself to a new flame.
The tragic: it's a long-distance relationship.
In public opinion, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old scion of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although he proves to be quite tough in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
“I was tough, he too, and we went back and forth,” Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay, okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne fruit in political terms: Trump pointed out the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service.
The US president seemed to be aware that the affection for the “Rocket Man”, which is notorious for his martial threatening gesture, - according to Trump's nickname for Kim, should not be appreciated by everyone.
In any case, he anticipated the anticipated criticism of this at his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: “Donald Trump says they fell in love”.
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But don't care for him, Trump explained, and then pointed his index finger to the crowd: “I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidential.”
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this bulging arena, we'd only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Well-visited, atmospheric as well as pampered by sun saturated: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city centre has cleaned up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest took place not only in the marquee at the fire brigade tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees saved from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya using a mobile phone video, enabling them to be saved.
The group had shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under danger of life and disseminated it online.
“They refuse to send us back,” a man said in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website “France 24 Observers”, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flew to Nigeria at the end of August.
“Without the video, we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria,” said Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya trying to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
According to his own statement, he put himself in danger of life with the video.
One of his fellow men was almost beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: “They beat us all with pipes and sticks.”
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their home country this year, said Jorge Galindo, IOM spokesperson in the West African country.
The case of the Nigerians who have now been rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor detention conditions in Libya.
However, he has not heard of a call for help via mobile phone video.
International organisations have long been criticizing the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as unworthy of human beings.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the elementary school place on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building above the main entrance.
In the forehouse of the first floor, she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher contacted the police who started the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot be said yet.

German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to stay in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in Mittelfranken, after he stuck the car away from all the forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and freed the missing person since Tuesday night, the police informed on Sunday.
According to the data, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a trip on his 4x4 across the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search measures, the whereabouts of the man had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) in conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own information, has called for the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries are currently “overshadowed”, said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This concerns above all waves of arrest, freedom of the press and religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, then the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
According to Laschet, he also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan reaffirmed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the owners of the castle refused this against Erdogan out of political conviction.
After the conversation, Erdogan traveled to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: “The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country”.
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump does not tire of emphasizing the successes in the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington's response.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government during the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear weapons free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
“The recent standstill comes from the US building on coercive measures that are fatal to confidence building,” Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
“Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way for us to be the first to disarm ourselves,” said the North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that punishment measures could “force North Korea to its knees” is “a dream of people who do not know us.”
In order to build trust, however, his country had stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasized.
However, there had been no “corresponding reactions” from the US side, the minister criticized.
Last year alone, the UN Security Council decided three sanctions against the internationally isolated country because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been urging the United Nations to adhere to strict sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met North Korea's ruler Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit meeting with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang for talks about the termination of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors to the house of the open house HoT did not get anything from it: white blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the harvest thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank for the food.
The start with the new set-up was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, head of the HoT, recalls.
We had filled our refrigerators before the summer break with food and ingredients and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: a power outage had put the huge two-piece refrigerator out of service, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
“Now we had to start over again: we received a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone,” said Westbuer.
And that's how everyone came along.
The result could be seen, the guests were delighted.
“Chefs can't do better,” a visitor praised impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
“It's really great what the kids and young people have put on their feet,” emphasized Father Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen created amazement with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state executive board NRW of the board
Out of frustration at criticism from his own ranks, Jörg Sartor, head of the Essener Tafel, left his post in the national association.
Sartor had become known throughout Germany because the Essen Tafel had introduced a stop for foreigners.
He resigned as Vice Chief of the North Rhine-Westphalia Tables in July, Sartor told the “World on Sunday”.
Too many have fallen in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy to dpa.
Sartor took the sharp criticism.
“I can understand his step - there were people who didn't know exactly why the Essen Tafel is doing that”.
But Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - “six days a week, nothing changes”, says Weilerswist.
In the “World on Sunday” Sartor again criticized criticism of colleagues from other panels.
One should not take the approach of “without us the people of the city starve”.
It was the task of the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essen did not participate in a congress of the Tables on Friday in Berlin.
“I am told too much sweet treats,” he said.
There are all these social fuzzis who criticized me at the time.
SF Lorch play 2:0 lead - Gmünder daily post
Football, Bezirksliga Lorch loses against newcomers 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after backlog - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clear.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home match against the TV newcomer - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
The TV Heuchlingen was completely different: in Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1, but won with 2:1 after 90 minutes. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to score a 3:0
Gladbach playful two-time lead - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes to the first win of the season against Mainz (1:0).
(sda) Four times in the first five league games, Schalke maneuvered to the offside with early goals.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco once again demonstrated the strength with which it had taken the first place behind the Bavaria last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home quipe in the eleventh minute after strong preparatory work by Yevgeny Konoplyanka, and subsequently the hosts conserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets Dortmund from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had traded a 0 — 2 gap against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came to a 4 — 2 victory in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) compensated with a doublette within four minutes, while Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, ensured with another doublette in the final phase (86/94.) the crowning end of the performance increase after the break.
VfB Stuttgart also came to the first victory.
In the meantime, the Stuttgart people had to fear against Werder Bremen, who had decimated against Milos Veljkovic because of a yellow-red map against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler produced a curious throw own goal that helped the guests to compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a successful but failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher, who joined the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave twice a lead, ultimately playing 2:2 and still waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen and his second Bundesligator were responsible for Wolfsburg's compensation for 1:1.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargau, as did the second goal after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa proves to be a Goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
The French record purchase from the OGC Nice hit Wolfsburg for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the obligatory match.
After seven laps, Gladbach took 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously undefeated Werder Bremen manoeuvred against VfB Stuttgart into an uncomfortable location.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt's team was surprised by a Stuttgart counter-which ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first goal of the season. After 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to win his team: the 23-year-old Serb collected yellow red after a jersey slicker against Daniel Didavi.
Although Stuttgart's defenders Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremen back into the game by a curious one-in-one goal (68.), Gonzalo Castro shot the overnumbered Stuttgarter back on the Siegesstrasse, a quarter of an hour before the end.
Nuremberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens brought the home team on course with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens today vote on whether to change the name of their country in North Macedonia.
A yes could resolve the smoldering conflict with the neighbour Greece for almost three decades.
Athens had insisted on a change of name because of its northern province of the same name and blocked Macedonia's approach to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future integration of the West.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member if the referendum was positive.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat up three pensioners and injured them in part severely.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted on Friday at 10pm in the refuchtgasse in Alsergrund.
When the policemen arrived, they spoke to the accused, who attacked passers-by with clenched fists and tried to attack them.
As a result, the Syrian tried to beat the officials and kick them.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had shortly before hit three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists at a tram stop at Währinger Straße.
He also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussion.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured “for unknown cause,” as it was said by the police.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for everyone, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two said yes in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership was not considered for her, Kahrs had previously told the Bild newspaper.
“If we get married, it's right.” He's been with his partner for 25 years.
55-year-old Kahrs is the spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs raised a stir with an anger speech on 30 June 2017.
Thus he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having “stumbled” on the subject.
“This was your Shabowski moment,” he said, alluding to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the right of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the Citizens' Association Children's House and the Society for Leprosy.
After all, around 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, there was work for about twelve supporters.
“We are doing this to reduce costs,” said the chairman of the civic association Walter Schröer.
And a lot of things have also accumulated.
Due to the hot summer, we're late this time, but fortunately it's just a topiary.
Because already in the spring the hedge had been sheared before.
The breakfast always following the work has also been a long tradition.
“Everyone should keep their strength,” said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the CanusLalom World Cup
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the World Canuslalom Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect race on Sunday on the Olympic circuit.
Two years ago, he missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here on the facility and everything was right today,” said the Olympic third in London 2012.
In the finish, he threw away his paddle with joy and stretched both arms up victoriously - knowing that it would be enough at least for one medal.
After all, he had race number four.
But the six remaining starters couldn't top his fabled time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pawel Eigel.
Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempt to burglary into a family home this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to take advantage of.
Thus, the Gauting police inspectorate reported yesterday the first attempt to burglary this fall.
The fact that it remained at the single-family house on Königswieser Straße is due to the alarm system.
They started when the perpetrators put their hands on Friday just before 8:00 p.m.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system apparently surprised them so much that they flew without prey.
Notes to the PI Gauting, phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
bankruptcy at Hertha: caught up by reality: Bavaria demanded against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: FC Bayern “does not want to let itself fall off” the defeat in Berlin.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance drop under the new coach Niko Kovac should by no means increase to the larger autumn low for Munich.
“A week ago, we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a bit of reality has caught up with us,” said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC, calling for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that's why we're going to accelerate on Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year away no own goal scored, as at the same time the preseason two mandatory matches in series without victory, the standings in the Bundesliga for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as at the final stage of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at the 1:1 with its lucrative mann-ver-man tactics and the Berliners with their playful needle stitches across the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last appearing overpowering Bavaria can be cracked.
“Those who know FC Bayern know that we are not going to like this and we will do everything we can to succeed again,” Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, however, he handled surprisingly gently with his losers in his hometown and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the once again poor handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless leave the first interim conclusion of his term in office to be positive before the international match break - otherwise the tone is likely to get worse.
For example, Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second premier performance of this season after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second pre-round match against Ajax begins as planned, which had also defeated AEK Athens by 3:0.
“Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also score our goals again,” announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
Like after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke in particular.
The right-hand defender appeared in the role of a mahner.
“I don't think that's all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes behind,” stressed the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh matchday of the previous season, the Bavarians were already behind Dortmund with five points, which now took the lead again with one point advantage.
And so, with a wink, Kimmich valued at least positively that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
“Yes, that's good,” said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack from Erdogan to Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in the permanent dispute topic Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President of the Republic strongly criticised the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the head of the DFB defended the association line.
In the early Sunday morning, the Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the cause at the ZDF “Sportstudio” in Mainz.
“We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many immigrant players in the U-Teams - that something like this does not happen again,” said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not represent the values of football and the DFB.
He had strongly denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they had taken pictures with me in England,” Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
Honestly, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt “reasonably treated by the DFB after the World Cup affair, which had started with photos of the two with Erdogan.”
At the same time, he announced that he would like to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I am German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that cannot be done.
“I very much regret that he has such an impression,” said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a consequence, a Brazilian native Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, will now be appointed an additional Commissioner for Integration.
“If someone without an immigrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says, “The issue is important, we have to take care of it,” that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our clubs where integration needs to work,” said Grindel.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he plans to run for the post of DFB president again next year.
“I do my job and try to do it as good as it can,” Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10am and 1pm.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he was driving against her car.
However, there was no exchange of personals, as the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot anymore.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a motorist who would have escaped from the road and driven against a guide post.
Reached to this, the man did not want police on the spot and then drove away.
Then the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
After all, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car had significant damage to accidents.
The 75-year-old made a confusing impression and could not remember much.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 emergency forces are still in action.
Around four weeks after the eruption of the moorfire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 emergency forces are still engaged in the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
According to a spokesman, the situation continues to develop steadily, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of emergency forces is planned, says.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which was declared on 21 September a week earlier, because it had been feared that the flames caused by wind and sparks would endanger adjacent forests and settlements.
On Thursday, it was said that a fire spread to neighboring communities would no longer threaten.
At times, more than 1500 emergency forces attempted to get the fire under control.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehrtest site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
According to the German Armed Forces, reconnaissance flights with “tornados” are also planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire was triggered by test rakets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the moorfire had at times moved up to a hundred kilometers far over the north-west of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr intends to set up a contact point to receive claims.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
These two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two said yes in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership was not considered for her, Kahrs had previously told the Bild newspaper.
If we get married, it's right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
55-year-old Kahrs is the spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs raised a stir with an anger speech on 30 June 2017.
Thus he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having “stumbled” on the subject.
“This was your Shabowski moment,” he said, alluding to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the right of adoption.
Referendum started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the highly anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Approximately 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province of the same name the neighbor Greece.
For almost three decades, Athens had blocked Skopje's approach to the EU and NATO as a means of leverage.
If citizens vote yes, they will also give the starting signal for their country's West Integration.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from oblivion

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is designed to facilitate organ donations and relieve the burden of relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that institutions may continue to be withdrawn only with explicit consent, emphasises Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden of relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that institutions may continue to be withdrawn - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, emphasises Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss have a donor card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases a card is found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the talks, relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
“You then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome,” says Always.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information about possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as Marita Völker-Albert, spokeswoman for the Federal Agency for Health Education, says.
“There is no register in which people can register their desires - per or contraindicated organ donation,” she says.
Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn has advocated a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or her relatives contradict.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old pupil is world champion in mental arithry
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in the mental race.
He prevailed against 39 combatants at Wolfsburg on the weekend.
This was announced on Sunday by Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74 year old French pensioner, as chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organises the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example, 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants competed against guests from the audience using a calculator.
Wenzel Greetings from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was there two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or prodigy, organizer Laue can hardly start.
“Mechaping can be trained,” he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even computational competitions in stadiums.
Among the disciplines, for example, square rooting from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, the candidates get surprising tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans would have good chances here, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage, because they learn more intensively and with other effective methods from early childhood.
Urgent appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about early breast cancer detection
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows itself from her emotional and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer with this video and stand up for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song “I Touch Myself” from the group “The Divinyls” - only her hands conceal her most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which focuses on early breast cancer detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams would have died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia, there were complications.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send an appropriate bill on the so-called “Symbols Act” in review.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow on the mountains in the west
Mrs Holle is shaking out her beds next week in the West for the first time: polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it could snow down to about 1,000 meters at high intensity.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern mountains, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher-lying pass roads (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner High Alpine Road), the road conditions therefore become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual kink care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start the annual kink care on Monday.
The unique “green ramparts” in Germany have been shaping the landscape of the low-forested state for around 200 years.
The tree and shrub hedges up to five meters wide are “forest substitutes” and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect habitats scattered as corridors, through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as Ingo Ludwichowski, Managing Director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of an order of the Dänenking Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The “living fences” were not only field boundary and cattle fence, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name “Kink” comes from that time: Through the “kinking” of the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, around 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North and Baltic Sea and lend the image of a woody, richly structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a substitute habitat by around 7000 animal species.
In one kilometre, up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the kink can only perform its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, he atrophies to a light row of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, also lost the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, kink care may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
According tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesier talks about situation on site
In an interview with the editorial network Deutschland (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi following the earthquakes and tsunami:
Were you on site during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java at that time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport on Palu was closed at that time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of “World Vision” has also been destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills, on which they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are staying in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and petrol stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
Also a prison was destroyed, the prisoners sometimes run around freely, and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information supply going on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before that it did not work and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people who they do not know if they live and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but, for example, at work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the clear came, many thought “okay, not a tsunami” - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was a misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Isn't an island like Sulawesi located on the Pacific Ring of Fire prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to do without Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo had a muscle fiber tear in the back left thigh in the 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesligist announced on Sunday.
At Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle rupture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss matches even after the following country break.
VfB Stuttgart did not provide a forecast for downtime.
A muscle bundle rupture usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fibrous rupture usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the Film Festival of San Sebastián annually closes the ranches of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the songs on the cinema, we can summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.

On Sunday morning, the fire brigade Olching tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action retreated for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - walkers on Lake Olchinger noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the water station area.
To help the animal, passers-by called the police and the fire brigade.
However, the first attempts to catch the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the emergency forces again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade could circle the animal and push it back ashore, where after almost an hour it was put into a transport crate by a firefighter with a hearty handle.
The duck injured on the breast was then taken to the veterinary clinic of the LMU in Oberschleißheim.
But, according to the initial estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard wins the World Cup medal
Fourth place at the Olympics, biathlete Julian Eberhard was in his stomach for a long time.
Next winter, the Saalfeldener wants to make up for the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the close medal.
Seven tenths of a second was missing on bronze.
“I deliberately took time to process this,” says Eberhard at the opening of the myGym gym in his hometown Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the missed precious metal in the new season: “The goal can only be to get back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point, you'll have to strike.
The World Cup track in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: “I have already closed the track to the heart”, he recalls with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria last winter in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
He finished second with the season in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbo speed
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is severely limited.
With an FBI inquiry at turbospeed, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the extremely thin majority for the judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, controversial for allegations of coercion.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents that occurred more than 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama about Kavanaugh's vocation accompanied by a cultural struggle was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer issued angry tirades against the opposition democrats, the Senate's Justice Committee was to clear the way for the final confirmation of the archconservative judge at the US Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but would require an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had called the heavy talks on Thursday as “crap”, initially abstained further attacks against the women and, on the contrary, spoke of “happiness in misfortune”.
That way, last doubts could be dispensed, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply at an election rally because they reject Kavanaugh: “They try to block and destroy”.
Trump orders FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
One would specifically investigate the known accusations of two women, that's all that, a government representative told the Wall Street Journal: “They're not going on a fishing trip.”
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar device installed in a “civil vehicle” of the municipality of Ried for monitoring the speed limit is stationed on the Gartenstraße from Monday, October 1.
The Federal School Centre is also located there.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: Feeling the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the factor time played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime, it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football matches.
That was no different in the home match against Mainz 05.
“I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and lots of balls in our penalty area,” said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the Königsblaue had succeeded in bringing the scarce 1:0 against the Rhine Hesse over time and thus the first victory of the season under the roof.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the leadership of Alessandro Schöpf 11 gave certainty to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco: “In total, the first half was good, both playful and pressing,” apparently more and more the head played a role with increasing playing time.
Don't actually get a Header Beast
“The last ten minutes have felt like two hours to me,” Heidel said: “If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that”.
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore they kept withdrawing.
And defended against Mainz with man and mouse.
To save the first three counters of the season.
“We all fell a huge stone from our hearts,” said Schöpf, who had no insignificant contribution to this with his header hit: “I am actually the worst headball player in the team”.
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
“We wanted to start in the early stages and make fireworks out of it,” said Schalke's chief coach.
Victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, quietly and courageously, so we have to play games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest drawback of the afternoon: Royal Blue missed worrying about clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the bar 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
“Then it would not have been a trembling victory,” said Tedesco: “You have already felt the fear a bit”.
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not overlooked.
From a distance of about two kilometres, a hiker in the Leitzach Valley observed a fire at 1.30 on Sunday.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The reason for the police and fire brigade soon found out: An unknown man had lit garbage on a two-square-metre area at the Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it seemed that he had monitored the fire for a long time, but then left the embers unattended.
And this is near the forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were engaged in pulling out and extinguishing.
The police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on an equal footing
In front of them stands the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly responded to the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
“I have made it my job to bring interesting people to Greven for many years,” explains the founder and chairman of the “Reckenfelder Treffs” - the association that cooperates with the alliance “Cultural Policy” in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani very easily enters the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject understandably.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and one or another joke, he brings listeners closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts increasingly emerging despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at one table, the first generation migrants at Katzentisch.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to take part in the deciding process.
That would lead to conflicts.
The decisive factor is therefore not whether one is politically placed on the right or left, but: “Am I for or against an open society?” , he emphasizes.
Initially behave rather at first, then the discussion board starts more and more lively.
And there is a need to speak.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or insuccessful integration with students.
El-Mafaalani stands before, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is on equal footing.
The sociology professor does not urge his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because “only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions,” says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing session, he still has an open ear for the questions of the guests and was also intensively discussed in the foyer during prepared Kurdish specialities.
Basketball: Bonn and Giessen win kick-off games

At the beginning of the new season, German champion Bayern Munich and former serial champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich already struggled to an 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80 on Saturday.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is apparently huge: more than 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening sold the first plots of land in the new development area Landsham-South on the free market.
This is what Mayor Roland Frick tells you.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots offered by the municipality at more favourable terms and prices - similar to the previous local model.
A good 100 applications have been received, says Frick.
“Currently the documents are being reviewed”, with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Plieningen, the goal is to have created the applicants ranking for the 20 plots by the end of the year and submit them to the municipal council.
Subsequently, the award could take place.
A total of 50 plots for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the area in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-family houses with expected eight residential units each.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and paths are to be paved soon.
A single plot as well as two of the apartment buildings belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the bulk on the free market, 20 plots of land in a socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two apartment buildings of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented dwellings funded by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated living space for about 200 people is created on the area of the new building area Landsham-Süd.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start of the new construction of a daycare center is taking place there.
It will accommodate three kindergartens and three crib groups as well as a multipurpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, with the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalke's Naldo “big sport” also succeeds on the bench
For the third time in a row, Naldo would like to thank Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had been sitting on the exchange bench for the third time in a row, not in the Schalker starting elf but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great among many people if the almost two-metre Brazilian had once really talked the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1-0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 as usual and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco to all his pros, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo for simplicity, turned in and said, “We have to thank you, coaches!”
“That was very emotional, that was great sport,” later Tedesco said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reservist existence, had no resentment.
Probablích knows Naldo, who was celebrated last season as best Schalker, that he did not really get on the siding with his coach - but is given a break for good reasons.
A reason called “load control”.
It wasn't easy to tell him that
“It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you quite honestly,” Tedesco told him about the moment he told Naldo he wasn't on the starting eleven.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club ", Tedesco explained the step.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can take a breath right now.
And that we all keep in the boat,” explained Tedesco the rotation that recently caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself an exemplary team player on the bench.
The sentiment in Austria's industry continued to accelerate its downward downward pace compared to the eurozone in August.
The PMI was 46.7 points at a 37-month low.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third best mood in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute reported on Monday among 3,000 companies in its survey.
Unlike in Austria, the Eurozone PMI rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still below the 50 counter mark for the 13th consecutive month, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry hit this threshold with 50.9 points in August.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the sentiment barometer declined, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March at 44.0 points.
“The slightly slowed down downhill could mean that the worst has survived,” said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry - in any case in the third quarter - remains the number one growth brake.
A quick return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone have not fallen as much as since November 2011.
The companies therefore dismantled jobs for the seventh consecutive month.
In China, too, industrial production fell more strongly in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The PMI is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in turnover, employment, warehouses and prices are collected.
Tuchel's PSG team achieves eighth win in the eighth league match
September 29, 2018 at 7:45pm
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel rushes further from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won 3:0 (1:0) thanks to two matches from Superstar Neymar and was thus also successful in the eighth league match.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season 82 years ago in France.
The Brazilian Neymar took PSG in the lead after 22 minutes and made the final score in the afterplay time.
Christopher Nkunku (46.) took care of the interim 2:0.
In this way, Paris also succeeded in the dress rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
To kick off the premier class, Tuchel's team had defeated the only obligatory defeat of this season at the 2:3 Liverpool.
