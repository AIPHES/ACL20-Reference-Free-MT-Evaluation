Freedom of the press: federal government defends the journalist's throw-out
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellor's office, the Turkish Journalist living in Hamburg had worn over a T-Shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "freedom for journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-Shirt, had not been the Problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a question of disrupting the process of the press conference.
The journalist's action had caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
It was because of this that he caused the man to be taken out by the guards.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities, or support for, or membership in banned parties, or of the Fethullah-Gülen-movement.
The Turkish leadership is making the move for the failed coup attempt on May 15. July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades of imprisonment.
Even foreign journalists are not sure about the Turkish authorities: only at the beginning of September was the Austrian Journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
Although they were free and able to return to Germany, there are still trials in Turkey against the two.

There you have to look twice: yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg-and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - NDR-produced talk show "Inas Nacht" is for boozy conversations at the counter of the port of Hamburg pub "haddock post".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests on some beer, some wine or even more intense drinks to loosen the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities drink up courage for the compulsory singing.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: the actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "men's hearts"," Terror - her verdict "or"the hottest day".
However, the trip to the Far North did not get to Munich well.
On Saturday he posted a Selfie-his face is completely chewed on it, the eyes only two small slits.
The bed Selfie shows a totally exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he only has a mighty hangover.
To his Fans and directed, he posted some - probably not very serious - insight that he has gained: "rule one: NEVER go to Inas night.
Rule two: never drink the black Sow.
And Spritz.
And the round of eggnog, throw Ina at half past three, way let.
The 43-year-old is truly in the face of alcohol consumption.

Treysa has to fight with vandalism and treason
The entry in the 36-km-long Rail bike path in little red riding hood country in Treysa presents itself hard to find and littered.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly noticeable.
Shards, cigarette tippers, garbage and debris, demolished rubbish bins and now dismantled signposts - for a long time now the entrance with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße Hill in Treysa has been presented.
For the showcase object railway cycle path in the red Capricorn a more than an indecent sight.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC-local group Schwalmstadt but also others for some time, according to the cycling commissioner of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the cycling advisory board.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals ranged from the laying of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been included in the local advisory board.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and local residents - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often noisy, at the jails is also destroyed: posts torn out of the Earth, rubbish bins demolished, signs bent over, seating furniture smeared.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
You are annoyed that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting place for scooters.
"Along the entire cycle path, there is a clear focus on the Haaße Hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it becomes really expensive".
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "perhaps this sets the threshold significantly higher, to tire out of common good.
However, this would require a police patrol to come by in a timely manner.
Basically, wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße-hill.
It had to be made more attractive.
With the traffic of the bike path so far, one could be very pleased.
Tourism marketing is still possible.
Our bike path is very high quality in comparison to others in Germany," says the ADFC members.
As a extremely critical danger point ADFC estimates-member Susanne a Klippert, the Situation in the ash-röder Straße in Treysa.
There is no sign of a turn on the Haaße Hill.
In the event of heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between the two-way flow," she explains.
This is not a Problem for sporty drivers, but for older drivers and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Kulturbahnhof: the "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creatively and with each other.
"D perform a song for Hiltrup," reads the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A Contest "with wink in the likeable Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family together with coffee and cake from the Volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations A were, of the man Band to a large Ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf An, a long time in Hiltrup of Albachtener, the Nine of the "Hiltruper star colors", three members and three generations of families Trenkamp and Claus, an Ensemble from the Kindergarten Lummer country and, finally, Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.live
This Contest, said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not seen this in other districts.
What did the copywriters see as connected?
The Hiltruper Lake and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned in the places.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup"in his beat-like song.
The Cultural Centre was also appreciated.
Again and again it was about the experience of each other in these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with Short Interviews with the artist, or draw attention to their work.
Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
A sound engineer Stefan schemmel man Franke knew to report that occurred recently in Ludwigshafen - on a large event in the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has placed a lot on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favorites of the Jury there was still something special-so that others can hear their Songs.
A whole CD can play back the Alvin Jasic and his Pianist Marcel Untied with a sound engineer schemmel man.
Other musicians can record a song: An with his Hiltrup-Schlager, the impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummer-country-pride": "a very beautiful appearance" with ten kids and two teachers on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children performed at the Finale once again - and sounded "really good" even without electronic support, as Franke said.
The Jury was guided by the aspects of originality, relation to Hiltrup, catchy melody and recognition value.
The Jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfass of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district Offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its 10th anniversary.
She valued the Event as a full success.
All were "very satisfied", and" the atmosphere was good " in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two Teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, four cards with key words, one can decipher the old Trick with the red foil, if you put into it.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read by mistake.
For example, the cards read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Cube.
4. ".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
After all, Codes are not to be guessed here.
Alternately, one player per Team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card, on which, perhaps, "3.4.2". steht.
In "Decrypto", the terms behind the secret foil should not be guessed, but rather their encryption codes.
Its task in this case: He is to describe - in this order, and in this example, the terms "cube", "Solid" and "window" - so that his own Team can recognize the correct order, and the enemy Team as possible; because that wins the game, when he twice manages to crack the Code.
So, the encryptor writes down and reads aloud: "throw" for the dice, " loose "as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like" Party "would be possible and" Prague " because he took care of the school and knows the local window fall.
This is round by round, Team by Team.
Although you do not know the terms of the other side - but this can with any hint, which the encryptor gives there, better converge.
As mysterious as possible, but not too twisted should be the transcripts, otherwise it makes it unnecessarily difficult for his Team.
The most cryptic about "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it for quite a while until they can finally play.
The explanatory video below decrypto.info it makes it easier on the net.
But once you've started, you'll be fascinated by how much feeling this inconspicuous game has.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessor and Genre Primus "Codenames", which is also an agent theme on a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if it's just about guessing and not about Victory Points, you can easily find a Version for two.
Kulmbach: man shows police Hitler greeting and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-Year-old man, the police Kulmbach employees in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
It was in the upper town of a passing police patrol that he showed the Hitler salute, later he also noticed in the upper town in a pub, as he harassed other guests.

Station of Pressig was home to the Schubloks
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers banged up on buffers, they heard it quite Pressig," recalls Georg spelt, who archives the history of the place and the railway station.
That didn't excite anyone.
The brakes also squeaked and rattled the wagons.
Was that railway pur.
Statements that symbolically represent Dinkel's Homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramps-mountain route to the North, which has its peak in Steinbach am Wald after an increase of about 220 meters of altitude.
In order to cope with this situation, trains and shackles were used in the past, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive shed, Apprentice workshop, overhead line and railway master's workshop.
"The heart was the hub, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional ice-making.
The railway plant (BW) Pressig, which was placed under Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On 15. On July 11, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported on a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimised the need for train and thrust locomotives.
From 1977 they were only needed for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 weighings were allocated per month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were demolished, and in 1991 the remainder were demolished.
Heidrich: "it is regrettable that we have not envisaged a better use of the site, also in terms of freight transport".
At Pentecost in 1989, the Nuremberg railway Directorate celebrated the 50th anniversary of the electrification of Nuremberg-Saalfeld.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later that out.
On 1. On June 30, 1991, the last 30 men were removed, the shunting station was Pressig history.
"The shunter and brake Leger completed the most difficult Work in the operation of trains," recalls spelt.
Each error would have had fatal consequences.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the" Dream ship " Heide Keller became a Star.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series might have had a complicity in her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on 01.On January 22, 2018, she left for ever.
The series, which made her a Star, could be co - responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929-2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world and many of my colleagues admired me on an equal footing," says Keller in conversation with the "Bild am Sonntag".
At first she was only "Hans von Borsody's wife", but that changed with the "Dream ship".
For now the journalists only called at Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so well."
She considers it possible that her husband at the time might have been envious, but "like many men, Hans spared talks about problems and feelings".
Keller always tried for Hans von Borsody " to be the only right and he did not want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
This means in good German: I have adjusted myself", as she explains.
She had always felt " not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, which I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared naughty and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it could also go wrong a second time".
The day before the civil marriage, I sat crying in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had the love then "as imagined in the Film.
Unfortunately, this Vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I went too naively towards love".
The night-time fan, who regularly explores the city's nightlife at the NZZ resort in Zurich, has this time ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our moth is not a moth, but it's a little lightsaber.
And the flash of shine, in which a green carpet is dipped on the six-skin square, dazzles him over charge.
But it's just Film Festival, because more or less famous want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So he torches this late Thursday evening over the square, to facilitate himself in the" Aquaclean-WC-Oase " briefly.
The of a large plumbing company-sponsored public toilet facility that celebrates the Festival Premiere is called: The urinal in the ground floor of a new pavilion, there is a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks in the men's oasis for some reason to the sky.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who have just entertained at the cinema next door the opening film "Green Book" at the best level, celebrate like every year the beginning of the festival with a Party in the three-storey department store.
Its Name fits perfectly with this film festival: it is known that the works on display date from the whole globe .
What you don't have to come up with in an article about this Festival, so as not to fall into creep advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The moth is tied up by a knuckle around the sensor, which has infected him a good fairy, and two bully bouncy bouncers actually wave him in.
Inside, the invited, they dance far after midnight to Live music or can be dictated by DJ rhythms, to which they yell at each other, and rinse with Cüpli exquisite appetizers down.
In the delicatessen shop in the Souterrain, oysters wait for mouth-watering mouths, next door the incomparable raw Ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain gushes.
And the Hammer is: All the shelves of exclusive products have not been cleared up for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The Moth studied the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
Should this be two separate instructions, he got lost in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it certainly has saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the winged man tilts a Cocktail prepared with Espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the Festival Award.
This Mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the price for the best Drink.
And George Clooney, who's been promoting this brand for years, isn't here that night either.
But there is a face that is known to the Observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main character may not be far.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks right through the crowd, almost like a choir boy, with almost sixty.
He won't be fooled, he won't be fooled, at most, he couldn't be fooled.
International Stars love this film festival, especially for this restraint, which is often misunderstood as being jammed.

Bieletzki usually takes care not to blame others.

LIT had a good laugh and met up to the end four times-while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The guys fought great, stood good at the back even against seven men and threw again and again on the empty goal.
Only you can buy for the compliments little.

There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch with his hard went to court.
He was the Coach of the football District league VfL Wolbeck, who retired (internally) to think about the lack of motivation on the green.
All History.
In the meantime, it is up and running again around the Brandhoveweg.

After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came for him - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly over into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited for balls in front.
Wolbeck had significantly more play in the first section.
And Opportunities.
But Frerichs before his from (17.), the substitute Luca Rehberg (26.) and Jan Schroer (38.) missed the lead.
This would almost have been avenged, when the SCA in Minute 41 twice in the Person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously hit the Wolbecker box-Tormann Damian Hallas turned out to be the champion of his profession.

As the old Rhine, Chris Naber bäumer in the 70. Minute Robin Westhues issued, there have been 18 meters in front of the guest housing is an indirect free kick for the home team.
The cultured himself came up and demonstrated his dangerousness with Standards.
Westhues " thing with the right flabbergasted down left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th minute. In the second half the leather in the box unlucky to the Hand.
The strike was blocked by a Hamm referee Hüseyin Sahin.
Jannis Schneider could not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase for a long time before Geske were able to finish in the 87th minute. In the second half of the 20th Minute from twelve meters still had the winning goal on the Pusche.
Maybe it would have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas-N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer-Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann-Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Gesske) - Thewes

Report of The Allbright Foundation: women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 per cent of the members of the management board were members of the supervisory board as of the reporting date 1. The report "the power of monoculture", which will be officially presented this Monday by The Allbright Foundation and submitted to the German Press Agency in advance, was published on 30 September.
"The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will move past them," said Foundation managing director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, Great Britain and Sweden, purely male management teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
By comparison, the backlog made German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German Stock Exchange Companies is also due solely to positive impulses among companies in the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright figures, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure had still stood at 3.8 percent.
The share of women among the 30 Dax companies-a pioneer in recent years - has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will again recruit more consistent women in the coming year-in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that they would not make a commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
A different picture can be seen on the supervisory boards: as of January 1, 2012, the supervisory board had a Voting Rights. At the end of September, the proportion of women was 30.5 per cent - 45 more women and 68 less men than a year ago.
"If you recruited just as many women per year for the management board, a 40 percent share would have been reached in 2023," the report says.

Manchester United lost in the 7th round of the Ligacup after being blameless. Round of the Premier League.

The scene was emblematic in the 74th century. Marko Arnautovic for West Ham scored 3:1, only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As Mark Nobel's Pass was suspected to be an Offside, all Manchester defence players were stopped, and Arnautovic all the time allowed the Ball to pass the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of a previously long-term poor performance.

After the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
At first, the London side eliminated Jürgen Klopp's Team in the Cup, and by the draw in the league the Blues Liverpool fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) 2:0-victories celebrated.

VW's core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show in the wake of the Diesel debate
The Paris automobile salon is held every two years alternating with the Frankfurt motor show.
Paris-officially not a topic and yet ubiquitous: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting should not let the German car companies release even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 motor show, you will be showing your new products from next week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The Diesel does not really play a major role in this.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for Diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, but still should be an important issue at least behind the brilliant backdrop of the exhibition stands.
A big Name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen group with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core VW brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there, and have, among other things, its first pure electric models, The e-tron, the Ingolstadt-based company is expected by the end of the year, the EQC Stuttgart in 2019.
But both were officially presented.
The iNext of BMW will not start until 2021.
The focus in Paris is the new 3 Series.
In total, this year, from 4. until 14. More than 250 exhibitors will be present at the event on October 10.
In addition to car drivers, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The Fair, which this year will celebrate its 120th anniversary.Every two years, the IAA takes place in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were a good one Million visitors.
At least 380 people died during the severe earthquakes and the following Tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken on Friday by two earthquakes.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second is the magnitude of 7.4.
Communication and transport connections have been damaged, causing enormous damage to property.
After the quake, the Tsunami struck the West coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims will increase significantly.
The figures so far only come from Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected-along Sulawesi's West Coast.

First of all, the Biker-Frühschoppen was on the program and it could be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty Currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo Team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach goods.
The sermon was preached during the service of the Biker pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical background.
"Although bikers prefer Blues Rock, Valerie Lill is more poetic and quiet," said Pastor Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates great celebration: after the Apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his Apple press in his luggage and demonstrated step-by-step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big Hopper.
With a little muscle strength, a finely crushed mass was extracted from the apples.
Not many of the children were able to imagine how it would become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step in this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and enveloped by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which look a little like chippings, on top of each other.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice into a large vessel.
However, the Software farmer had already finished bottled specialities.
So he opened his "treasure chest"and presented the older visitors with the latest spring White.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children could not only pursue the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Also Active the Software comradeship of former soldiers committed in the framework of the Festival and invited some of the stations to entertaining Play.
In the coming year, the home club will also offer a day of action.
Then, however, according to Gregor Krützkamp, the Home House in the heart of the savings village will not be the place of action.

1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season-broke: "shitty Situation"
Frankfurt / Main after the fourth Bundesliga defeat in succession, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around and gave them courage.
However, there was a lot of positive results in the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a fucking Situation, but you have to get out as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after:"this is of course disappointing, because you always take a lot of action".
The continued victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslim (86.) in their current state of affairs, they are a descent candidate.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated its first home win in the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36. Minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) in front of 46,300 spectators, they scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio, moved into the midfield with seven points.
Croatia's Vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse region during his debut.
After the World Cup, the long-awaited striker showed with his pace and assertiveness, why he is so valuable for the match.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, borrowed from Liverpool, was the first time in the opening formation of the frankfurters, which began to swing.
Lucas Torró (17) is penalised after committing a foul. brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising Position at the last Moment by the 96-defense of Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back), who had failed in the short term.
The leadership for the House Lords fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the Ball after a defensive corner in the penalty area, Haller extended his head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the French second-division AJ Auxerre defence player in the summer.
And Frankfurt was down ahead of the break.
This time, Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who skilfully got through and 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser left no Chance.
In the mid-term, Hannover Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak performance of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxony played a little bolder forward, but igniting ideas remained until just before the end, when at least the final goal was achieved.
The Hessen was much more efficient.
After an hour or so, Rebic started a Solo and then laid across De Guzmán, who just had to push the Ball into the empty goal.
The Rest was for the Frankfurter against overcharged guests only to watch, also Jovic hit a Minute before the end still.
The Morlaix court is to the party mile

Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy cross-Feast
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the feast of the Holy Cross on the 14th of June. September or on Sunday after.
The festival Service takes place in the town church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the closing blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross is home to Christ, who was killed in the 30-year war and who, according to legend, was shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood flowed out of the wound.
From this, a great pilgrimage to the bullet Christ developed, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished until today, only the altar room stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Pastor Adolf Buhl recalls that the Cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
In spite of the importance of the Geisinger Parish, worship was poorly attended.
After the worship the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the closing blessing the church part of the cross festival ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting to the Catholic parish hall for the secular part of the festival.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty meals, as well as a wide selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm holidays.
In the afternoon, the parish still offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual calls for proposals were prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become larger, but it has also been determined more, which was only possible by the Inaugenscheinnahme using scaffolding.
The plastering of the base has been completed, the natural stone works are to be started before the Winter and it is hoped that a good half of these works will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residential home in the New Ulm Cathedral view road
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opened in münster view road is a new residential home for people with disabilities.
In the Munster view street now, "a very special house," his destiny is passed - as all present at the inauguration date agreed.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair users, who have been living in the dorm of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time, depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was put on the test bench for the residents with Handycap: "the House had come into the years and no longer contemporary in the equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators approached to demolish the House.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the residents can feel at home in it, according to the architect.
Life Aid Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
The Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework-both in terms of time and money.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The gap between barrier-free and fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements, which allows the residents to experience the freedom to move without help from abroad.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the Social Administration of the district of Schwaben, said the same: "the house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants, who need tools to be mobile."
The homeliness and functionality had been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "the plot in this situation is a real lucky case, because it is so in today's Situation no longer to acquire".
Overall, the new residential home in the Munster view road on nearly 1,500 square meters, can accommodate 30 people with a disability, divided into three residential groups.
Heinz, managing director of Lebenshilfe, is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed by tariff.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - before the day of unity, deputy SPD federal president Manuela Schwesig appealed to all countrymen not to accept the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences after almost 30 years of unit pain.
We must not be content with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the "Daily Mirror on Sunday".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans on average worked longer than the people in West Germany, but they would receive a 15 percent lower salary.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German Unification," said Schwesig.
North Korea: does this clean dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an Effort to a relaxation of relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has made the South Korean President, Moon Jae-In, two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs as a gift.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, about a year old, reached their recipients on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food, to the animals to facilitate the "familiarization".
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced its friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to participate in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket engines.
Austria's eventful history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published, which answer this question mostly in retrospect over the past hundred years.
In a completely different way, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director-General of the Austrian State Archive, writes about it in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which was first published on 1 January 2012. Will be released on October 14th.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to factual work - this is the unofficial Motto for the grand coalition's work week, which is beginning today.
Hardly an Interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have summoned mantra-like the "return to factual work".
This may have led some artisans, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the justified question of what is actually the difference between work and physical work, but let it be so.
If the federal government is now ready to devote itself again to its mission - to govern-it should not be discouraged from it now with conceptual debates.
If Union and SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and Blamages of the last few weeks, the Monday may already show.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet to form the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round on a regular basis in order to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, the Diesel retrofits and the immigration of skilled workers Act are once again on the agenda for conflict-prone issues.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get away with exchange bonuses smirkly, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technical retrofitting of older Diesel.
While the diesel crisis has seen a rapprochement over the weekend, the Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned immigration of skilled workers act.
The SPD calls for a perspective of stay for rejected asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strictly opposed to the 'change of lanes' from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will again be quarrels among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
It was not the same and the same time that GroKo came together, but three partners with very different social patterns and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not advance.
In order to be constructive, however, dispute must not be overturned again on the question of whether or not to be a party.
It's still about politics, not Theatre.
The Union and the SPD should fight-but always keep an eye on the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful to many?
This key question allows both the Diesel and the lane change question to be resolved pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
That is why the people's parties must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hardinger
Minister in sight
Does the minister of labour, of all people, violate the current service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" had their Legists worked on the Social Security Reform, reported a exuberant social Minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger is surprised by the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via request.
She believes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the use of her team and not to declare any violations of current service law in front of cameras".
However, she now has questions in order to be able to release Hartinger "from any suspicion".
Police are tearing up a street in search of women
Marxgrün-for a long time, the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning is dug on the State Road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The track is closed in the area of Marx green until Monday.
It was preceded by the fact that the investigators had previously used an archeological dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with his guide, was able to finally narrow the relevant area to a few meters in repeated use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Supreme Bavarian Conservation Authority in the area of the said piece of road.
For more than a year, the prosecutor's office and criminal police court process the missing case.
In the wake of the new construction of the State Road 30 years ago, Heike's body could have been buried here.
Color powder and eggs: Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia-anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum is taking place in Catalonia for the first time.
But before that, there are riots.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona-just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 January 2009 On October 10, 2017, the separatists and the police collided in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates, among other things, with color powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a Demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3000 police officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honour their colleagues in the polling stations last year in the referendum, which was classified as illegal.
The attempt to prevent citizens from voting was also violent at that time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the Central government security forces separated, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the approximately 6,000 separatists would then have tried to break through the police chain with force, and the officials, among other things, threw with color bags and eggs.
Six people were arrested, 24 others were slightly injured, according to the authorities.
On Monday, the independence referendum is coming for the first time.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region from Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont exiled to Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatists movement, on the other hand, continue to be in U-custody.
In December, new elections had been held in the Region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the compulsory administration was terminated.
But also the new regional President Quim Torra is on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen are separated by torlos
Rot-Weiß Ahlen occurs more on the spot.
FC Gütersloh also had a 0-0 draw.
The closing light and the third last turned out to be in front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as a gathered perplexity.
The first half was manageable by the entertainment factor arg.
For this reason, anyone who wanted to get a beer or a Bratwurst could do so without any worries.
There was no danger of missing a goal chance, because there was practically no.
The first shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire match, Güterslohs Nick Flock drew in the 28. In the second half of the year.
The best - and only real - way to the Ahlener, as Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic West Gerling forced after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area limit to a Parade.
The hosts were even more harmless.
The most effective action consisted in an early exchange.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him, Sinan Aygün came.
After the change both Teams decided to do something against the increasingly coming boredom.
In the 48. After an hour, the Gütersloher also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball capture by Matthäus Wieckowicz it went fix.
The quickly put forward counter-Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) but with the flaps a shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they put with a header but the ball is Wieckowicz (66.) from a corner of the Ex-Ahleners Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, initially Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and, a little later, Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It did-nothing.
The Ahlener did not achieve more than visual superiority thanks to its own Initiative.
Only in the 91. In the second half Cihan Yilmaz had the last Chance, but they also didn't bring in anything.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the Positive: "I like the fact that we played to zero". But unfortunately, the Zero also stood at the front.
"This time, we were not as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede, and although our opponent did not want to play here," RW Ahlens stated.
Offensively, "everything splashed so a bit" against a Team, " which just wanted to defend.
At least I didn't feel we could get a goal," Daut said.
As a spectator, however, one did not feel like his Team could score.
The idea was too poor for that.
Stretching fields harvest market: fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
The Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler of the stretching fields Board is pleased to issue, for these donations.
The volunteers assure:"these donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening the sky was bright blue, but the place was still a little empty, but that should change during the day.
Because: "here it is so nice sociable, that's why we are here today," said a visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl Outfit as always with a nice touch of Humor.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) got sick.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "substitute" could not take it, in between Musically to entertain the increasing number of visitors.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at a later hour.
"Just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is happy about the many active with their stalls, including mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should not be anything like a blackboard," he nevertheless thanked himself for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of all who were in action at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden city is a colourful painting-here's something.
Then the Maikranz was removed by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarters.
Many stalls were worked for the physical well-being.
From Sweet to savory everything was.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who lives since a year in reckenfeld, was at his scroll saw creative.
He offered veneer work, beer lids with rectangular fields motifs and a lot more.
A specialty offered three stretching fields of beekeepers: "- stretching fields of honey", brought by the Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Bush schlüter.
But the latter has a specialty.
Honey cake in glass, naturally with honey from my own production.
Since the little Elsa had to access again and again, so well tasted the cake.
It is the sociability that allowed the visitors to stay long until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the Autumn Festival.
Smudges with local political message: no successful advertising for skateboard
In Lengerich, unknown persons have probably hardly promoted the construction of a skate facility.
In several places there are corresponding greases, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been prosecuted for damage to property.
In large letters on signs, among other things, the three words " skate park for Lengerich!".
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Halle, reports that already after the trade fair on 19. On September 11, a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt Bistro was discovered.
Since the short message at the time was apparently "only" left with an Edding, it could be removed without any problem.
"A few days later, however, it was there again, this time sprayed", says Rottmann.
It assumes that the relevant advertising label must be replaced.
It is precisely this case that gets a special touch by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also called on the board.
If the skate facility is built, the realization of it will also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann of the municipal Department of school, Sport and culture, without naming them.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the subject of skate installation.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
After all, the majority of the council was in favour of the fire brigade car park.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June a u-turn followed.
The members of the main and Finance Committee voted unanimously for the Gutenberg school grounds.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is then the city council.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Congestion in air traffic control is getting worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg after the European air traffic chaos in the summer, the German air traffic controllers see no signs of an improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had Wind, in 2019 we will have strong Wind and then the storm comes," said the head of the Air Traffic Control Union, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency before the aviation summit on May 5, 2012. October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight outages was the long-known shortage of personnel in European air traffic control systems, for which there was no rapid solution.
"Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Europe-wide, the market for fully trained pilots has been cleared.
Around a hundred people were missing in the Karlsruhe Centre alone to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticised the fact that several air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city on Friday representatives of the Federation, the Länder, the air traffic control, the Airlines and the airports come together to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compaction and overtime, this will not go without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the Federal German air traffic control.
Maas again blamed the EU Commission for the plight of pilots.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and staff savings for national air traffic control systems are now fully reflected in the operating business.
Maas appealed to federal minister of transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not further limit the air traffic controllers".
At present, the EU targets would be aligned by 2024 and further tightening would be feared.
The EU is constantly under pressure from Airlines to Lobby.
"Ryanair boss Michael O'leary and his colleagues are now harvesting exactly what they have been sowing themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high costs of delay for the airlines would lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the Situation if the German air traffic control (DFS) offers a" coherent training and future pact", said Maas.
The admission of 120 pilot students per year over the next five years, which has been announced so far, is just enough to compensate for the age-related drop-outs.
The necessary staff structure is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp supervisory board votes for corporate restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp supervisory board voted unanimously in favour of the plans for the restructuring of the group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim CEO Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed chairman of the executive board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-stricken group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their registered office in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should not be any additional staff cuts beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two retreats, the supervisory board on the capital side counts only eight heads.
There are ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
Among other things, the new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with the Indian Partner Tata.
In the second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the elevator and supply business is to be bundled together.
Barcelona: violence at police Demos and Catalan independence advocates.
Two simultaneous demonstrations of Spanish policemen and Catalan independents in Barcelona have led to violent clashes with many injured.
According to the Municipal Administration, on Saturday, about 3000 police officers gathered from all over Spain, as well as about 6000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police have tried with a large bid to keep the two protest moves away from each other.
According to the forces, however, independence supporters repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and throwing bullets.
There were also rumours among the participants of the various protest actions.
According to rescuers, 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their Demonstration, the police wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who, almost exactly a year ago, had fought against the independence referendum banned by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil regard it as unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they do.
The protesters felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police officers of all time demonstrated in Barcelona.
"Why did you come here to protest?"55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez asked the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they've been beating us down a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who wanted to give his name only with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who have just done their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the Demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona, because it is a great European city and there is more Echo here.
However, he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke", assured the police officer.
Glitch allowed access to personal data British Minister

According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known a day before the Tory Congress in Birmingham.

Football: Juve coach praises after top match: Ronaldo's best match
The Portuguese Star striker had played "the best game along with the half an hour from Valencia," said Juve Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) -victory of the championship record-holders against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive Star was even without his own goal the decisive man in the important match against the pursuer.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," Allegri said.
Although we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal-and from that Moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals Juve turned the match after the early gap by Dries Mertens (10th place). In the second half of the 20th century, it was time to stop the worst pursuer for the time being.
The goalscorer, who was raised by Real Madrid, first put on Mario Mandzukic, the former Bundesliga professional, with a double (26./49.) for the leadership provided.
And Ronaldo made a header through a corner and made a header to the goal by head of Defence Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who just had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," the coach praised.
However, Allegri wants to see goals from the attackers, in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team, the record scorer.
"We need to be even better at serving him," said the Coach.
Best Juve goalscorer is currently Mandzukic with four goals-Ronaldo has three in the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the Superiority of Juventus seems to be overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven Games, the flawless series in the Serie A. At 21 points of the masters of the past seven years, is already six points ahead of Naples.
The former Bayer-coach Carlo Ancelotti's cross was not without any chance against Turin.
But at the latest, Mario Rui (58.) the top part was decided.
The Portuguese had to get on too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow and red from the pitch.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented The Coach of Turin.
Emre Can was also able to feel addressed.
The German national has won at Juve.
Liverpool FC's Pro was in action on all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown away from the pitch at the 2: 0 victory of the Turin and is locked for the home game Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes its name
Rapper Kanye West gave a particularly whimsical appearance at the US TV Show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his Performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided frowns and question marks among the spectators.

Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
It's done!
Hoetmar's Averhage coach did not hide his disappointment.
That was a weak Game of ours today.
The enemy was simply gripped, we almost never put him in front of problems". The list of Hoetmar shooting possibilities is correspondingly thin.
The goal is scored twice in 90 minutes, so it is rarely possible to create positive games.
Football-district League A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) photo: Heinz schwa mountain press
The SG also had only two options in the first round, but the first one used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to the early lead (7th).
In the 43. After a great preliminary work by Krause, however, he set free-standing.
The hosts only had a double opportunity when Moritz Höne failed to score Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his champion in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break the visitors were more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all awards.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the goal line with his Hand and looked red - Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use it for the guests (75.).
It was only when Nils Berheide struck the line that the game was decided (81.).
"We had previously criticised ourselves hard, which was then different today than in recent weeks", was the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Horst: J. Scho - Maker-Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77 Send. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Regional League A2 Münster: spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3: 4
"I don't know what to think of it," he said.
"We have no access to them at all". With which he meant presumably the wings of pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other Green-and-White, the apparent need for a collective Offensive.
He could still laugh: "a dirty victory", he said, winked naughty and pulled from then his players, on the other hand, the relief was to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the Championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the maintenance of the class.
With understandably mixed feelings GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes that lay behind him.
"That was by far our best seasonal performance," he says.
"How we come back after 0:2, how we keep against one of the top teams of the league over the entire season, that was really phenomenal".
The more bitter it seems that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner brought the hosts with his 12. Season goal in lead (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this match for this goal.
The 2:0 he put on the left side of the pattern to be valid for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but such a player can not just take out completely.
"That was already madness, what he did", Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent enviously.
Shortly before the break, his own Eleven managed compensation: McGill's free-kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through it into the far corner of the net (45.).
After the side change it was again McGill who scored the equaliser (59.).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later, Patrick Horstmann equalized (69.).
Albersloh failed to score the last Concordia goal (80.) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, this is what we need to win," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg-Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen-Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill-Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Goals: 1: 0 Zymner (24.), 2: 0 Fröhning (39.), 2: 1 McGill (45.), 2: 2 McGill (59.), 3: 2 dowels (64.), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80.).

Erdogan in Germany: politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he left.
There are only a few state guests, whose departure in Germany provides such great relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days was the Turkish president in Berlin and Cologne, and many had meant that he should not have been invited.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers around 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France's President, Emmanuel Macron, has signalled his intention to pick up the tolerance prize personally in Tutzing.
The term of office was too short for Christian Wulff: as a federal president, he was not in Tutzing's evangelical academy.
But before and after, Wulff was there as a guest.
This was how academic director Udo Hahn expected him when he proudly said:"all federal presidents and Chancellor were already with us". The fact that celebrities appear at the Academy in Tutzing Castle repeatedly, however, was also a topic during the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective. On September 11, the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: he wants to personally receive the "tolerance prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The 80 or so meetings held by mid-2019 will be held.
"The pension is just not safe!"in a meeting title.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the"risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "barbarism without Limit".
Weapons eals, destruction, torture, death-the war mocks any humane idea".
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change in work through digitisation.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced that "A free democracy where civil society can come together to search for solutions or at least partial solutions".
At a meeting held on the 200th anniversary of the death of the King
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Karl Marx, one of the visitors to the direction of capitalism will soon expect criticism, the other will expect a tendency "from the left to the center".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a subsidiary of the Evangelical Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are 100% neutral".
Music cabinet: gender understanding with Herz-Wolbeck-Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical Cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the Hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner put forward the gender understanding, not only with Humor and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) Man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The Mini-guitar she used and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
The is a male sparring partner, sometimes even to the end of the sentence to words, and on the other a true Pianist: So congenial and harmonious Süverkrüp Teubner accompanied that some may have a Solo desired.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely, as it fit to the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had put a paradox into play: the satisfaction of Man comes, if he had a partner, but this does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano Solo demonstrates the same thing: what would have come from the composing of Mozart had "the Nannerl" opened the door unhooked?
From Bach's "O Haupt full of blood and wounds" to the "song of death", and from Mozart's G minor symphony to a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, to the Chansonette.
However, the Chairwoman Heidemarie mark Beck was an additional thanks to not take.
She had the idea to treat the Duo to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as in Wolbeck.

The extensive exclusion of the German public had "strengthened many reservations".

From pure fruit to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the association for horticulture and land care was celebrated with a Gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On 29. On September 11, 1893, a fruit show at the Kulmbach club house set the last impetus for the foundation of the Kulmbach District Association for horticulture and land maintenance, and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday evening, he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbach town hall.
However, it was called "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" in 1893 that he was baptized by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit-growing, about flowers and horticulture no one thought back then.
To be declared "in those days, in the era of the enlightenment, was the fruit tree is a favorite child of the elites", a circle home nurse Günter Dippold in his speech.
Fruit trees should be lined highways, schools have so-called industrial Gardens.
Fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A close-to-nature horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the teaching of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Moles" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said District Chairman Günter Reif, and whether Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The chestnut picking was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect similar joy with Smartphone & co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, decides the district association," added Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of horticultural associations for the villages.
The District Association stands for Ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district, left no doubt about it also district manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the Kreisverband with a lecture and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
Everything used to come out of the garden, for the Winter it was docked.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the commercial garden had turned into a ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has existed, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it", the expert for fruit and nut trees pleaded.
That is why there is an incentive for horticultural associations not to let go, so that our home remains beautiful and liveable.
This also included welcoming the new citizens in our clubs, added Wolfram Vaitl, president of the Bavarian state association.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower blowers of the Musikverein Thurnau.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the newspaper "O Globo".
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63 - year-old will perform public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician was attacked at the beginning of September during an election campaign in southern Brazil on the open road.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the Ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations against Bolsonaro made racist and women-violating statements mobile.
In the economic metropolis of São Paulo, several thousand protesters were expected.
In the capital, Brasilia protests with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian workers party (PT), Fernando Haddad mixed.
He was replaced by former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil took place on 7 April. October.
As Ex-mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in surveys.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but has recently been presented as an Anti-System candidate.
If none of the candidates reaches the absolute majority in the first round of the election, there will be no vote on 28 February. October a runaway election.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this successfully-no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known for hating homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocked with verbal gaffes.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula's left Workers Party were to be shot.

Rocknacht at Schuhfabrik: volume up to compressed air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger". Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "the Ignition" suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the Hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure of three mutually friendly Bands.
After the sound check and just before the concert begins, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No sign of lamp fever.
After that, the Rock-protagonists in Ahlen and surroundings - all in conjunction with the Booking-Agency "Mosquito" from Oelde to inspire visually - with their Bands loudly around 120 visitors to the "Mint Mosquito"-rock night.
Even the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw"with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows to convince at the beginning of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage is danced at the performance to the harmonious and expressive interplay of the Band.
Although "encore"Calls are not to be ignored, left to "Tiger Bonesaw" the Trio "Here We Stand" stage.
The fact that Hard Rock is not the same as Hard Rock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on Bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic Rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" comes in "Here We Stand"in addition to the guitar rock a Synthesizer.
Not only the longing, almost balladlike "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered Songs.
The Quartet "The Ignition", tönnis house has earned, however, since its inception in the year 2005 a special level of awareness.
On Saturday, the Band will be presenting their hard rock full of agility.
"The Ignition" documented with their performances in front of very large audiences - most recently in a Film by Max Meis about the tour in China to 2017 - special stage experience is obvious and unmistakable.
Vocalist and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the Band, also sets his own accents on the only covered Song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
On the other hand, Norbert Brinkmann, who was still more active at the time, was able to deliver a highly acclaimed Solo while he was running through the audience.
At the "Mint Mosquito" - Rocknacht, according to information from the mixing team at the three-concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "the Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the compressed-air hammer level, but is thus still well below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval", pointing to the "the Ignition" on their website.
Deafening 120 decibels in nozzle operation volume as usual with the annual Metal Show in the north of the Republic, the Ahlener audience does not need at this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three Bands of the harder, Rocky gait have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger", all three groups, of course in a figurative sense, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead sailplane accident at Essen / Mülheim airport
At Mülheim / Essen airport, a fatal accident occurred.
In a parking lot at the airport Mülheim/Essen a glider crashed on Sunday.
The Pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
As the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung " reports, a sailplane crashed at the airport's parking lot.
The Pilot was killed.
As the " WAZ " continues to report, the flying student was alone on board - the aircraft is said to be a single-seater.
The aircraft had already been in the approach at the time of the accident.
The crash site is located just a short distance from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But since this weekend an Oktoberfest takes place.
Mülheim / Essen airport is located on the city border of the two Ruhr cities and directly on the motorway 52.

"And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that, despite the nuclear crisis, the US president of North Korea, Kim, is well-mannered.
Now Trump has made his colleagues, but a real Declaration of love.
The also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
In the tender age of 72 years, the married U.S. president has become known to a new flame.
The tragic: it's a long-distance relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. State of West Virginia, Trump found almost tenderly words for the half-so-old shoot-out of the reign dynasty of Pyongyang, although the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament proves to be quite tough chunks.
"I was hard-hitting, he too, and between us it went back and forth," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only did the talks with Kim melt his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Trump referred to Kim's announcement of a halt to all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service.
The US president seemed to be aware that the affection for the notorious "Rocket Man" - as Trumps nicknamed for Kim - was not likely to be amusing.
In any case, he took the expected criticism at his appearance in a large sports hall of the city of Wheeling straight ahead: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so unpractical.
"I have always told you that it is so simple to be presiding."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this bulging Arena, but we'd only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler

Refugees rescued thanks to video from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees have drawn attention to their catastrophic conditions of detention in Libya with the help of a mobile phone video, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had shot the recording in their cell in the seaside town of Sawija in July under the threat of death and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the Website "France 24 Observers", whose editors, the International organization for Migration (IOM) alarm.
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the Video, we would probably not have been able to return to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who recorded the Video, the news agency AFP.
The 25 - year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
In his own words, he put himself in danger of death with the Video.
One of his associates was almost beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "they beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the Latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the United Nations Security Council (UNRWA) announced that it would not be able to provide humanitarian aid to the victims of the terrorist attack in Nigeria.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not unusual in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a call for help on a mobile phone Video.
International organisations have long criticised the situation in the Libyan refugee camps as unworthy of people.

Laschet calls for the rule of law in Turkey 
Cologne, NRW-prime minister Armin Laschet (CDU), in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, claimed that the rule of law in Turkey had been invoked.
The two countries ' relations are currently "overshadowed", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This concerns above all arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He had therefore made it clear at Erdogan "that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this".
According to Laschet, the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey were also mentioned.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
In response, Erdogan stressed once again the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the German Defense Ministry's Flight Readiness at Cologne airport in the short term.
Originally it was supposed to take place at wahn Castle - but the castle owners had rejected it because of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the interview, Erdogan continued to travel to the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
He said: "The Muslims in this mosque, are also citizens of our country".
And we are also their contacts-and not the Turkish President.
Lack of trust in the USA: North Korea's requirement for disarmament
While US President, Trump is not tired to emphasize the achievements in the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian Regime, the conditions sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for Washington to meet.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government in the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The recent standstill comes from the fact that the US is relying on coercive measures that are deadly for confidence-building," said Ri in New York.
In this context, disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there will be no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees "is"a dream of people who do not know us".
In order to build trust, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasized.
However, there were no "corresponding responses" from the US side, the Minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council alone decided three times sanctions against the internationally isolated country last year.
US President Donald Trump and his foreign minister Mike Pompeo have been pushing the United Nations to strictly comply with the sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working towards a rapprochement.
In June, for the first time, Trump had met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang for talks on the termination of the North Korean nuclear weapons programme.
The HoT served: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors to the House of the open door HoT got nothing with it: white blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large Buffet waited for the guests after the thanksgiving service.
The youngsters of the HoT had the Buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen conjured up.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
As Henriette Westbuer, the manager of the HoT, remembers, the Start with the new facility was not easy.
We had our refrigerators filled with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: a power failure had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start over again: although we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbours, the children and young people wanted to do it alone," says Westbuer.
And so everyone was grabbing.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Cooks can't do better," a visitor was impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to serve Quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have set up," said Pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen with card tricks and other pieces of art surprised.

Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen table had introduced a stop for foreigners.

Too many have fallen in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the state association of North Rhine-Westphalia, expressed an understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy to the dpa.
The sharp criticism had taken Sartor.
"I can understand his step - people who didn't know exactly why the Essen board did it."
But Sartor is still active for the dinner table - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
In the "Welt am Sonntag", Sartor again criticised colleagues from other panels.
It is not possible to follow the approach of "without us, the people of the city starve".
It was the responsibility of the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not participate in a Congress of tables on Friday in Berlin.
"There's too much sweet Smurfs told me," he said.
There are all these social Fuzzis, who have criticised me at that time as well.

FC Bayern München beat FC Bayern München to win the UEFA Champions League
FC Bayern München's defeat in Berlin is not to be missed.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the term of Niko Kovac.
The first small stage under the new coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase for the Munich people to the greater autumn low.
"A week ago, we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we've got a bit of a bit of reality," said Thomas Müller after the deserved 2-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Who knows us, The knows, that really annoys us and we give it to Tuesday Gas.
For the first time since more than a year away No own goal shot, as at the same time of the preseason two Compulsory Games in series without victory, the lead in the Bundesliga lost for the time being to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record-breaking champion has to be warned.
FC Augsburg's 1-1 draw with his intense man-against-Man tactics and the Berliners, through their playful needle-strokes over the outside, delivered two blueprints within three days, as the Bayern seem to be overpowering.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything we can to ensure that we succeed again," Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he dealt with his losers in his native city surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as a Munich Coach only on the once again deficient handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless leave the first interim conclusion of his term of office positive - otherwise the tone is likely to worsen.
For example, Kovac did not take any extraordinary action before the second royal class appearance this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday begins as planned, the short preparation for the second pre-round match against Ajax, which at the start AEK Athens also sovereignly defeated with 3:0.
"Now we're in two games, but we're going to make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the Lost Cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place spoke above all Joshua Kimmich plaintext.
The right-wing defender acted as Mahner.
"I don't think this is bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes back," said the 23-year-old just before departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh matchday of the previous season, Bayern were even five behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with a point lead.
And so Kimmich gave a wink at least positively, that now the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bayern has come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the midfielder.
It's good for the league.
The DFB Boss in the line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack from Erdogan to Grindel
The Turkish President Erdogan is denouncing the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany with serious allegations.
DFB president Grindel sees errors, but defends the association line.
A new post is to be created.
Berlin - on different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the interpretation of the permanent issue of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president at the opening of the great DITIB mosque in Cologne strongly criticized the handling of the Ex-world champion in Germany, the DFB boss defended the association line.
On early Sunday morning, Grindel, personally attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the Causa in the Mainz ZDF-"Sportstudio".
"In the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that this is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win an international player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan was not in favour of football and DFB.
In sharp words, he had denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and grown-up Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they took pictures with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the cathedral city.
Honestly, I could not digest it, as your President, that our two young men, who have risen up in the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced his intention to face players in the future.
Someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I am a Migrant.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said so.

Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the west on the mountains
Ms. Holle shakes her beds in the West for the first time next week: polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists at the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall threshold at the beginning of the week drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters at strong intensity.
From the Bregenzerwald forest to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of new snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.

Farmers are allowed to start on Monday with the annual kink care 
Schleswig-Holstein farmers are allowed to start the annual care of buckling on Monday.
The "green ramparts", unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the German state of forest for around 200 years.
The trees and shrubs, which are up to five metres wide, are "forest replacement" and for many animals and plants the last retreat.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of an order of the Danish King Christian VI.in 1766, which ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundary and livestock fence, they also supplied firewood and beams to the farmers for their half-timbered houses.
His Name "kink" also comes from that time: the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop by "bending" the branches.
Today, between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, some 45 000 kilometres of hedges extend and impart the image of a wooded, multifaceted landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by about 7000 animal species as a substitute habitat.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one Kilometer of a bend and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the buckling can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in the Winter.
In addition to biodiversity, it also reduces the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, buckling care may only be carried out outside the breeding season from October to March.

When I learned about the Tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport in Palu was closed at that time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which are completely destroyed.

Because many grocery stores and even the gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service has completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the prisoners walk freely around and finding them is difficult.
There are still many corpses around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.

At the Moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that it did not work and we only got information about the Radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people who do not know if they live and where they are, because during the earthquakes people were not at home, but for example at work.
The Tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons, but when the clear came, many thought "Okay, no Tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions, which were not hit by the Tsunami, there was the misinformation that a Tsunami will hit the Region and they ran on the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific fire ring not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We know normally, how we respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure collapsed, the earthquake hit a lot of people.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in the turbo pace
The time is extremely short and the number of interviews planned is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at Turbotempo, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the sheer majority for Brett Kavanaugh, the controversial judge candidate due to allegations of coercion.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for investigators until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The recent change in the Drama about Kavanaughs ' vocation accompanied by a cultural struggle was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first Prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the Jurist angry tirades against the opposition Democrats stepped out, the Senate justice committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge at the Supreme U.S. Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends accepted.
President Trump, who had described the severe pretences on Thursday as "bullying", initially abstained from further attacks against women and spoke, on the contrary, of"happiness in disaster".
In this way, final doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later on, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply at a rally because they reject Kavanaugh: "they try to block and destroy".
Trump lays out the FBI's investigation in the case of Kavanaugh 
Also, the White House has extremely limited the powers of investigators.
One of the main reasons for this is that it is not possible for the government to investigate the known accusations of two women, no more, said a government representative to the "Wall Street Journal": "they do not go on a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar of the municipality of Ried installed in a "civil vehicle" to monitor the speed limit is according to the municipality from Monday, 1. On the evening of October 10, at the Gartenstraße stationed.

FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: fear has been felt
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first victory of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the time factor played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen-it is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge Pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home match against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every Ball in it.
And there were many corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area," said Schalke 04's sports director - and breathed up.
After all, the royal blue still managed to bring the knappe 1:0 against the Rhine Hesse over time and thus the first win of the season under roof and compartment.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the tour by Alessandro Schöpf 11. the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given security to Tedesco: "overall, the first half was good, both playful and Pressing". obviously, as the game progressed, the head became more and more important.
Schöpf actually no headball monster
"The last ten minutes feels like two hours," said Heidel: "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore kept retreating.
And defended with Man and mouse against Mainz.
In order to save the first three points of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from our hearts," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant share of it with his header goal: "I am actually the worst header player in the world."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the Arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start with pressure in the initial phase and make a firework out of it," said Schalke's chief coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the Fans.
We have played intelligently, quietly and bravely, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the greatest drawback of the afternoon: royal blue missed it, rather to provide clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example, by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit twice the bar 59./It's a good idea. or amines Harit 62.
"Then it would not have been a tremor victory," Tedesco said:"You have already felt the fear a bit".
So I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: column of smoke in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses Integration: a discussion at eye level
In front of you, the author, Professor doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to get for many years, interesting people, according to Greven," explains the founder and Chairman of the "stretching fields of clubs" - the Association that cooperates with the alignment of the Evening, with the Alliance "cultural policy".
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, speaks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, tangible figures and a joke, he brings to the listeners one of the most conflict-ridden topics: Migration and Integration.
Why are there increasing conflicts despite successful Integration?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at one table, first Generation migrants at the cat's table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to get to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, the decisive factor is not whether one classifies itself politically on the right or on the left, but: "am I in favour or against an open society?"he emphasizes.
Initially rather behave, then more and more lively the discussion begins.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful Integration of students.
El-Mafaalani stands before, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: it is on par.
The sociology Professor does not impose his opinion, stresses that he's speaking of the average, not individual destinies.
He is pleased that interest in the subject, because "only when we understand what the Problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the following signing session, he was still listening to the questions of the guests and also in the Foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, intensively discussed.

Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land plots in Landsham-South.
The community of Pliening has sold the first land in the new development area offices-South on the free market.
That's what Mayor Roland Frick tells us.
In addition, the application phase has been completed for those 20 plots offered by the municipality at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the former domestic model.
A good 100 applications were received, according to Frick.
"Currently the documents are checked", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.

The award could then be made.
A total of 50 land plots for single and double houses will be created on the area in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-family homes with eight residential units expected.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and paths are to be paved soon.

With a total of 16 free state-sponsored, income-oriented housing.

This is how Schalke's Naldo "great Sport" succeeds on the bench as well
For the third time in a row not in the starting line: still, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - after Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time in a row had not sat in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people, if the almost two-Meter-tall Brazilian had once really talked about the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle as usual after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom all simply call Naldo, turned on and said: "We have to thank you, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great Sport," later told Tedesco about the reaction of his vice-captain, who had no resentment despite his renewed reservists.
It is likely that Naldo, who has been hailed as the best Schalker in the past season, knows that his coach is not really on the sidelines - but that he gets a break for good reasons.
A reason called "Stress Control".
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I tell you honestly," Tedesco reported from the Moment he told Naldo that he was not in the starting line.
He's an important player, he's an important Person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club", Tedesco explained the step.
Naldo has played against Bayern and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can get through at this time.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the Rotation, which has finally caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself as an exemplary team player at the Bank.
The mood in Austria's industry continued to accelerate its downward trend in August compared to the euro zone.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) stood at 46.7 points on a 37-month low.
On Monday, the Markit Institute reported on its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro Zone PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the Index still stands at 13. Month in a row below the mark of 50 counters, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry collapsed in August with 50.9 points.
The Greeks were at the bottom (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the sentiment barometer declined, but at a slower pace than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March at 44.0 points.
"The slightly weaker descent could mean that the worst is over," said Markit Economist Rob Dobson.
However, industry remains the number one growth brake in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: The export orders in the Eurozone dropped since November 2011.
The company has grown, therefore, the seventh month in a row.
In China, too, industrial production fell more sharply in August than initially expected.
The sentiment barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Manager Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial enterprises.
The survey includes developments in turnover, employment, stocks and prices.
