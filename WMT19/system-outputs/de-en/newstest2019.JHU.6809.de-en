Yes, she wants...
"Beautiful Munich" will be in 2018!
In the afternoon, another surprise awaits our candidates: They will not be alone in the romantic candlelight shooting in front of MY Solaris, but at the side of Male model Fabian!
Hvar - flirting, cooking, seducing - no easy task for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Schöne Müncherin" candidates deliver in the shooting with people photographer Tuan and defy wind, spray and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shooting can be seen in the video:
DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil's comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that you get into a conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other of these things, as stated in his statement," Grindel said in the soccer podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung."
Despite months of debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-times national player Özil.
"I would have been delighted if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I've also assumed at some point that this would be the case, "Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and justified it on the grounds that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The head of the DFB repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows from football that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a shame that this conversation hasn't come about so far."
Linz: Garden hut burned in Schrebergartensiedlung
At 2.13pm, the Linz fire brigade was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was in default.
The professional fire brigade pulled out and found the hut in full fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be practically completely removed and fire debris had to be removed to the extent that was absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had injected a battery into the store at lunchtime.
That could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the area of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, as the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to take the children away from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself streamed live, as she seems to want to take the children away from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ," which publishes a partial recording of the streams.
Here you can see "Kissed for Happiness" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, Lohan can be seen getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family she wants to be identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of child trafficking.
She doesn't provide any evidence for all of this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this," Lohan can be heard saying in the video as she continues to follow the family along the road.
She seems to be trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to have had enough.
It looks like she is turning around and Lohan is missing a slap in the face.
In tears, the actress then affirms how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to take this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is said to be so close to asteroid Ryugu that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The "Mascot" lander will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of people killed in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
At least 420 people have died following the severe 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated the devastated areas, which have been cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla chief executive
In the beginning, there was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in stock markets in early August when he announced a retreat of the elevator car.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but the two have now reached an agreement.
Tesla and Musk will have to pay, and the Tesla CEO will resign from the board, but he will be allowed to remain CEO.
British Conservative Party Congress
Tightly guarded - the Tories' party congress
Birmingham is becoming the scene of a power struggle.
The party conference is expected to focus on foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the row between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, on the frontline of ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already reached an agreement
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over these name duplications for years.
Now they have come to an agreement.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future, and the population will vote on it this Sunday - whether things are going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before Brazil's presidential election, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" presents itself as an anti-system candidate and is thus ahead in the polls.
His fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" refurbishment takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," Peter Mertens, head of development, told the industry publication "Automobilwoche."
In December 2017, Audi Chief Executive Rupert Stadler, who was detained and detained, announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"All engine / gearbox combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018," he said at the time.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in dealing with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was set up in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car maker has made "serious organisational changes" to ensure that such a scandal never happens again.
The VW Supervisory Board postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and intends to discuss it further this Tuesday.
Investigators are accusing the Audi boss of allowing the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the exhaust gas cheats were revealed.
In doing so, he knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Chief Sales Officer Bram Schot is managing the company as acting Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronn Voice."
In principle, he sees a decline in demand for limousines such as the A6, A7 and A8 audio models, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot is committed to electric mobility.
The e-tron, the first Audi electric car, has already received 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm is to be elected to the DFB Presidium
Mainz (DPA) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for the post of DFB president again next year, despite criticism of him after the World Cup and the Özil affair.
"I'm doing my job and I'm trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning at ZDF's "current sports studio."
You have to keep trying to get re-elected, that's what I'm going to do.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if, after winning the 2024 European Championship, he did not "want to work on the project for the future."
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 in place of Wolfgang Niersbach, who was overthrown over the summer fairytale affair.
In the fall of 2016, he was elected for a first full three-year term.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future European Championship chief organizer, Philipp Lahm, is to work with the DFB Presidium.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau would agree that he will continue to advise in this role in the Bureau and then, of course, be cordially invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to take part in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migrant background should become an integration ambassador for the DFB.
Currently, this office is held by Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter of whom has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says," The issue is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Remove properly with semi-clever scales
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scales that not only measures my weight, but also the percentage of body fat.
It can also display muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the sausage.
He doesn't say anything about whether I have replaced fat with muscles.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear kick-off for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-champion easily won with 112: 55 (52: 31) and provided a convincing match for more than 40 minutes.
Newcomer Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer in the dominant Berlin with 20 points.
National player Johannes Thiemann (18 meters), who is committed from Ludwigsburg, also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators on his compulsory play debut.
Ex-champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84: 80 (39: 37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best scorer among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came in at 14.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist, MHP giant Ludwigsburg, defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83: 76 (41: 34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the best shooter on the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
Basketball Lions Brunswick had a clear 100: 64 (48: 30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker, Will Cummings, surpassed the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
Brunswick, where NBA star Dennis Schroeder has been the majority owner since the start of the season, was disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run by the Baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, among others, during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
The Cologne city centre was partially closed for the opening of the Ditib mosque.
Several thousand police officers were deployed - among them snipers.
The Islamic Association of Ditib has been criticized for being an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: Stars, booze and horror
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have been campaigning for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Get involved wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and a golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations, also appeared on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a horror moment when many viewers thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was shots, got scared and tried to flee.
There was a brief panic, and people ran into each other.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organiser, Hugh Evans.
However, New York police and musician Chris Martin reassured people from the scene.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available for free on the internet.
If you wanted to get one, you had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there were cheers and applause from the audience - but for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He, along with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke out on the stage in favour of greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had argued in the US Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, knocking many women off their heads.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape of Kavanaugh, which he denies.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who say they have experienced sexual assault themselves, confronted him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also meet me in an elevator at any time," Flake said to the crowd at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends journalist's eviction
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist, who lives in Hamburg, was wearing a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the front row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert told the Bild am Sonntag.
It was a matter of disrupting the course of the press conference.
The journalist's actions have caused a great deal of unrest, which is unacceptable.
For this reason, he had arranged for guards to bring the man out.
Seibert said it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, a large number of journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged spying or supporting or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities either: Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was only arrested at the beginning of September.
Most recently, the cases of jailed journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel have caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but trials are still underway in Turkey against the two of them.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You've got to look at it twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht," produced by the NDR, is known for cheerful conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten."
Presenter Ina Müller and her guests come up with some beer, some wine or even more high-percentage drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory singing inserts.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time, the actor Florian David Fitz is known for films such as "Men's Hearts," "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Most Horny Day."
But the trip to the far north didn't get a good deal for Munich.
On Saturday, he posted a SELFIE - his face is completely scratched on it, his eyes just two small slits.
The bed SELFIE shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not ill, he only has a mighty hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NIE is going to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And the round of egg liqueur, which Ina casts at half past three, is also letting go.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans poured in a few tips to fight back.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most purposeful - headache tablets.
Others were simply amused by the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
It is not yet known how Ina Müller survived the nocturnal blaze.
However, as she has been moderating the TV fun at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has struggled with vandalism and rubbish
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long track in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is hard to find and tidy.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Shards, cigarette tips, rubbish and rubbish, demolished dustbin and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the flagship railway bike trail in the Rotkäppchenland, a more than unfathomable sight.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also by others for a long time, according to the city's cycling commissioner, Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been raised in the cycling advisory board.
So far, there has been no solution.
The proposals ranged from the laying of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also introduced the topic to the local council.
It's not just the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often noisy, but the joints are also destroyed: Posts are torn out of the ground, dustbin is demolished, signs are bent over, seating furniture is lubricated.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the resting place on the bike trail in Treysa is a meeting place for scattering.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus here is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "It may well raise the threshold for attacking the common good.
However, this would presuppose that a police riot would then pass by in a timely manner.
As a matter of principle, Wüstenhagen wants the Haaße hill to develop.
It needs to be made more attractive.
In fact, one can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany, "said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in Ascheröder Strasse in Treysa to be extremely critical.
There is no turn-off on the Haaße hill.
In case of heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the road, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but it is a problem for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Go of Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D to offer a song for Hiltrup," is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "Music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with eyebrows in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family affair with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-time Albachtener living in Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben," three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city yet.
What did the lyrics look like?
The Hiltruper lake and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned in the localities.
In his hit song, Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue as "Hiltrup's birthplace."
The cultural railway station has also been recognised.
Time and again, it was a matter of living together in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short renovation breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
Humberg was told that he had actually studied chemistry, but now he is also teaching guitar.
Franke was informed by sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the programme.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has put a lot on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others could listen to their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied will be able to record an entire CD with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "A very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children performed again at the finale - and sounded "really good," as Franke said, even without electronic support.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, responsiveness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Business Association, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She regarded the event as a complete success.
Everyone is "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon-to-be very full cultural railway station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side, there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which - the old trick with the red foil - can only be deciphered once you have put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side will not be able to read anything by mistake.
On the maps, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Cubes.
4. Feast. "
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
For it is not the terms that are to be guessed here, but codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card that says "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto," it is not the terms behind the secret foil that are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice," "festival" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, as far as possible; because that wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encrypter notes and reads out loud: "Throw" for the cubes, "lots" as a contrast to festival; here, of course, something like "party" and "Prague" would be possible, because he watched at school and knows the windows there.
That's how it goes round by round, team by team.
One does not know the terms of the opposite side - but it can be better combined with every hint that the encrypter gives there.
The transcripts should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, otherwise it will be unnecessarily difficult for his team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanatory video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you get started, you'll be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, though, "Decrypto" isn't quite as conclusive as predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames," which also puts an agent's name on a game of fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you're only interested in scoring and not winning points, you can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate twice in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler salute in the Upper Town of a passing police station, then later he also appeared in a pub in the Upper Town when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly intoxicated by the police, he was forced to spend the night at the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate in the detention centre.
In a sober state, he will then also have to face criminal charges for using registration plates of unconstitutional organisations.
Pressig plant was home to the Schubloks
The railway plant in Pressig has been the hub in the Frankenwald region for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history came to an end.
"When buffers were banging on buffers, you heard it all over the place," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the town and the railway station.
That didn't bother anyone.
Then the brakes squeezed and the wagons snapped.
That was pure railway.
Statements that are emblematic of Dinkel's hometown of Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point for the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which, after an ascent of around 220 metres in altitude, has its vertex in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, train and drag locomotives, which had their home in Pressig, were used in the past.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotives, an apprenticeship workshop, a steering line and a railway masterpiece.
"The centrepiece was the hub, which, after a reconstruction in 1899, had a diameter of 18 metres," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and 47-year-old professional seismist.
The Pressig railway station (BW), which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the side routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the 1939 line has already minimised the need for train and drag locomotives.
From 1977, they were only used for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10,000 weights were still ranked in the month.
Parts of the plant were demolished in 1982 and the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is unfortunate that we did not envisage a better use of the site, also in terms of freight transport."
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated the anniversary of "50 years of electrification in Nuremberg - Saalfeld," a pompous railway station festival in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, the end.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were taken away, and the Pressig shunting station was history.
"The rangers and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any wrongdoing would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen railway station has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places, and many more historical and current images can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with kick-off success at China Open
Beijing (DPA) - Women's doubles champion Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing, just like Julia Görges did before.
Kerber won the China Open 6-2, 6-2 against France's Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent in the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kasachsten or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6-3, 4-2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian, ranked 13th, gave up.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the "Art and enjoyment" series, a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach at the weekend.
Organisers and visitors were very relieved to see the ideal weather when the special opening "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open-air area of the property in Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It will take place under the umbrella of the "Rund um Walberla" tourism association as part of the "Art and enjoyment" series.
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be seen in Mittelehrenbach.
The owner of the house, Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann, welcomed the artists to the opening of the opening.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his task into proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have played an active part in the selection of artists in the past and have been involved in the design of flyers.
Once again this year, on the occasion of art and enjoyment, there is a 70-cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn Austanz," designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high level of support for the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framing.
As you walk through the spacious garden, it quickly becomes clear to the visitor that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with colourful accents.
Already at the entrance to the property, the visitor on the right-hand side of the "Lucky Tree" is waiting for the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully equipped with 20 wind turbines, 24 horseshoe and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the Buschwerk in the background, the object looks like a fairy tale and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate herself in three-dimensional letters to the event of 15 years of K & G.
There are many parts, in the wind, in motion.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child."
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colourful imagination of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme of "Windspiel Performance" is to stroll through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition will be open until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 nightmares: Singer celebrates 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the nightmares also gave way to their displeasure at the time.
At least five of them.
They didn't want to come to terms with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia," there should no longer be a singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: On a bench in the Tinnenbusch, they baptised the MGV 68 nightclub.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary has been celebrated in the "House of Encounters."
"It's going to be full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
Specifically to mark the anniversary, they had revived the festival.
For years it was a tradition, and then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it was asked for festive clothes beforehand.
As usual, the guests did not sit in rows of seats in the "House of Encounters," but cozy at tables.
In between, movement was called for: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled up the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten made their own voice heard.
To coincide with the occasion, cheerful songs were announced.
Almost already set: "Such a day, as beautiful as it is today."
In keeping with the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheim wine."
Alluding to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" resonated, which is the Latin term for "hops."
The choir management of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time, was once again sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege: "He's such an easy guy, it's a masterpiece he's doing." By the way, this time it wasn't just men who were singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had been sitting at his desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented fine-sounding poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds will be used to fund a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd women's league: USC II wins top-class derby against BW Aasee
The ascendant marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster, under the patronage of Axel Büring, is right in League Three.
No trace of shyness or fracksausen, the independents are doing their thing.
And that's really good when it comes to 3: 0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against city rivals BW Aasee.
"It wasn't crystal clear, but we've already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied. "On the contrary.
In the evening, at a subsequent birthday celebration by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was off.
Yes, the result is, in fact, an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they make it to the finish line, such a game can tip over," Büring knows from years of experience.
In the end, the USC, with its routine forces, made everything clear and brought the full yield to the finish line.
'We're all aware of who's on the other side of such a derby.
It doesn't break our neck.
I've seen really good volleyball in phases, "Annacker didn't hurt with the 0: 3 - and immediately moved on to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the Independents does not seem to be foreseeable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early to do that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The third league has an unbelievably good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball. "In the fourth league, they don't want to turn their gaze downwards anymore.
If the vest is not polluted in the next few weeks, they will have to look up.
However, a first assessment can only be made after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday, we'll go to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on 14 October.

Glider crashes - flight attendant fatally injured
The pilot died in the crash of a glider in Essen.
The one-seat plane crashed into a parking lot near Essen-Mülheim Airport on Sunday afternoon when it landed, a police spokesman said in Essen on Sunday.
The parking lot next to Highway 52, which is normally used for shuttle traffic to the fair, was largely empty, and other people were not injured in the crash.
Emergency responders continued to take care of flight students and eyewitnesses on site.
In the immediate vicinity was the venue of an Oktoberfest, and in the evening numerous guests were expected there.
The cause of the crash was initially unclear - the weather was good, there was light wind and sunshine.
Essen-Mülheim is a small airport, which is used a lot by pilots with light private planes.
About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the "dream ship."
Now she is talking openly about the fact that the series may have been complicit in her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Ledebur's chief hostess, Beatrice, on the "dream ship," made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she went on board forever.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she had been married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason, too.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many of my admired colleagues noticed me at eye level, "Keller said in an interview with" Bild am Sonntag. "
At first, she was always "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "dream ship."
For now, the journalists only appealed to Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much."
She thinks it's possible that her husband at the time might have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans was scared of talking about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried to be the only right person for Hans von Borsody, and he didn't want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've changed my mind, "she explains.
She always felt she was "not good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman who I had never really been, even though I sometimes seemed cheeky and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever. "
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the official wedding, I sat in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why did it never work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love at the time, "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I'm far too naive about love. '
The Nachtfalter, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ district of Zurich, has this time ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our folder is not a moth, but a little light-shy.
And the Grelle shine, in which a green carpet is immersed on the six-seater square, dazzles him too much.
But it's just a film festival, where more or less celebrities want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
On this late Thursday evening, he tore over the square to make himself a little easier in the "Aquaclean WC Oasis."
This is the name given to the public toilet system, sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: The needle centre in the parterre of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to create a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, in the men's oasis, it stinks to heaven for some reason.
So out here, over to the other side of the road: Invited guests, who have just entertained at the best level in the cinema next door to the opening film "Green Book," are celebrating the start of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store, just like every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: It is well known that the works on display come from all over the world.
What you don't have to think of in an article about this festival, in order not to fall into creepy advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The folder binds a ribbon around the sensors, which has put a good fairy in it, and two bulky doormen actually wave it in generously.
Inside, the invited people crowd, dancing to live music well after midnight, or let DJ set rhythms to which they scream at each other, and rinse down with Cüpli's exquisite snacks.
In the delicatessen shop in Souterrain, oysters are waiting for muddy mouths; next door, the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut up, and a chocolate fountain is sparkling.
And the hammer is: All the shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studies the sign on the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator."
If these are two separate instructions, he has missed out on the dressing code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the chicken tops a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye," matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting this brand for years, is not here for the evening either.
But there, between local prominence, cash table and kitchen items, a face that is familiar to the observer is pulling over: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His protagonist should not be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, soon to be sixty, almost like a choir boy, walks through the crowd.
It is not squatted, it is not buried, it is at most stolen.
International stars love this film festival, especially for this reticence, which is often misunderstood as disgusting.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dancing
Coach and former soccer star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team's victory.
Argentina's soccer legend Diego Maradona appears to have settled in well in his new homeland of Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory for his club, Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to Cumbia-Rythmen with a player in the cabin, as seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, fired by the players.
The Mexican second-division champion had defeated the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona shouted into a TV camera, "Always with my guys, always."
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: League 1: ASV send "destroyed on the ground" after last-minute bust-up
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat." His shooters were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29: 30 (12: 14) - bust - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they didn't play badly over long periods, the Sendener.
Only the initial phase "we slept completely," the ASV coach was annoyed.
The hosts quickly led with 8: 1, even the early break, which Bieletzki had taken, didn't bother at first.
"But then all of a sudden a Ruck went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the gap was only two goals.
In particular, Senden's best man, Marius Hintze, hit the stage once and for all.
After the change, it got even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalised at 15: 15, followed by the relay changer almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29: 26).
And then?
The non-partisans intervened in the event.
Bieletzki is usually wary of seeking blame from others.
But: Steffen Mühlhoff's 120-second time penalty was "a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The guys fought great, stood well in the back against seven men and repeatedly threw them into the empty gate.
But they can't buy much for the compliments.
"Now is the time for a damn victory," Bieletzki said.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila in the district of Hof, the police are searching for the woman's remains.
On Saturday, volunteers dug up a road near Marxgrün.
To this end, the road covering and several layers of it were removed, as the police and the prosecutor's office jointly announced.
According to new evidence, the missing person may have been buried not far from where she was living at the time.
The woman has been missing since November 4, 1986.
Investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the forensic police in Hof, together with the public prosecutor's office, have again been working intensively on the case, according to the information.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators found a conspicuous underneath the road near Marxgrün using a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, officials limited the site to a few metres.
The results of the excavations should be announced in the course of the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking on the web.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should prefer to use passphrases to secure their accounts on the web.
In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, and it does not hurt to equip computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his impending dismissal as head of the billionaire firm.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed an out-of-court lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla each pay $20 million, and Musk also relinquishes the post of chairman for three years, a position similar to that of the German chairman of the board.
He is allowed to remain on the board of directors.
In the settlement, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager in the US federal court in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads space firm SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was saddened and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange, paying $420 per share, and funding was secured.
That would have valued Tesla at $72 billion in total.
Later, Musk backtracked: Tesla remained on the stock market.
After the deal, Tesla will now have to find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp's team 1-1 at Chelsea FC
Liverpool FC came to a 1-1 draw with Chelsea FC.

Eden Hazard provided the Chelsea lead in the 25th minute with his sixth goal of the season.
After that, the Klopp team missed the equaliser several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger cleared the line after a solo performance by Liverpool goalkeeper Mohamed Salah (31).
Just before the end, Sturridge pulled the Reds into the corner with a sledgehammer.
Record champions Manchester United are slipping deeper and deeper into crisis after their worst start to the season since 1989.
The team of controversial coach José Mourinho lost to West Ham United, earning 1: 3 (0: 2), and remains only in the table midfield with 10 points after seven seasons.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match against Valencia FC.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made his first Premier League appearance after an injury to Petr Cech.
Ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match at 1899 Hoffenheim, Manchester City won 2-0 against Brighton & Hove Albion through goals from Raheem Sterling (29) and Sergio Agüero (65).
Leroy Sané prepared the 1-0, Ilkay Gündogan was not used in the new front-runner.

Polls: 46 percent don't want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
Following the squabbles of the past few weeks, the GroKo has accumulated several survey lows.
The SPD is falling behind the AfD in a poll - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey conducted by the polling institute, the AfD is increasing by one count to 17 per cent, while the SPD is dropping one point compared to the previous week and landing at 16 per cent.
The CDU and CSU are also losing a count, coming in at just 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union so far on Sunday.
The Greens reach 15 per cent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 per cent.
If a Bundestag election were to take place on Sunday, according to Emnid, the governing parties, the SPD, the CDU and the CSU, would receive only 43 percent of the vote.
As a result, the grand coalition has now lost the majority on the Sunday issue at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently get between 43 and 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election, they received a combined 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also wide: The AfD, the second-strongest party in several polls, comes in at 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens have a 12.5 to 17 percent share of the vote.
The left is at an average of 10 percent, while the FDP is at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent upwards and downwards, depending on the share of the vote.
But the popular support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens think Merkel is the right person in the chancellor's office, according to the Emnid poll commissioned by BamS.
According to the poll, only one in two (50 per cent) currently wants the grand coalition to hold until the next regular Bundestag election in three years, and 41 per cent are in favour of a new election.
A further poll released on Saturday also showed a significant drop in popularity for Merkel.
The Germans are also divided on whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 per cent are in favour, while 44 per cent are against.
In the case of supporters of the Union, 64 per cent would like to see a candidate, while 35 per cent would not.
Aldi hanging out: Reduced prices for love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in the times of Tinder, there are no more romantic knowledgeable stories - they should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food data" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket, as a meeting place for the great love, almost radiates an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short bargains at the bowling table or the favorite pudding is still, in doubt, a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being not so much a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We took the test: How do women react, you don't talk about the bush for a long time in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
There is real Hollywood Lovestory potential when the happiness of love is preceded by an out-of-sight, lost-and-found plot.
If the guy goes to his prayers under the e-mail address bio-Putenfleisch @ gmx.de, then that sounds a lot like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Konsorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
For example, the author of this annonce in an Aldi branch, unknown to us, hopes that she will also find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 per cent reduced organic turkey meat."
She has definitely earned her happy end à la Hollywood for believing in the magic of analog acquaintance.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the start of the new school year, the Ludgerischule has been taking part in the campaign "Deckel gegen Polio - 500 Deckel für ein Leben ohne Kinderlähmung."
Polio is the acronym for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polio viruses.
The disease, referred to in German as polio, leads from paralysis to death.
Polio is considered to have been eradicated in Germany, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
So far, the cause of poliomyelitis, the polio viruses, can only be contained by vaccination, according to a press release.
Soccer: Reus and Zorc call for calm for idols
Leverkusen (DPA) - BVB sporting director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to Mario Götze's public discussion on form and fitness.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that's not good for us, "Reus, who is friends with Götze, said after the 4: 2 victory in Leverkusen on the TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Soccer: Eberl: No hurry in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (DPA) - Manager Max Eberl of the German football league Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no hurry in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
So far, we have not even talked about a treaty.
There's no fixed date when we're going to do that.
"However, there will certainly be the moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl told Sky TV on Sunday evening.
Football: District League: Researcher VfL Wolbeck's performance against SC Altenrheine is encouraging
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went hard on the court with his own.
He gave himself up, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, only once (inwardly) withdrew in order to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it is running around the Brandhoveweg again.
Taufrischer proof is the 1: 1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the last season only scratched by the climb.
Yes, I'm very happy with the performance.
'We've tightened the spaces and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen, "Fetsch praised his guys and went to each and every one of them for the game, simply to say" thank you "for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came for him - the 4-4-2 went almost seamlessly over into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes waited in front for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more games in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs in front of him (17th), the alternate Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
It almost smiled when, in minute 41, the SCA struck twice in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the champion of his field.
After the break, the VfL mistakenly took full control.
Thewes, from 18 metres, narrowly failed.
Schroer, too, came too late after 58 minutes in a Thewes innings.
With the addition of Miles Geske, Fetsch once again missed a fresh cell cure on the left side.
When Altenrheiner's Chris Naberbäumer slammed Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free-kick for the Platzherren 18 metres in front of the guest house.
The gunman himself stepped in and demonstrated his dangerousness in terms of standards.
Westhues "Thing with the right slap hit the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1: 0 (71.).
20 minutes to go, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck unhappily flew the leather in the penalty area in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider didn't miss the gift (79).
Wolbeck had to endure a difficult few minutes in the closing stages before Geske still had the winner on the puck in the 87th minute from 12 metres.
Might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt to win 4-1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five days of play - that was not enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to secure their first home victory.
Striker Ante Rebic, who was in the starting line-up for the first time after an injury, should help.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also back after a hamstring injury and, with his head-to-head strength, should prevent the SGE from scoring further goals in line with standards.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
At the time of landing, there was an accident on the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
At around 2pm on Sunday, there was a drama at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
When a helicopter landed, there was turbulence, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The Heli was captured by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a standstill on the side.
Police, rescuers and firefighters were immediately notified.
The emergency services arrived at the scene of the accident on a large scale.
The ÖAMTC emergency medical helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Luckily, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one damage to the property.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to return home on their own.
The exact circumstances surrounding the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of an investigation.
According to fire brigade spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire, which could be quickly extinguished.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on company boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female as of 1 September, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture," which will be officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and presented to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to put themselves in a different position, otherwise the international competitors will move past them," said foundation managing director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, male-only management teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
The gap makes German competitors less diverse, more innovative and more forward-looking.
It's a different corporate culture.
In addition, the small increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies was solely due to positive impulses among the companies in the index of medium-sized values (MDAX).
True, according to Allbright data, only 6.8 percent of board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I'm sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women in the coming year - in their own interests," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement have signalled that they will continue to make no commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
The supervisory boards have a different picture: As of 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"If just as many women were recruited to the boards every year, the proportion would have reached 40 percent by 2023," the report says.
Some even make a mess: Luxury bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserve the best.
The Italians earn 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Whoever makes the most profit per car among the noble suppliers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers pay for each car they sell?
"Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer have dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of €69,000 in the first half of the year with each car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes in at around €800, while Tesla and Bentley are putting a lot of money on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well into the race, with prices averaging between €33,000 and €38,000 per car and around €3,000 in earnings before interest and taxes.
(SDA) On the day of her 38th birthday, tennis legend Martina Hingis announced on Twitter that she was becoming a mother for the first time.
The long-time number one finally ended her career at the end of last year with 25 Grand Slam titles - five in the singles.
In July, she married the Zuger Harald Leemann.
She didn't reveal the date of birth.
Torch train for the opening of the 60th Abtswinder wine festival
The tourist club in Abtswind opened its wine festival session with a torch train.
For the 60th time, the association is organizing the wine festivals, which start every Saturday in October in the large festival tent on Rehweiler Strasse.
At the start of the jubilee, the people in charge moved through the town to the festival square under the sounds of the Wiesenbronn playground.
The chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe, welcomed the guests in the festival tent, which is already full of props. "60 years of doing something like this - this is a fantastic achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that, "Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine princess Lisa II later met the guests symbolically from the stage.
"It's nice that so many people have found their way back to us after the wind." Later, "Die Troglauer" caused a stir.
On Sunday, when the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the club had set the drinks prices on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon, as they did 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival will take place on Friday, 5 October, in the guest's house, before heading into the second round a day later in the festival tent.
In Bonn: Emergency medical car crashes into taxi
An ambulance is heavily damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passer-by was fatally injured in the collision with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they are supposed to help - best of all, save lives.
Such a rescue trip came to a deadly end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in the collision of an emergency car with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had passed a red light with blue lights and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then collided with the taxi, which was driving in green.
The doctor's car smashed into a traffic light and a tree after the collision.
He captured the passer-by, who died at the scene of the accident.
Ambulance driver and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed by emergency services.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian was no longer able to help her.
Another emergency doctor called in tried to do so - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn prosecutor's office, are investigating who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, we're uncomfortable for Mourinho
After a blistering run in the league, Manchester United are now losing in the seventh round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, Manu is 1: 3. The manner of the defeat is likely to give way to talk.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute, in which the reigning Marko Arnautovic scored 3-1 for West Ham, just three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all of Manchester's defensive players stood still, leaving Arnautovic all the time to pass the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative climax of what had previously been a long stretch of insufficient performance.
At the moment, the mood at Uniteds city rivals Manchester City is very different.
The Citizens, trained by Mourinho's great rival Pep Guardiola, came up against Brighton & Hove Albion in an unbeaten 2-0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the outsider's defensive bar for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leaders
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri won a 1-1 draw against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As with the Cup final, Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the closing stages.
Shaqiri, who came onto the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, narrowly missed the equaliser after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better with his Schlenzer in the 89th minute.
So, after the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea couldn't beat for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and with the reins in the league, the Blues also toppled Liverpool from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London City clubs, Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford), celebrated 2-0 victories.
However, fans of the Gunners, who played through Granit Xhaka, had to wait until the 81st minute for a victory against the Hertfordshire County surprise team.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unhappily booked Alex Iwobi into his own goal, and just two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to their fifth consecutive win and are now just behind big rivals Tottenham in fifth place, leaving a strong impression on rising Wolverhampton under their Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten at 2-0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row, finishing eighth.
VW's core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show in the wake of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting should not let go of the German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
From next week, at the 2018 Motor Show, together with competitors from all over the world, they will be showcasing their new products in the French capital.
Diesel doesn't really play a big role in this anymore.
However, the possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, are likely to be an important topic, at least behind the brilliant scenes of the exhibition booths.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is in attendance with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have, among other things, their first pure electric models: The e-tron from Ingolstadt is due to be launched at the end of the year, and the EQC from Stuttgart 2019.
However, both have already been officially presented.
BMW's iNext is not scheduled to launch until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3S.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers, as well as numerous mobility service and software providers, are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which is celebrating its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, more than a million visitors arrived.
The severe earthquakes and subsequent tsunami have killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was hit by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a strength of 5.9, and the second had a strength of 7.4.
Communications and transport links have been damaged, and enormous material damage has been caused.
After the quakes, the tsunami hit the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a celebration.
It is feared that the number of victims will increase significantly.
So far, the figures have only come from Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
Around 150 bikers are celebrating worship in Werdohl
On Sunday, motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is therefore responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) will always take place on the last Sunday of a month at the Nordhelle house.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
On Sunday, around 150 bikers gathered there to celebrate a service that was anything but ordinary.
As early as 10 a.m., the cars were lined up in front of the entrance to the church.
At first, the biker breakfast was on the programme and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake, or even with a solid curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given by Father Dirk Grzegorek during the biker service.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical accompaniment.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill is more poetic and calm," said Father Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein is celebrating a big festival: After the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of the action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused a great deal of interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and showed his amazing spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field for the children and let them fill the apples in the large funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could have imagined how this would turn into a tasty drink.
But they were also able to take a look at this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which look a bit like crockery, layer by layer over each other.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step in the work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the fox farmer also had ready-to-fill specialities.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the older visitors with the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
The parents came into the conversation in a cosy atmosphere, while the children were not only able to follow the process of pressing the apple, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Actives from the foodie comrades of former soldiers also took part in the festival and invited them to play entertaining games at some stations.
The home club will also be offering a day of action next year.
But then, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the subject matter: After all, it will be around the milk.
1: 4 vs. Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season bust: "Scary situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter assembled his disappointed pros from Hannover 96 and gave them courage.
However, there was not much positive to see beforehand in the 1: 4 (0: 2) final of the table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a scary situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler, and he shouted: "That's disappointing, of course, because you always have a lot to do."
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) came to a close, stand at the bottom with two counters and are, in their current constitution, a candidate for relegation.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who, after a successful rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Rome, had seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action by the Hessen on his starting debut and was never able to get a grip on Hanover's defence.
The striker, who has struggled for a long time after the World Cup, showed with his speed and perseverance why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was lent by Liverpool FC, also stood for the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurter, which began in a vibrant manner.
A head ball from Lucas Torró (17th), which was fake on the goal net, brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller, in a promising position at the last minute, was stopped by the 96 defence around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-handed Kevin Wimmer (back).
The lead for the hosts was almost inevitable and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a deflected corner, Haller extending head-to-head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot on.
It was the first Bundesligatreffer for the defender, who came in the summer from the French second division player AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt moved on before the break.
This time, Haller adapted to his storm partner Rebic, who skillfully got through and left 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser with no chance.
At half-time, Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the poor performance of his Elf and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt, two new offensive players.
The Lower Saxony now played a bit more boldly forward, but igniting ideas remained until shortly before the end, when, after all, the follow-up hit was still successful.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then put the ball across to De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only show running for the Frankfurter against overstretched guests, and Jovic also hit one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter, made it to the opening of the 185 in front of a crowd of millions.
Munich Wies'n last week with two blows.
Geisingen: Geisingen Christians celebrate Holy Cross festival
The Geisingen Catholics are celebrating the Holy Cross festival on 14 September or on Sunday afterwards.
The festive service will take place in the town church, followed by a procession to the Church of the Holy Cross with the closing ceremony.
The Church of the Holy Cross is home to the shot Christ, who dates back to the 30-year war and is said to have shot at a Swedish soldier, according to legend.
Blood then flowed from the gunshot wound.
This led to a large pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This has not been completed to this day, only the altar room is standing, the lack of a long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
Despite the importance for the Geisingen parish, the service was poorly attended.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place, and with the closing ceremony, the ecclesiastical part of the feast of the Cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish hall.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farmhouse.
In the afternoon, the parish community offered guided tours around the town church, and Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger, on behalf of the parish, informed visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction work, which will continue into the next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared in more concrete terms.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, as the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but more has also been discovered, which was only made possible by the appearance of the scaffolding.
The pedestal plastering works have been completed, the natural stone works are to be started before the winter, and it is hoped that half of these works will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residential home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life support company Donau-Iller is opening a new residential home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That "a very special house" is now being handed over to its destination in Münsterblickstraße - all those present were in agreement at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users, who have been living in the living room of the Danube-Iller life support centre for some time, are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger spaces and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans began around eight years ago, when the former US Army officer building was put to the test for residents with a mobile phone cap: "The house had come in the years and was no longer up to date with the equipment," explained Bader in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved in to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed to be as friendly and bright as possible, so that residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life support Danube-Iller opens new residential home
Life support invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, while the district of Swabia contributed 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction works have remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money.
The managing director of life support, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and, at the same time, fire-proof construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that allow the residents to experience the freedom to move without the help of others.
The head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said in a similar way: "The house is geared to the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile."
In doing so, the homelessness and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
He added: "The plot in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it can no longer be purchased in the current situation."
In total, the new residential home in Münsterblickstrasse offers space of almost 1500 square metres for 30 people with disabilities, who are divided into three residential groups.
Life support manager Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed on a tariff basis.
Germany: Schwesig complains about differences between East and West
Berlin - Before Unity Day, the deputy SPD chairman, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to all compatriots not to come to terms with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences, "the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania told the" Tagesspiegel am Sonntag. "
The goal must remain to create a level playing field across the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans, on average, worked longer than the people of West Germany, but would receive 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Is this cute dog ending the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is said to be smoothing the woods between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae-in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs a gift.
According to Moon's office on Sunday, the two dogs, who are about a year old, reached their recipient as early as Thursday.
They then passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to "make it easier for the animals to get used to."
The dogs with the thick white coat, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to compete in international sports competitions, such as the 2020 Olympics, and to compete together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
As part of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket engines.
Austria's eventful history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of remembrance, numerous new books have been published, most of which answer this question in retrospect over the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "Picture Book" of Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to work in kind - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the grand coalition, which begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU recently did not mantra the "return to practical work."
This may have led so many craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and physical work, but be it.
If the Federal Government is now ready to rededicate itself to its mission - governance - it should not be prevented from doing so by means of conceptual debates.
Whether the Union and the SPD will actually be able to do something together after the provocations and slurs of the last few weeks will perhaps be revealed on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the ruling parties come together to form a coalition committee.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round on a regular basis in order to defuse conflicts early on; a lesson from all the disputes.
First of all, however, with the diesel retrofitting and the law on the migration of skilled workers, conflict-prone issues are once again on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchanging premiums, while the SPD and CDU see the manufacturers as obliged to retrofit older diesel.
While a rapprochement has emerged over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart on the planned law on the migration of skilled workers.
The SPD is calling for a stay-at-home perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will again be disputes among the coalition partners - and how else should it be?
It is not Gleich and Gleich who have joined forces to form the GroKo, but three partners, some of whom have very different social views and priorities.
Contention is good.
Without a dispute, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests will not move forward.
However, in order to be constructive, quarrels must not be blown up again for party-political reasons on the question of being or not being.
It's still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD should argue - but always keep in mind the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the lane change issue can be solved pragmatically - and thus regained confidence.
Above all, this is what the people's parties now have to fight for.
Mushroom checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the sights
Is the Minister of Labour, of all people, in breach of current service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" her legists had been working on social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of her own two weeks ago.
The statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) comes as a surprise to list mushroom Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via enquiry.
She assumes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team, and in no way to announce violations of current service law in front of cameras."
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to be able to "exonerate Har ­ tinger from any suspicion."
Police tear up a street in search of women's bodies
Marxgrün - Long didn't want the police to comment on this.
Now there is confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug up.
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It follows that the investigators had previously set up an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with its guide, was finally able to limit the relevant area to a few metres in repeated use.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian monument protection authority, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said road section.
For more than a year, the public prosecutor's office and the forensic police have been handling the missing persons case.
Time and again, a bike path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because investigators suspect that Heike's body may have been buried here as part of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of Catalonia's controversial independence referendum.
But there have been riots before.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - On the eve of the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and police broke out in the center of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence protesters with paint powder, among other things, in an attempt to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to use a rally to pay tribute to their colleagues who were deployed in the polling stations last year in what was considered an illegal referendum.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence at the time.
Catalan police have formed a chain to keep the separatist and central state security forces' demonstrations separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the 6,000 or so separatists would have attempted to break through the police chain by force, throwing paint bags and eggs at the officers, among other things.
Six people have been arrested and 24 others have been slightly injured, the authorities said.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the affluent region of Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians have also moved abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, are still in custody.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was brought to an end.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Soccer: Oberliga Westfalen: Assembled helplessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen are torn apart
Red-and-white Ahlen continues to stand on the spot.
At FC Gütersloh, too, it was only enough for a 0-0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewald stadium, the final light and the third final turned out to be an assembled helplessness.
The first half was vaguely manageable by the entertainment factor.
If you wanted to get a beer or a sausage, you could do so without worry.
There was no risk of missing a goal chance, because there were virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The Ahlens had the best - and in principle the only real - chance when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling into a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty line.
The hosts were even more innocuous.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schroeder had to be replaced due to injury, and Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel scored just over the box from 18 metres and, after an hour, the Gütersloher also made an offensive appearance for the first time.
After the shooting of Matthäus Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
Nick Flock (62) "crowned" the fast-paced counter over Sinan Aygün with a lacklustre shot into the arms of goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also followed up with a headball from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
Interim head coach Angelo Daut reacted by bringing in Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60) and, a little later, Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70).
It didn't work - nothing.
The Ahlens did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it didn't make any difference either.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like the fact that we played to zero." But unfortunately, the zero also stood at the front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent didn't want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, "it all sounded like a bit" against a team "that just wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel we could get the opposite, "Daut said.
To his dismay, however, viewers didn't feel as if his team could score a goal.
The idea was too feeble for that.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Luckily, there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld table issue centre, for which these donations are intended, are delighted.
The volunteers assure: "These donations will also remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the place was still a bit empty, but that was to change during the day.
Because: "It's so nice to be sociable here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organiser of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus greeted the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit, as always, with a decent pinch of humour.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed up against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has fallen ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" couldn't help but entertain the ever-increasing number of visitors in between.
This was so good that a few folk songs were sung late in the evening.
"Just great," rejoiced Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to put the opening date on his schedule this time around.
He is pleased about the many active players with their stands, among them predominantly clubs.
"Actually, there shouldn't be such a thing as a table," he thanked the men's choir for their action.
Andreas Hajek praised the dedication of all those who worked at the stands and also included the other festivals that took place in September and the "Clean Up" campaign.
Our garden town has a colourful painting - here's what's going on.
The May wreath was then taken away by Georg Knorr and Gerd KGlück, with the help of the fire brigade, and taken to the winter quarters.
Work was carried out on many booths for the bodily well-being.
From sweet to hearty, everything was to be had.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative with his decorative saw.
He offered veneer work, beer lid with Reckenfeld motifs and a lot more.
Three beekeepers offered a specialty: "Reckenfelder Honig," brought along by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter still has a speciality.
Honey cake in the glass, of course, with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access again and again, and the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that allowed visitors to linger long into the evening hours, even without a stage programme that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubricants with local political message: No successful advertisement for skateboarding
In Lengerich, unknown people have advertised for the construction of a skate system in a way that is hardly helpful.
There are corresponding lubricants in several places, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" Are emblazoned on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering has already been discovered on the advertising sign at the stairway to the Gempt bistro after the trade fair on 19 September.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an edding at the time, it could have been removed without any problems.
"A few days later, however, it was back, this time sprayed," Rottmann said.
He assumes that the corresponding advertisement will have to be replaced.
A special note is given to this particular case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate system is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
Promises have already been made, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of schools, sport and culture, without naming names.
However, it is quite possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the lubricated board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skateboarding.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
In the end, the majority of the Council voted in favour of the firefighter's parking lot.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against construction at this point.
A U-turn followed at the end of June.
The members of the main and financial committee have now voted unanimously in favour of the area of the Gutenberg school.
Jürgen Kohne says on the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the midst of concrete planning.
The city council will then have the final say.
He expects a decision to be made this year, so if the vote is positive, it could be built in 2019.
Air traffic control bottleneck gets worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"We've had wind this year, we're going to have strong winds in 2019 and then the storm comes," Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control union, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known shortage of staff in European air traffic control systems, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Across Europe, the market for fully trained pilots has been swept away.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, to monitor the upper German airspace, around a hundred people were missing.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives from the federal government, the states, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic city on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, you won't be able to do it without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the state-owned German air traffic control company.
Maas once again blamed the European Commission for the pilots' plight.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting cost targets and staff savings for national air traffic control systems are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to push for regulations in Brussels that "do not further cut off the air" for air traffic controllers.
At the moment, the EU's requirements would be agreed by 2024, and there are fears of further tightening.
The EU is under constant pressure from airlines to lobby.
"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He said he hoped the high cost of delays for airlines would lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German air traffic control agency (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," Maas said.
The so far announced admission of 120 pilots per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary personnel build-up is not yet connected with this.
ThyssenKrupp supervisory board votes in favour of group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans for the restructuring of the group.
According to Thyssenkrupp interim chief executive Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at Sunday's meeting, the struggling group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies will be based in Essen and will be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff cuts beyond the already well-known cuts in the administration.
After two resignations, the control board has only eight heads on the capital side.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business will be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demos of policemen and Catalan independence supporters.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona have seen violent clashes with many injured.
According to the city council, around 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as around 6,000 pro-independence protesters.
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other by means of a large-scale operation.
However, according to the force, pro-independence activists repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They had attacked the officers with paint and throwing bullets.
According to the information, there were also feuds between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescuers, 24 people were injured.
Police said there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and esteem for colleagues
With their demonstration, the policemen wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who, almost exactly a year ago, had taken action against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they were demanding better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Civil Guard feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn far more than they do.
The protesters saw it as a provocation that the Spanish policemen were demonstrating in Barcelona, of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez asked the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drove us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who only did their duty last year: To defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we're doing it in Barcelona because it's a big European city and there's more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues "didn't come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Scam allowed access to personal data of UK ministers
A security flaw in a mobile app has resulted in the personal data of ministers and MPs from Britain's Conservative Tory party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the scam was announced a day before the Tory party conference in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hanover police reported a serious traffic accident on Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently in flames.
The volunteers are on site.
The article will be updated on an ongoing basis.
Soccer: Juve coach praises after top match: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best match this evening along with the half-hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champion's 3-1 (1-1) victory against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive star, even without his own goal, was the decisive man in the important match against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo has had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we've grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game around after the early slip through the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and, for the time being, suspended the most annoying striker.
The Real Madrid goalkeeper first put on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26-49).
And Ronaldo, after a corner with a headball, also did the preliminary work on the hit of defensive head coach Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who only had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," praised the coach.
But Allegri, of course, also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We've got to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve goalscorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on his account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to be becoming even more overwhelming.
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in the Serie A. With 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six points ahead of Naples.
The second in the table, trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the record of Mario Rui (58.), who had already been warned, the lead was decided.
The Portuguese had to get off the pitch after getting too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
"We played well against a good Naples," said the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also able to feel addressed.
The German national player has won over Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool FC, has played in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said was "half an hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the Turin 2-0 win and was blocked for Tuesday's home game against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly bizarre performance, Rapper Kanye West has attracted attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" over the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided the spectators with headlights and question marks.
The 41-year-old also announced a name change in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, let's just call him "Ye," according to the musician.
"The character who used to be known as Kanye West," he tweeted, referring to the late singer Prince, when he dropped his artist name.
However, the pseudonym is not news.
The tenth album has already been released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think" Ye "is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and that's where it means" you, "" the rapper said.
Soccer: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar's coach, Averhage, made no secret of his disappointment.
It was a poor game for us today.
The opponent was simply more hands-on, we almost never confronted him with any problems. "Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar's shooting options reads thin.
Score two goals in 90 minutes, so it is rarely possible to make games positive.
A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two opportunities in the first round, but the first, Maik Krause, from a sharp angle, took advantage of the early lead (7.).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have elevated Uphus, but after great preliminary work by Krause, he scored freely.
The hosts only had a double chance when Moritz Höne first failed to score Jos Schuhmacher and also found his champion in the Sendenhorster Keeper after Jan Blome's shot.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61) and Heinz Linnemann (69) all gave up.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and looked red for it - Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use it for the guests (75.).
It was only when Nils Berheide knocked the ball over the line that the game was decided (81).
"We had criticized each other harshly before, and that was different today than in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0: 1 Krause (7.), 0: 2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75th / Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in nightmares: GW Albersloh defeated Concordia 3: 4
"I don't know what to think of it," he said.
"We didn't get any access to them at all." With that, he presumably meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green whites, who came up with a collective offensive drive.
He was still able to laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winking cheekily and pulling away from his players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, nightmares, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for class.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best performance of the season," he said.
"How we come back after the 0-2, how we play against one of the top teams in the league all the time, that was really phenomenal."
This makes it all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two balls in that game for that goal.
He set the 2-0 lead over the left-hand side for Fabian Fröhning (39).
We knew that, but you can't take such a player out completely.
"That was madness, what he did," Lewandowski adamantly acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own Elf got the balance right: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long Toreck (45).
After the change of side, it was again McGill who scored the equaliser (59).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked nightmares again (64th), just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalised (69th).
Despite the overcrowding, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80).
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we've got to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1-0 Zymner (24th), 2-0 Fröhning (39th), 2-1 McGill (45th), 2-2 McGill (59th), 3-2 Nübel (64th), 3-3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4-3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74th / nightmares).
Soccer: TSV Straßberg scores point against Primus
There was no winner in the national league duel between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually travelled for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0-0.
Media: Entire Presidium of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire bureau of second-division football player Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
Several media outlets agreed on a joint letter from the Saxony committee in the evening.
At first, there was no confirmation from the club.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles with the former Bundesligisten.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
It's good that he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany brings as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many thought he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offerings
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing is offering around 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he wants to pick up the tolerance prize in person in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, his term of office was too short: As Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
For example, academy director Udo Hahn credited him with saying proudly: "All the Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellor have already been with us." However, the fact that celebrities repeatedly appear at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic during the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective; on 29 September, writer Frido Mann will attend a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised that he will personally accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category will also be awarded to TV presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The 80 or so meetings up to mid-2019 have it in their own right.
"The pension is not safe!" Is the title of the conference.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - this is how the academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting on Syria:" Barbarism Without Limit. "
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war mocks every humane idea. "
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society, to the gap between rich and poor, to the radical change in work through digitisation.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions, or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting on the 200th.
Karl Marx's birthday soon awaits one more visitor to the direction of critique of capitalism, the other more of a tendency "from the left to the centre."
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 per cent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 per cent neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender Understanding With Heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner imagined gender understanding, not only with humour and heart warmth for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man, and what else might exist, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp was sitting on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes up with words until the end of the sentence, and on the other hand, a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner is so congenially harmoniously accompanied that some people may have wanted a solo.
That was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, as it suited the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: The satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but he does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.
The piano solo is now demonstrating something of its own: What would have come out of Mozart's composing if "the Nannerl" had opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus Süverkrüp slips over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Song of Death," and from Mozart's G minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was a lot of applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Flowers were handed over to Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, the chancellor.
But chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck didn't let an additional thank you go.
She had the idea to give the duo one in Wolbeck, in addition to appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

The background is Musk's surprise announcement in August that he would take Tesla off the stock market.
In its lawsuit, the SEC accused Musk of providing false and misleading information.

Following a bus crash on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have slightly revised down the number of victims.
10 passengers, instead of 15, were slightly injured.
All of them have since been released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in hospital for one night for observation.
He will be released later in the day, a police spokesman said.
The cause of the crash of the long-distance bus at Bruchsal is still unclear.
On Saturday morning, the long-distance bus crashed head-on against a ladder.
Handball: Women's national league: Ahlener SG narrowly retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlenerinnen had problems above all with the third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone scored ten hits.
"I was really happy with the defence, only one player has scored too many goals.
We didn't get to grips with them, "ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu said.
However, he was more annoyed by the many missed opportunities.
His team missed out on the concentric finish this time around.
As a result, the ASG was lagging behind almost until the end, lying behind at the break at 11: 12 and later at 15: 18 (45.).
It was only towards the end that the wider bank of the hosts made a decisive impact.
In addition, Aydogdu put back-room Merle Klement on the left-hand side, which then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5 / 3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd women's league: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top-of-the-line match at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the third league West.
The blue-white team won 3-1 at the second-league descendant VC Allbau Essen.
"This was a huge step forward for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
That is what we have now worked out, "said coach Dominik Münch, delighted after an almost impeccable performance by his team at the toppled championship leader.
The guests dominated the first round almost at will.
Over 4: 1, 16: 10 and 22: 12, he went to the vice-champion of the previous year at 25: 15.
Essen took over in the two-man bar, but didn't get into the game.
We've done a good job of it.
Our opponent has taken a high risk, but has also produced a number of tickets.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12: 8. "Essen has switched the assumption to three bars.
We couldn't keep up the pressure.
Food has sucked in, and we have let ourselves be lulled in a bit, "Münch continued.
At 18: 17, for the first time, the volleyball players from the Ruhr region had their noses in the foreground.
At 19: 24, Ostbevern still fought off four sets of balls, but the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," said the practice manager at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and, finally, Wiebke Silge made a significant contribution to the BSV turning the page in the third section from 14: 16 to 25: 21.
Münch: "We played consistently and quietly."
Over 7: 3 and 15: 13, the blue-and-white passage brought four with 25: 22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish municipality: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the manner in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the large Ditib mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a hole in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be brought together with difficulty," said the chairman of TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, to the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and German sides have missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of emphasizing the Muslims' affiliation to Germany side by side with German leaders, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The far-reaching exclusion of the German public has "reinforced many reservations."
Nottuln home club: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break, Folktreff is finally back.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 pm, the Nottuln home club is already holding its fifth Nottuln Folktreff in the chimney room of the Old Officials.
Almost exactly on the day, it was a year ago that we had a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln, "said Hanns Moormann, chairman of Nottuln's home club.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk meeting would take place so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether it was Storm Friederike in January or the heatwave in July, the official's fireplace room was always full.
"As always, the programme at the next Folktreff is a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and seaman songs, folk songs, evergreens and old drums," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has promised his accordion for the first follow-up "birthday."
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling," a group from the neighboring district of Steinfurt, which played music with German-language texts.
Now he's on the road with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff are happy to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten, with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night," enthused the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many cheerful guests to once again spend a convivial and humorous evening," says the invitation from the home club.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to play an active role is invited to take part.
As the coveted seats are always quickly occupied, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 pm, but the entrance is already at 7 pm.
China approves proposed merger between Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on their way to becoming the world's largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
As a result, approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the United States are still pending for the multi-billion dollar merger.
Most recently, according to an insider, the chances of approval there had improved because Linde had promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit farming to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125-year anniversary of the district association for horticulture and regional care was celebrated.
On 29 September 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impulses were set up for the Kulmbach district association for horticulture and regional care, and exactly 125 years later, he celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, at the time he was still called different: As the "district sobbing association Kulmbach Stadt und Land," he was baptized by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - in fact, it was purely about fruit-growing, and no one thought about flowers and horticulture at the time.
"At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favourite child of the elites," explained district pastor Günter Dippold in his keynote speech.
Fruit trees should be lined with trunk roads, and so-called industrial gardens have been set up in schools.
Fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition all play an important role, as do knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwerfen" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are on the stage in an entertaining way.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The collection of chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can get a similar amount of joy with your smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with District Councillor Klaus Peter Söllner to mark the anniversary.
"The district council decides where they should stand," added Söllner, highlighting the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, the beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district left no doubt about this, even district manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the district association with a lecture and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, and it was docked for the winter.
By the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden had turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has persisted, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves towards it," said the expert for fruit and nut trees.
For this reason, there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up, so that our homeland remains beautiful and liveable.
This includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian State Association.
"We must stop the glaring decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif, the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the towers of the Thurnau Music Association.
Daniel Huber won summer GP in Hinzenbach
The Salzburger won with 245.7 points, well ahead of Peier and Geiger.
Daniel Huber secured a home victory at the summer Grand Prix of ski jumpers in Hinzenbach on Sunday.
The Salzburger won with 245.7 points, ahead of the Swiss Kilian Peier (237.7) and the German Karl Geiger (237.3).
World Cup record winner Gregor Schlierenzauer (236.2) narrowly finished fifth behind Russian overall leader Yevgeny Klimov (236.3).
Clemens Aigner (7th) and Michael Hayböck (9th) also finished in the top ten.

Priority for Nafta talks: Canada's foreign minister postpones UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: They are giving both trading partners an ultimatum to reach an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister is now giving absolute priority to the trade deal - and postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York due to the pressure of time in the struggle to relaunch the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will not address the United Nations General Assembly until Monday, her spokesman, Adam Austen, said.
In the meantime, she is focusing on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that negotiators from Canada and the United States have 48 hours to agree if Canada really wants to join the trade deal already struck between its country and the United States.
The US and Mexico agreed in August to revamp the Nafta regional free trade agreement.
Us President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks on a new edition have been going on for more than a year.
They are now scheduled to be completed by Sunday evening (local time), and Trump's administration plans to submit the deal to the U.S. Senate before October 1.
In the event of a breakdown in negotiations, Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.
These are the most dangerous roads in Hanover.
The accident atlas of the Federal Statistical Office shows all the collisions of 2017 with the injured and killed in Hanover.
The most dangerous crossing, therefore, is the Königsworther Platz.
The city and ADFC want to use the data to make the roads safer.
Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo."
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country last week ahead of the presidential election.
The politician was attacked on an open street during a campaign rally in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations, in particular, had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations against Bolsonaro made racist and disrespectful statements.
Several thousand protesters were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mingled with a rally by Brazilian Workers' Party (PT) presidential candidate Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to stand.
Brazil's presidential election is on October 7.
As the ex-mayor of the millionaire city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reaches an absolute majority in the first round of voting, there will be a runoff on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from it successfully - no matter who he opposes.
Bolsonaro is known for rallying against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Time and again, he is shocked by verbal derision.
Another time, he said the supporters of Lula's left-wing Workers' Party should be shot.
Europe reclaim Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Only an hour away from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairytale at the gates of Paris.
In front of more than 150,000 spectators on the three days at Le Golf National, captain Thomas Björn's outsider team dethroned the favourite defending champion USA for a toothless Tiger Woods with great strokes and outstanding team spirit.
After a long illness: Danish rock legend has died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen told Larsen's website.
On his death bed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen became well-known with the band Gasolin, which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music stars such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album, "MIDT om natten," is the best-selling album in Denmark to date.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts."
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy's opponent, Larsen, had appeared on the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rocknacht in the shoe factory: Volume at the pneumatic level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a rewrite of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure of three bands who are friends with each other.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - are visibly enthusiastic about the 120 or so visitors to the "Mint Mosquito" rock night with their bands.
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika already knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, during the performance, the band will be danced together in a harmonious and powerful manner.
Although "encore" calls are not to be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" will then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand."
The fact that Hardrock is not the same as Hardrock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and Drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock from the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers," in addition to the guitar rock, "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer.
Not only the yearning, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" captivates by switching from melodic passages to the guitar-clad rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, however, has gained a special reputation since it was founded in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will be showcasing their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has a special stage experience with its performances in front of a large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - is obvious and unmistakable.
In conjunction with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents in the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up," by cameo from the 80s.
At the same time, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a cheerful solo with an even higher sound than before, and he runs through the audience.
A certain volume is, of course, part of the reason for this kind of Hardrock concert: At the "Mint Mosquito" - Rocknacht, according to information from the mixing desk team, the three-part concert of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of the press chamber, but it is still significantly below the levels of the "Wacken Festival," which "The Ignition" refers to on its website.
Deafening 120 decibels in nozzle thickness, as is customary for the annual Metal-Stelldichein in the north of the republic, however, the Ahlener audience does not need this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harsher, rocky gait have long been convinced by their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say at the end, of course in a figurative sense.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in glider crash at Essen / Mülheim Airport
There was a fatal accident at the Mülheim / Essen airport.
A glider crashed in a parking lot at the Mülheim / Essen airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near the Mülheim / Essen airport on Sunday.
As reported by the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung," a glider had crashed in the exhibition parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, the flight pupil was on board alone - the plane is said to be a one-seater.
The plane had already landed at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just a short distance away from a tent on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
Mülheim / Essen Airport is located on the borderline of the two Ruhr district towns and directly on the driveway to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot, there is a Park & Ride offer at major events in the Essen trade fair or the Gruga hall in Essen.
Trump hugs Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that North Korea's leader, Kim, is well-versed in the face of a nuclear crisis.
Now, however, Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has declared himself to be a new flame.
The tragic thing is that it's a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tense words for the half-old sprout of Pyongyang's ruling dynasty, even though it turns out to be a rather tough chunk in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, he was too, and it went back and forth between us," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And it wasn't just the talks with Kim that caused his heart to melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump has pointed to Kim's announcement of a halt to all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service to them.
The US president seemed to be well aware that the affection for the notorious "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - was not for everyone.
In any case, he immediately anticipated the expected criticism of it when he appeared in a large sports hall in the town of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they've fallen in love."
How horrible, how horrible is that?
It's so unpresidential.
But he didn't care much, Trump explained, and then pointed his finger at the crowd: "I've always told you it's so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there squeezing into this crowded arena, we'd only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler is well-attended, atmospheric and, on top of that, full of sunshine: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city centre got dressed up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest did not just take place in the festival tent at the fire brigade tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan jail thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to point out their dire conditions in Libya, allowing them to be rescued.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July and distributed it online.
"They refuse to send us back," one man said in the video message.
We're suffering here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the France 24 Observers website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who captured the video, told AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while attempting to cross the Mediterranean into Europe.
According to his own statement, he put himself in danger of life with the video.
One of his companions was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM is organising the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been returned to their homes this year with the help of the program, IOM spokesman in the West African country Jorge Galindo said.
The case of the Nigerians, who have now been rescued, is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions in Libya.
However, he has not yet heard of a call for help via mobile phone video.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the local elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At around 4: 50 p.m., the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the front of the first floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher agreed with the police, who have begun the investigation.
It is not yet possible to say whether items or money have been stolen.
Description of the perpetrator: About 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the Obernberg Police Inspectorate at the Inn, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old man has had to endure several days and nights in his car in a woodland area in central Franconia after he stuck the car away from all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers discovered the car on Saturday afternoon accidentally near a pasture and freed the person who had been missing since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
According to the information, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he failed to return from a ride with his off-road car over the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive searches, the man's whereabouts remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls for the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU), in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has called for the rule of law in Turkey.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This concerns above all the waves of arrests, the press and religious freedom.
He therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, then the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this."
Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans who are in jail in Turkey, according to his own statements.
He said he expected freedom of expression to be respected.
As a result, Erdogan once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's readiness to fly at Cologne Airport at short notice.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the owners of the castle had rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their point of contact - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of trust in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of emphasizing the success of negotiations on North Korea's denuclearization, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for Washington to be accommodated.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has accused the U.S. government at the U.N. General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The latest stalemate comes as the US is relying on coercive measures that are deadly to building confidence," Ri said in New York.
In these circumstances, disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
That punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" is "a pipe dream of people who don't know us."
However, in order to build confidence, his country has halted its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri stressed.
However, there was no "corresponding reaction" from the US side, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, the U.N. Security Council had imposed sanctions on the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
Us President Donald Trump and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, have been pushing for strict compliance with sanctions at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working towards a rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The Hot served: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors to the open-door house Hot got nothing of it: White blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the harvest tank service.
The youngsters of the Hot had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the municipality, for which the young people wanted to thank them for their food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the Hot, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then, on the first day after the summer break, the bad surprise came: A blackout had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of service, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from scratch: We got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and teenagers wanted to do it on their own," said Westbuer.
And that's how everyone got on with it.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"Cooks can't do it better either," praised one visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use Quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," stressed Father Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen was amazed with card tricks and other pieces of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves North Rhine-Westphalia State Board of Directors
Out of frustration with criticism from within his own ranks, the head of the Essen board, Jörg Sartor, has quit his post in the regional association.
Sartor had become well-known nationwide because the Essen tablet had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned as deputy head of the NRW board in July, Sartor told the "Welt am Sonntag."
I've got too many in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, expressed his sympathy to the DPA for the decision of his long-standing deputy.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his move - there were people who didn't know exactly why the Essen board was doing it."
However, Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes," said Weilerswist.
In "Welt am Sonntag," Sartor once again criticized colleagues from other panels.
You shouldn't take the approach of "without us, the people of the city are starving."
It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people do not die of starvation.
The Essener did not take part in a congress of the panels in Berlin on Friday.
"I'm told there's too much sweetness," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis, who criticized me so much at the time.
SF Lorch to play 2-0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Soccer, district league Lorch loses to newcomers 2: 3 - TV hypocrites win in Kirchheim after lag - Bettringen beat Lauchheim clear.
With 2: 0, Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV newcomer - in the end it was 2: 3 and the disappointment among the sports enthusiasts was great.
The TV hypocrites are quite different: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0: 1, but after 90 minutes it won with 2: 1. Meanwhile, at the top of the table, the SGB was able to score 3: 0.
Gladbach misses two-time lead - Schalke without Embolo with first win
Borussia Mönchengladbach will have to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2: 2, the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke scored their first win of the season against Mainz (1: 0).
(SDA) four times in the first five league games, Schalke have been sidelined with early opponents.
Now Domenico Tedesco's team have once again shown the strength with which they took first place behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home squad in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Yevgeny Konoplyanka, and the hosts then conserved the mini-pad with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund are relegated from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had scored a 0-2 draw against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but still came to a 4-2 victory in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalised with a Doublette inside four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, scored with another Doublette in the closing stages (86th / 94th) for the crowning finish of the performance increase after the break.
The first victory was also won by the VfB Stuttgart.
Against Werder Bremen, who had already been decimated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, the Stuttgart riders had to worry in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler produced a curious throw-in goal that helped the guests balance in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to its first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang didn't make a fully successful debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
Gladbacher, who has competed with Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave up a lead twice, eventually playing 2-2 and still waiting for an away win in VW City since 2003.
Renato Steffen, with his second Bundesligator, was responsible for Wolfsburg's 1-1 balance.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the flat shot from 20 metres of the Aargau, as was the second opponent after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite devastating.
Alassane Pléa turns out to be a Goalgetter in the storm of foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase, which came from the OGC Nice, hit for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh mandatory game.
After seven laps, Gladbach finished fourth.
Within 40 minutes, the previously undefeated Werder Bremen maneuvered against the VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt's team were surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first goal of the season, and after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to play for his team: The 23-year-old Serbe scored yellow-red after a hat-trick against Daniel Didavi.
To be sure, Stuttgart defenseman Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Brewers back into the game with a curious throw-in goal (68th), and a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the overwhelmingly active Stuttgart back onto the winning streak.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3: 0 on their own.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens put the home team on track with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state name
In Macedonia today, around 1.8 million citizens are voting on whether to change their country's name in North Macedonia.
With a yes vote, the nearly three-decade-old conflict with neighbor Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name, blocking any rapprochement between Macedonia and the West.
As a result, voters will also decide on the future of Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a Nato member in the event of a positive outcome to the referendum.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
One Syrian brutally beaten three retired women and, as a result, seriously injured them.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rushed to Alsergrund on Friday at around 10pm.
When the policemen arrived, they addressed the accused, who walked out on passers-by with his fists and tried to attack them, about his behaviour.
As a result, the Syrian tried to beat and kick the officers.
A short time later, it emerged that the suspect had beaten three elderly women (65, 67, 75) to the ground with his fists at a tram stop in Währinger Strasse shortly before.
He had also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the retirees were seriously injured.
They suffered haematoma, bruises and concussion.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for an unknown reason," according to police.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two of them gave themselves the go-ahead.
Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper that a registered partnership was not in question for her.
"When we get married, it's the right thing to do." He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer district, the conservative SPD wing.
On June 30, 2017, Kahrs caused a stir in the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals.
For example, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexual couples.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the right to adopt.
Garden day: 400 metres of hedgehogs cut
There was a lot of work going on in front of the members of the Children's Association and the Society for Leprosy.
This is because around 400 metres of hedge around the gardens of the residents of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for around 12 supporters.
"We are doing this in order to reduce costs," said the chairman of the citizens' association, Walter Schröer.
And it has accumulated so much.
Due to the hot summer, we're late this time, but luckily it's just a form cut.
Because already in the spring, the hedgehogs have already been shaken.
The breakfast, which always follows the work, also has a long tradition.
"After all, everyone should keep up their efforts," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner takes gold at the Canoe Slalom World Cup
Augsburg's Hannes Aigner has won the gold medal at the end of the Canoe Slalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, I've already had enough rides here on the track and it all worked out today, "said the London 2012 Olympic third.
In the finish, he threw away his paddle with joy and stretched both arms in a victorious manner - knowing full well that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had race number four.
But the six remaining starters couldn't topple his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech Jiri Prskavec was second in front of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
Police inspector Gauting reported the first attempt to break into a single-family home this autumn.
Luckily, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to take advantage of.
Yesterday, the Gauting Police Inspectorate reported the first attempt at burglary this autumn.
The alarm system is due to the fact that it stayed at the single-family house on Königswieser Straße.
After all, it started when the perpetrators put their hands on it shortly before 8 p.m. on Friday.
The intruders suspected that the residents were not at home.
However, the alarm system apparently surprised her so much that she took the flight without prey.
Notes to PI Gauting, Phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Hertha bust: Caught up in reality: Bayern vs. Ajax called for
The title is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin "does not want to please" FC Bayern.
The next two classics, against Ajax and Gladbach, will now determine the first interim fixture for Niko Kovac's tenure.
The first small performance model under the new coach, Niko Kovac, should by no means increase to the greater autumn low for the Munich team.
"A week ago, we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a bit of reality has caught up with us, "said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are giving gas in the direction of Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal of its own has been scored, as at the same time in the pre-season, two mandatory games in series without victory, the lead in the Bundesliga for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
While the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record-breaking champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at the 1: 1 with its noisy man-against-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitches over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, just as the recently overpowered Bayern are to be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not let this happen and we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again," stressed Kovac.
Apart from that, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his birthplace, and only blamed his first defeat as Munich coach on the once again poor handling of chances.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interval of his tenure a positive one before the break - otherwise the tone is likely to get worse.
For example, Kovac did not take any exceptional measures ahead of this season's second royal class appearance after the 2-0 draw at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round match against Ajax, which had also triumphantly defeated AEK Athens 3-0 at the start, will begin.
"Now we've caught up in two games, but we're going to do our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As was the case after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich, in particular, spoke plainly.
The right-wing defender took on the role of Mahner.
"I don't think it's all bad luck, we have to work it out again because we don't make the multitude of chances and we make the mistakes behind," said the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bayern were already five points behind Dortmund, who have now taken the lead again with a point advantage.
And so Kimmich, with a twinkle in his eye, was at least positive that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's a good thing," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in firing line: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
A new post is now to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the power of interpretation in the long-term issue of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticised the treatment of the ex-world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the head of the DFB defended the association line.
In the early hours of Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the Causa in the ZDF "Sportstudio" in Mainz.
"In the future - because we also have a lot of players with a migrant background in the U-teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that something like this will not happen again," said the 57-year-old, who wants to win a national player without a migrant background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had vehemently denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil, who was born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they have been photographed with me in England, "Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral town.
Honestly, as their president, I couldn't digest the fact that our two young men, who went up to the German national team, were sidelined.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt "treated sensibly by the DFB."
At the same time, he announced his intention to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - that's not possible.
"I'm very sorry that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I've always said.
However, he does not see any basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a result, an additional integration officer will now be appointed alongside Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says," The issue is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Despite criticism of him after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run for the post of DFB president again next year.
"I'm doing my job and I'm trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg / Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10am and 1pm.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no exchange of people, as the 75-year-old was unable to find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had come off the road and driven against a ladder.
Asked about this, the man did not want police on the spot and then drove away.
After that, the Roman painter drove home.
However, the pensioner went to his home, where he has lived for decades, and rammed a construction vehicle when he turned around.
Finally, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car suffered significant damage to the accident.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and couldn't remember much more.
The damage amounts to around 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 volunteers are still in use.
Around four weeks after the eruption of the moorfire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 volunteers are still working on the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop in a stable manner, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of troops is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire was discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster was lifted, which was declared just over a week earlier on 21 September, because it was feared that the flames would put adjacent forests and settlements at risk through wind and spark flights.
On Thursday, it was said that an attack on adjacent communities would no longer be a threat.
At times, more than 1,500 volunteers tried to get the large fire under control on the ground.
The Luftwaffe is continuing to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones from the German Armed Forces.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "tornadoes" are also planned for 2 and 5 October.
The fire was sparked by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrands had occasionally moved up to a hundred kilometers over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr plans to set up a point of contact to receive claims.
Initial claims for compensation had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Nearly one year after the marriage came into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two of them gave themselves the go-ahead.
Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper that a registered partnership was not in question for her.
When we get married, it's the right thing to do.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer district, the conservative SPD wing.
On June 30, 2017, Kahrs caused a stir in the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals.
For example, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexual couples.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the right to adopt.
Macedonian referendum on new state names started
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is what the neighbour Greece insists on because of its northern province of the same name.
As a bargaining chip, Athens had for almost three decades blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and Nato.
If the citizens vote "yes," they will also give the starting signal for the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from oblivion
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have been 90 years old on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize laureate died in the US in 2016, leaving behind a work that preserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is designed to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
(DPA) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved by Swisstransplant in case of need.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
It is believed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five per cent of cases will a card be found at a crucial moment in the case of potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very stressful," says Immer.
A similar registration system is already in place in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible donation of organs on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman for the Federal Centre for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"There is no register where people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation on organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or she disagreed.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old pupil is world champion in headcount
Tomohiro Iseda, a 14-year-old pupil from Japan, is the world champion in headcount.
He competed against 39 riders in Wolfsburg at the weekend.
Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue for the competition, announced this on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany finished third.
The youngest participant in the World Cup was a 12-year-old Japanese pupil, the oldest being a 74-year-old retiree from France, chief judge Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau, Saxony, organises the competition every two years.
Previous tasks, for example, were: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, in which participants competed against guests from the audience with pocket calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was already present in Bielefeld two years ago, when he was 14 years old at the time.
Organiser Laue has little to do with terms such as superbrain, genius or miracle child.
"Headcount can be trained," he said.
Many participants practised several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-oriented arithmetic competitions.
One of the disciplines, for example, is the square root drawing of six-digit numbers.
When it comes to versatility, candidates are given surprise tasks, for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans would also have a good chance here, said the chief judge.
Otherwise, Asians are often at an advantage, because headcount is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods, even in early childhood.
Powerful appeal: Video featuring naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer screening
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows off her compassionate and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer and make a strong case for early detection.
It's about life and death, but it's also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate parts.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett has died.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which focuses on breast cancer screening that can save lives.
Serena Williams herself would have died almost a year ago.
There were complications with the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia.
An emergency surgery has been launched to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were then discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government is planning to significantly expand the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "Symbols Act" in review.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Ms Holle is shaking her beds in the west for the first time next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists from the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to between 1,500 and 1,200 metres at the start of the week - in narrow valleys, it could snow down to around 1,000 metres at high intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of new snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher passageways (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße), the road conditions are therefore winter.
Farmers will be allowed to start their annual knee care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers will be allowed to start their annual knee care on Monday.
The "green walls," which are unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the wooded state for around 200 years.
The tree and shrubs, which are up to five metres wide, are "forest replacement" and, for many animals and plants, the last retreat areas.
Knicks are connecting habitats scattered as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still work, said Ingo Ludwichowski, managing director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of an order from the King of Denmark, Christian VI, in 1766, which ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and cattle fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also dates back to that time: By "bending" the branches, the dense, intertwined demarcations were able to develop.
Today, around 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a wooden, multi-layered landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now being used as a replacement habitat by around 7,000 animal species.
Up to 1800 different species could live within one kilometre of Knick and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the Knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly cared for in the winter.
Otherwise, it will become a light line of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, will also lose the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, knee care can only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesians talk about situation on the ground
In an interview with the German editorial network (RND), local resident Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Have you been there yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned of the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport in Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our "World Vision" office has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have lined up on surrounding hills, where they still linger for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they don't have access to water and food.
Some are staying in front of their homes, and there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores, as well as the petrol stations, are completely closed, people sometimes smell food and gasoline.
The civil service has been completely shut down, and the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the prisoners are running around freely, and it is difficult to find them.
Many bodies are still lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information on the island work?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that it didn't work and we only got information over the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people they don't know if they live and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know why, but when the warning came, many people thought "Okay, not a tsunami" - and then it came.
In other regions that have not been hit by the tsunami, there has been misinformation that a tsunami is hitting the region and they have run into the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, and the earthquake has affected a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to give up on Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long period of time.
Aogo pulled up a muscle fibre crack in the rear left thigh at the 2: 1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the German football league announced on Sunday.
In Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle fracture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and are likely to miss games after the next break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast for the downtime.
A muscle bundle crack usually heals within six to eight weeks, and a muscle fiber crack usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of hyper-realism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival closes the ranks of Europe's most prestigious festivals every year.
Despite all the absences to the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia, and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Hollywood Oscars, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching fire brigade tried to catch an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers on Lake Olchingen noticed a white, wounded duck on Sunday morning.
She stayed in the area of the water station.
To help the animal, passers-by called the police and the fire brigade.
However, the first attempts to catch the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the force again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to circle the animal and push it back to shore, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a bold grip.
The duck, which was injured in the chest, was then taken to the LMU veterinary clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But according to initial estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard picks up World Cup medal
In fourth place at Olympia, biathlete Julian Eberhard was in the stomach for a long time.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to make up for the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The final shot cost the 31-year-old a close-range medal in the Pyeongchang Olympic sprint.
Seven tenths of a second ended up missing out on bronze.
"I deliberately gave myself time to process this," Eberhard said at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point, you'll have to strike.
The World Cup track in Östersund (SWE) is located in Eberhard: "I have already closed the track in my heart," he remembers with joy at his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the relay, he finished in second place in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbo pace
The time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at the turbo pace, Republicans in the US Senate want to secure a razor-thin majority for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial on charges of coercion.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline of Friday for investigators to investigate the alleged incidents, which date back more than 30 years.
The latest twist in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's appointment, which was accompanied by a culture fight, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing between Kavanaugh and first lady Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer sparked angry tirades against opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when, contrary to his initial announcement, Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared that he would agree, but called for an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who on Thursday referred to the serious allegations as "shouting," initially refrained from further attacks on the women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune."
In this way, final doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They're trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI probe into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
A government official told the Wall Street Journal, "They're not going on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" in the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit will be stationed on Gartenstrasse from Monday, 1 October.
This is also where the Federal School Centre is located.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You've felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first victory of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first victory of the season.
However, against Mainz, the factor of time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - It is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were lots of corners and lots of balls in our penalty area, "said Schalke's sporting director 04 - and breathed in.
After all, the Königsblauen still managed to seal the narrow 1: 0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 had given safety to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco: "Overall, the first half was good, both in terms of play and in terms of pressing," Tedesco obviously played more and more of a role as the game progressed.
Schöpf not really a headball monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said: "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The guys were afraid to give it out of their hands and so they kept pulling out.
And defended against Mainz with a man and a mouse.
To save the first three meters of the season.
"We all have a huge stone from our hearts," said Schöpf, who did not play an insignificant part in this with his head ball hit: "I'm actually the worst head ball player in the team."
But at the end of the day, only victory matters.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including, of course, at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the early stages and make a firework out of it," Schalke's head coach said.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, quietly and bravely, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Arguably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau failed to worry more about clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the bar 59 / 72, or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a trembling victory," Tedesco said: "You've already felt the fear a bit."
So I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column visible in the Leitzachtal valley 2 km
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From around two kilometres away, a hiker observed a fire in the Leitzachtal valley at around 1.30pm on Sunday.
The police are now investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause was soon discovered by the police and fire brigade: An unknown man had ignited rubbish on a two-square-metre area on the Gschwenden mountain.
According to police, he appeared to have been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the blaze unattended.
And that's close to the forest.
Thirty Fischbach firefighters were busy pulling and extinguishing.
Police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on a level playing field
The author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani, is standing in front of them.
He has once again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfeld Treffs" - the association that cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance in organising the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describing the writing process of the book, talking about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and one or two joke, he brings one of the most conflict-ridden topics to the listeners: Migration and integration.
Why, in spite of successful integration, do conflicts increasingly arise?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at one table, and first-generation migrants sit at the cat's table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to be part of the decision-making process.
This leads to conflict.
For this reason, it is not the political right or the left that is decisive, but: "Am I in favour of or against an open society?," he stresses.
At the beginning, it was rather subdued, and then the discussion started to get more and more active.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among pupils.
El-Mafaalani is on the scene, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: She is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "it is only when we understand what the problem is that we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing hour, he still had an open ear for the questions of the guests and was also discussed intensively in the foyer, in the case of prepared Kurdish specialities.
Basketball: Bonn and Giessen win kick-off games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn finished the first day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and away victory.
Casting prevailed in a hard-fought match in its own hall with 91: 84 (43: 46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonner won at the BG Göttingen with 86: 79 (49: 47).
Alba Berlin is the first runner-up of the season after the 112: 55 Gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the start of the new season, German champions Bayern Munich and former serial champion Brose Bamberg had a lot more trouble.
Munich already struggled on Friday to reach an 83: 77 at Ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84: 80 on Saturday.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is obviously huge: More than 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the properties in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new Landsham-Süd area on the open market.
This is what Mayor Roland Frick is saying.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 properties offered by the municipality at more favourable terms and prices - similar to the previous local model - has been completed.
According to Frick, more than 100 applications have been received.
"At the moment, the documents are being examined," with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Plieningen, the aim is to have drawn up the candidate rankings for the 20 properties by the end of the year and to present them to the local council.
After that, the award could take place.
In total, 50 plots of land for single and double houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-family houses, each of which is expected to have eight residential units.
The development is now almost complete, and the roads and paths will soon be paved.
A single plot of land as well as two of the apartment buildings belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells most of the land on the open market, 20 plots in a socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two apartment buildings in the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments funded by the Free State.
Room for 200 people
Roughly estimated, residential space for around 200 people is being created on the surface of the newly built Landsham-Süd area.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start is being made there for the construction of a new nursery.
It will house three kindergarten and three nursery groups, as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalke's Naldo "great sport" also succeeds on the bench
For the third time in a row, not in the starting line-up: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had sat for the third time in a row, not in the Schalker start-up, but on the replacement tank, the understanding would have been great for many people if the Brazilian, who is almost two metres tall, had really spoken of the frustration of the soul.
But when, after the 1-0 victory over FSV Mainz 05, the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle as usual and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco for all his pros, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo for simplicity, stepped in and said: "Thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his re-existence as a reserve player, had no resentment at all.
Probable Naldo, who was celebrated as the best Schalker last season, knows that he is not really on the sidelines with his coach - but gets a break for good reasons.
A reason called "stress control."
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'll tell you that honestly," Tedesco said of the moment he told Naldo he wasn't in the starting line-up.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the club, "Tedesco justified the move.
Naldo has played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important for everyone to be able to snap through at the moment.
And that we're all on board, "Tedesco explained of the rotation, which has also recently caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: By also proving himself to be an exemplary team player on the bench.
In August, the mood in Austria's industry accelerated its decline in comparison to the euro zone.
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low of 46.7 points.
Despite this, Austria has the third best mood in Europe, behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1, but the index is still below the 50-meter mark for the 13th month in a row, indicating growth.
Only Ireland's industry hit that threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The Greeks were at the bottom (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March, at 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened slump may well mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But the industry - at least in the third quarter - remains the number one brake on growth.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: Export orders in the eurozone have fallen as much as they have since November 2011.
As a result, the companies removed jobs for the seventh month in a row.
In China, too, industrial production fell more sharply in August than initially thought.
The mood barometer fell to 47.6 points from 49.3 points in the previous month.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers' Index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are being investigated.
Tuchel's PSG team scores eighth win in eighth league game
September 29, 2018 at 7: 45 p.m.
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel continues to rush from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's soccer championship.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won 3-0 (1-0) thanks to two hits by superstar Neymar, and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.
The last time Olympique Lyon got off to such a good start to the season was 82 years ago in France.
Brazilian Neymar put PSG in the lead after 22 minutes and produced the final score in the offseason.
Christopher Nkunku (46) scored 2-0 in the meantime.
In doing so, Paris also won the rehearsal for the landmark second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the top class, Tuchel's team had suffered the only mandatory match defeat so far this season at 2: 3 in Liverpool.
