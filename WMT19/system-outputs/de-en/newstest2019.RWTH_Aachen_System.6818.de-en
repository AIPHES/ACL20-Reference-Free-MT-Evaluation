"beautiful Munich" 2018!
In the afternoon, another surprise awaits our candidates: they will not contest the romantic candlelight shoot in front of MY SOLARIS alone, but at the side of Male model Fabian!
Hvar - flirting, flirting, seducing - no easy tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Still, the nine "Beautiful Munich" contestants deliver on the shoot with People photographer Tuan, defying wind, spray and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shoot can be seen in the video:
DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB president Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"This is a question which, of course, depends on the fact that you get into a conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as laid down in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung."
Despite the now months-long debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed, up to a certain point, that this would be the case," Grindel said.
In July, the 29-year-old announced his resignation from the DFB team and justified it on the grounds that Grindel had not defended him against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The head of the DFB repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for talks with German coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation hasn't happened so far."
Linz: garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burnt
At 2.13 p.m., the Linz fire brigade was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line runs directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was in arrears.
The fire brigade came out and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and fire debris had to be cleared to the extent that was absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had plugged a battery into the shop at midday.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as has the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, as the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family in street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself live-streamed how she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
The U.S. portal "TMZ" reports this and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "Luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, Lohan can be seen getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family she wants to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
As the family flees the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
It accuses adults of engaging in child trafficking.
She doesn't give evidence for all that in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan can be heard in the video as she continues to follow the family down the street.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan is missing a slap.
In tears, the actress then pleads how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to take this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has'mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe 7.5-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there is talk of at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet entered the devastated areas, which are cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla supervisory board chief
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused concern in stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletrocar maker.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO withdraws from the supervisory board, but he is allowed to remain chairman of the board.
British Conservative Party Congress
Fiercely guarded - the Tories" party congress
Birmingham is becoming the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and hardline Brexiteers, frontline ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over these name duplications for years.
Now they have come to an agreement.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future, and the population is voting on this Sunday - is it going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before Brazil's presidential election, the mood in the country is split.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" claims to be an anti-system candidate, leading the polls.
His fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" overhaul takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," said development board member Peter Mertens to the industry journal "Automobilwoche."
Incarcerated and on leave, Audi CEO Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in dealing with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The taskforce was set up in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "grave organisational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and plans to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the head of Audi of allowing the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust values after the emissions cheating became known.
In doing so, he knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Chief Sales Officer Bram Schot heads the company as acting chief executive.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production losses at Audi, said Schot, the "Heilbronner Stimme."
In principle, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
There are already 15,000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to head to DFB headquarters
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office as DFB president again next year, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair.
"I'm doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said as a guest at ZDF's "Aktuellen Sportstudio" early on Sunday morning.
You have to keep trying for re-election, that's what I'll do.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association would find it "remarkable" if he did not "want to work on the future project" after winning the Euro 2024 football championship.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 in place of Wolfgang Niersbach, who was ousted over the summer fairytale affair.
In the fall of 2016, he was elected for a first full three-year term.
The next vote will take place at the DFB-Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future head of the European Championships, Philipp Lahm, is to participate in the DFB Presidency.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will continue to advise on this role in the Bureau and then, of course, be cordially invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migrant background should become an integration ambassador for the DFB.
Cacau and Celia Sasic, born in Brazil, are currently holding this office, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background is clearly involved in society and football and says, "the issue is important, we have to take care of it," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Correct weight loss with half-wise scales
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat percentage.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index is also calculated, but this is more for the sausages.
Does he not say anything about whether I have replaced fat with muscle?
Basketball-Bundesliga: clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the Basketball League with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up easily won 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing match for more than 40 minutes.
New recruit Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The Ludwigsburg-bound national Johannes Thiemann (18 count) also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators on his must-win debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg on the mandatory debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis.
Augustine Rubit was the best scorer among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came in at 14 points.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg beat Frankfurt's Fraport Skyliners 83:76 (41:34).
New Nationals player Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter on coach John Patrick's team with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the Basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
New playmaker Will Cummings topped Oldenburg with 25 points.
Braunschweig, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run by the Baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
Cologne's city centre had been partially closed for the opening of the Ditib Mosque.
Several thousand policemen were deployed - including snipers.
The Islam Association Ditib is facing criticism because it is considered to be an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: stars, boos and scares
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have appealed for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Enjoy wherever you can," Mendes told around 60,000 spectators at the festival on Sunday night.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid agencies, also showed up on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, though, there was a scare when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was gunshots, scared and tried to flee.
Panic briefly arose, people ran into each other.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organiser Hugh Evans.
However, New York police and musician Chris Martin then reassured people from the stage.
"Nobody is trying to hurt anybody," Martin said.
You are all safe.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet.
Those who wanted to get one had to read and disseminate on the Internet texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there were cheers and applause from the audience - boos, on the other hand, for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
The latter, together with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke out on the stage in favour of greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, though, Flake had argued in the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court justice, headbutting many women.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse, including attempted rape, against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for a FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who say they have experienced sexual assault themselves, confronted him in an elevator on the way to the committee meeting.
"You can also get together with me in an elevator at any time," Flake said to the crowd at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: Federal government defends journalist's ouster
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the ouster of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
At the chancellery, the Turkish journalist, who lives in Hamburg, had pulled over a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for journalists" and had gone to the front row.
The T-shirt, was not the problem, Seibert told Bild am Sonntag.
It was about disrupting the running of the press conference.
The action of the journalist caused a great deal of disquiet, which was unacceptable.
He had therefore arranged for people protection officers to take the man out.
Seibert said that it is not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
There are many journalists in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: it was only at the beginning of September that the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but trials are still underway in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht," produced by NDR, is known for moist conversations at the counter of the Hamburg port pub "Schellfischposten."
Presenter Ina Müller and her guests come across a lot of beer, some wine or even high-percentage drinks to lighten the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities are also emboldened by the obligatory vocals.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: the actor Florian David Fitz known from movies like "Männerherzen," "Terror - Ihr Verdict" or "Der geilste Tag."
But the trip to the far north did not go well for Munich.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face completely crumpled on it, eyes just two small slits left.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not ill, he only has a powerful hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - perhaps not very serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And splash.
And let go of the round of egg liqueur that Ina throws at half past three.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the aftershocks.
They ranged from instant broth, fish sandwiches or - presumably most purposeful - headache tablets.
Others were simply amused by the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
It is not yet known how Ina Müller survived the nightly sedition.
But since she has been hosting the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has struggled with vandalism and treachery
The entrance to the 36-kilometre track in the Red Riding Hood in Treysa is difficult to find and is littered.
Prescriptions against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Shards, cigarette butts, rubbish and rubbish, demolished bins and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entrance to the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the flagship railway track in the Red Riding Hood region, a more than inauspicious sight.
The topic has been occupying members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt for some time, according to the cycling commissioner of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The issue has already been raised in the cycling advisory council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also introduced the topic to the local advisory board.
It's not just the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting point at weekends to celebrate.
Not only is it often loud, but the racks are also destroyed: posts are torn from the ground, bins are demolished, signs are knocked over, seating is smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the resting place on the cycle path in Treysa is the meeting place for sunrises.
"along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the cyclist, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea, he said, is video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly, this sets the threshold much higher for attacking common property.
This would, however, require that a police patrol pass by in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants the Haaße hill to develop.
It must be made more attractive.
You can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
The marketing of tourism can still be expanded.
Our bike path is of a very high quality compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
As a highly critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There is no turning lane on the Haaße hill.
In the case of heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between the two sides of the traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: the "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family get-together over coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long Albanian living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city.
What were the lyricists associated with?
In the villages, the Hiltruper Lake and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue as the "Kö von Hiltrup" in his beating song.
The cultural station was also honored.
Time and again, it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short remodeling breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
Humberg was told that he had actually studied chemistry, but was now also teaching guitar.
Franke knew from the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has placed a lot on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others could also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, which particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children performed again at the final - and sounded "right good" even without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its 10th anniversary.
She considered the event to be a complete success.
All were "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which - the old trick with the red slide - can only be deciphered once you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side will not be able to read anything by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2nd window.
3. Dice.
4th Feast."
These are the terms to be encrypted from now on.
For it is not the terms that are to be guessed here, but codes.
Alternately one player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card that maybe says "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto" it is not the terms behind the secret foil that are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "furniture," "feast" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, if possible, win the game if he succeeds twice in cracking the code.
The encrypter thus notes and reads aloud: "throwing" for the cubes, "lose" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention at school and knows the collapse of the window there.
That's how it goes round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but it can be better combined with any hint that the encrypter gives there.
The rewrites should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The online explanation video at decrypto.info makes it easier.
But once you get started, you'll be intrigued by how much feeling there is in this unassuming game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as coherent as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames," which also puts an agent's theme on a game of fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if it's all about guessing and not winning points, you can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests at pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspectorate twice during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler salute to a passing police patrol in the Upper City, then later he also appeared in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he failed to comply with the police's decision to give him a seat, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate in the detention cell.
In a sober state, he then also faces criminal charges for using license plates of unconstitutional organizations.
The Pressig plant was home to the locomotives
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Franconian Forest for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers cracked on buffers, you heard it all over Pressig," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
It didn't excite anyone.
The brakes squeaked and the wagons snatched.
That was pure railways.
Statements that are emblematic of Dinkel's homeland, Pressig.
Nowhere in the Franconian Forest has a place been so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen-Bergstrecke to the north, which has its peak in Steinbach am Wald after an increase of about 220 meters.
In order to cope with this, it used to be necessary to have train and thrust locomotives, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, railway management and railway mastery.
"Herzstück was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and a career trainer for 47 years.
Locomotives for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben were also operated by the Deutsche Bahnbetriebswerk (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160; 13 steam locomotives and eight electric locomotives were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and thrust locomotives.
From 1977, they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weighers were still ranked in the month.
In 1982, parts of the factory were demolished, and in 1991 the rest were demolished.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we did not consider a better use of the site, also in terms of freight traffic."
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the electrification of Nuremberg - Saalfeld.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, the end.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, and the Pressig marshalling yard was history.
"The rangers and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any misstep would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station of Pressig-Rothenkirchen led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing like Julia Görges before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the third world rankings is either Yulia Putinzewa from Kasachsten or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian in number 13 gave up.
The sister-in-law is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the "art and pleasure" series, a special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened at the weekend.
Organizers and visitors registered the ideal weather with great relief when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open area of the Dahlmann- Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourist association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the "art and pleasure" series.
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be seen in Mittelehrenbach.
Homeowner Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
As did Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in tried and tested young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have helped to design flyers.
Once again this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is a special 70-cent stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen," designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high level of support of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical frame.
Walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "wind game performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" is waiting for the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully equipped with 20 wind turbines, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object appears fairy-tale-like and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K.
There are many parts, moving in the wind.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child."
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colourful imagination of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme of "wind game performance" for strolling through the multi-faceted art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday festively
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians also vented their displeasure at the time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to come to terms with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should no longer be a sane life in the district.
It has become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbusch, they launched the MGV 68 Albachten.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary has been celebrated in the "House of Encounter."
"It's going to be full today," chairman Jürgen Holstiege guessed, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball became it, festive clothes had been asked for before.
The guests were not sitting in rows of seats, as usual in the "House of Encounters," but sitting comfortably at tables.
In between, movement was the order of the day: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled the knobs and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten sounded the voice themselves.
Happy songs were announced to coincide with the occasion.
Almost set: "such a day, as beautiful as it is today."
To match the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein."
Alluding to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hops."
Once again, the choral direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time, was sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege, "he has such an easy way, it's a feat he does." By the way, this time it wasn't just men who were singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.
After all, there was still poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at his desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented fine-sounding poetry.
There was also a big raffle.
The proceeds will be used to finance a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd women's league: USC II wins top-class derby against BW Aasee
The upstart marches.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is right in League Three.
No hint of shyness or freckles, the independents are doing their thing.
And that's really good at 3-0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city rival BW Aasee.
"that wasn't crystal clear, but we've already made an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately concurred: "This is a defeat we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied," on the contrary.
In the evening, at a later birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the score had a set ball.
"When they get it to the finish line, a game like this can kick in," Büring knows from years of experience.
After all, USC, with its routine powers, made it all clear and brought the full yield to the finish.
"We are all aware of who is on the other side in such a derby.
It doesn't break our neck.
I've seen really good volleyball in stages," Annacker didn't contend with the 0:3 - and immediately moved on to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for independents does not seem to be foreseeable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels vindicated: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
That's not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball," they don't want to look down on the fourth division anyway.
Should the vest not be soiled in the next few weeks, they will have to look up.
But a first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we will go to Emlichheim for the first time.
Aasee will compete in Essen on 14 October.

Four injured after accident at crossing in Hildburghausen
Four people have been injured in an accident.
According to information so far, one motorist had not noticed the other's driveway on Coburger Straße just before noon on Sunday.

Glider crashes - flight student fatally shot
The pilot died in the crash of a glider in Essen.
The single-seater plane crashed into a parking lot near Essen-Mülheim airport on Sunday afternoon when it landed, a police spokesman said in Essen on Sunday.
The parking lot next to Highway 52, which is normally used for shuttle traffic to the fair, was largely empty, other people were not injured in the crash.
Emergency chaplains continued to attend to flight students and eyewitnesses at the scene.
In the immediate vicinity was the venue of an Oktoberfest, in the evening numerous guests were expected there.
The cause of the crash was initially unclear - the weather was good, there was light wind and sunshine.
Essen-Mülheim is a small airport, which is used a lot by pilots with light private planes.
About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship," Heide Keller became a star.
Now she talks openly about the fact that the series may have been complicit in her marriage loss to Hans von Borsody.
Her role of chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left for good.
The series, which made her a star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"that might also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world with a suitcase alone, and many of my admired colleagues perceived me on an equal footing," says Keller in conversation with the "Bild am Sonntag."
At first, she was always "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "dream ship."
For now, the journalists were only calling at Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so much, I don't know."
She considers it possible that her husband at the time may well have been envious, but "like many men, Hans shunned conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller always tried to be "the only right thing for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've changed my mind," she continues.
She always felt she was "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who, in truth, I never was, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I sat in the cloakroom crying and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why it never worked out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
At the time, Keller had imagined love "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love far too naively."
The night clerk, who regularly explores the city's nightlife at the NZZ-Ressort Zürich, has ventured into the ZFF opening party this time.
Our wrinkle is not a moth, but a little shy of light.
And the glare in which a green carpet is bathed on the Sechseläutenplatz dazzles him excessively.
But it's just a film festival, more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So he tore across the square this late Thursday evening to ease up briefly in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase."
This is the name of the public toilet facility, sponsored by a large plumbing company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: the need centre on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks to the sky in the Lord's Oasis for some reason.
So get out of here, cross over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who have just entertained at the best level in the cinema next door to the opening film "Green Book," celebrate the start of the festival as every year with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as you know, the works shown come from all over the world.
What do you not have to come up with in an article about this festival in order not to fall into surreptitious advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The wrinkle binds a ribbon around the feelers, which has added a good fairy to it, and two bullish doormen actually wave it in generously.
Inside, the invited crowd, they dance to live music well after midnight, or let DJ dictate rhythms to which they shout at each other, and rinse down exquisite appetizers with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the souterrain, oysters wait for sipping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly sliced, a chocolate fountain is sprouted.
And the hammer is: all the shelves full of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been going on for years, so it seems to work without much loss.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studies the sign at the escalator: "wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator."
If these are two separate instructions, he has got lost in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the household goods department upstairs, the poultry man dumps a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye," matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting the brand for years, is not here in the evening either.
But there, between the local celebrity, the cash desk and kitchen items, there is a face that is familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main character is not likely to be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, almost acting like a choir boy at the age of sixty, walks through the crowd.
He isn't being chastised, he isn't being groomed, at most he is being stealthily scolded.
It is precisely for this restraint, often misunderstood as clumsiness, that international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team's victory.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona appears to have settled in well in his new native Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to cumbia rhythms with a player in the cab, as can be seen in a video released earlier on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, booed by the players.
The Mexican second-tier side beat the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the match, Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send after last-minute bust "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "such a bitter defeat." His protégés were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) bust - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly for long periods, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we slept completely," the ASV coach was annoyed.
The landlords quickly led by 8:1, even the early time off that Bieletzki had taken didn't bear fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a jolt went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of a hour.
At the break, the gap was only two goals.
Above all, Sendens Bester, Marius Hintze, met at the stage one by one.
After the change, things got even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalised at 15:15, after which the relay changer led almost entirely.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still a seemingly reassuring three hits (29:26).
And then?
The non-partisans intervened.
Bieletzki is usually wary of finding fault with others.
But: Steffen Mühlhoff's 120-second time penalty "was a joke."
Lit had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood up well against seven men at the back and kept throwing on the empty goal.
But they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now there has to be a damn victory," said Bieletzki, who was completely serving.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Bouncing (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), police are searching for the woman's remains.
Emergency services dug up a road at Marxgrün on Saturday.
To this end, the pavement and several layers below it were removed, police and prosecutors jointly announced.
According to new evidence, the missing person may not have been buried far from where they lived at the time.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
Investigators did not rule out a crime at the time, either.
Since last year, the forensic police Hof, together with the public prosecutor's office, have reportedly been working intensively on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Heritage Protection Authority, the investigators came across an abnormality under the street near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, officials bordered the site to a few feet.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacking attack on millions of Facebook users highlights the dangers lurking on the web.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated sequences of letters, users should use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, and there is no harm in equipping computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his looming dismissal as head of the billionaire firm.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission settled an out-of-court dispute over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla will pay $20 million each, and Musk will serve as chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German chairman of the supervisory board.
He is allowed to remain chief executive against it.
In the settlement, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager in Manhattan federal court for fraud.
Musk, who also heads space firm SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk had it declared he had done nothing wrong and was saddened and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock market, paying $420 per share, saying the funding was secured.
That would have valued Tesla at $72 billion in total.
Later, Musk backtracked: Tesla remains on the stock market.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team 1-1 at Chelsea
Liverpool FC still came to a 1-1 draw at Chelsea.
In the top game at Chelsea, the attacker, who had just been replaced by coach Jürgen Klopp, secured a 1-1 draw in the 89th minute (0:1).
After six wins to start, Liverpool dropped to second.
Chelsea remain third, new front-runner is Manchester City.
Eden Hazard provided the Chelsea lead in the 25th minutes with his sixth goal of the season.
After that, the Klopp team missed the equaliser several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger cleared after a solo by Liverpool's goalscorer Mohamed Salah on the line (31st).
Shortly before the end, Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a slugger to the angle.
Record champions Manchester United are slipping deeper and deeper into crisis after their worst start to the season since 1989.
The team of controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United deservedly with 1:3 (0:2) and remains only in the table midfield with ten points after seven days of play.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match against Valencia FC.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno joined his first Premier League effort after an injury to Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League match at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won 2-0 against Brighton Albion through goals from Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Agüero (65th).
Leroy Sané prepared for 1-0, Ilkay Gündogan did not feature in the new front-runner.
"Let's Dance" juror Joachim Llambi and Ms. Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi has probably separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known through the RTL show "Let's Dance."
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhal's content) reports on the separation of the well-known presenter and dance expert, citing Llambi's lawyer.
"Our clients have separated amicably and amicably," said the lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser, according to "BamS."
The most important thing for the two is the well-being of their two daughters.
The couple had met in a pizzeria in 2003 and married two years later, according to the report.
Joachim Llambi hails from Duisburg and has been a successful tournament dancer and stockbroker.
Llambi became known on television for his jurorship at the celebrity dance show "Let's Dance" on RTL, as well as for various appearances in quiz and entertainment programmes.

Polls: 46 percent don't want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
Following the squabbles of the past few weeks, GroKo is racking up several poll lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a questioning - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday trend for Bild am Sonntag.
In the weekly poll conducted by the polling institute, the AfD increases by one count to 17 percent, the SPD drops one point compared to the previous week and ends up at 16 percent.
The CDU and the CSU also lose one count and only reach 27 percent.
That's the lowest score yet for the union in Sunday's trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If there were a general election on Sunday, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU would get only 43 percent of the votes together, according to Emnid.
With this, the grand coalition has currently lost the majority on Sunday's issue at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently win 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 general election, they received a combined 53.4 percent.
Among the other parties, the range is also wide: the AfD, the second-biggest party in several polls, comes in at 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens achieve a vote share of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is 10 percent on average, while the FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the share of the vote.
But support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) among the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the chancellery, according to the Emnid survey commissioned by the BamS.
According to the poll, only one in two (50 per cent) currently want the grand coalition to hold until the next regular general election in three years, while 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
A further poll published on Saturday also showed significant drops in popularity for Merkel.
Divided, the Germans also judge whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
Forty-seven percent are in favour, while 44 percent are against, according to Emnid.
In the case of supporters of the Union, 64% want a candidacy, while 35% do not.
Aushang bei Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic get-to-know stories - they should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket is almost an anachronistic romance as a meeting place for great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer shorts at the wading table or favourite pudding is, in doubt, still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being a slippery stock exchange rather than a contact one.
We dared the test: how do women react, you don't talk around the bush for long in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
There is real Hollywood-Lovestory potential when love happiness is preceded by an out-of-the-eyes-lost-and-refound plot.
If the guy gets in touch with his beloved at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, it sounds a lot like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So the creator of this advertisement in an Aldi branch, unknown to us, is very much to be desired that she will also find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic pit meat."
For her belief in the magic of getting to know the analogy, she definitely deserves her happy ending à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri school has participated in the campaign "Deckel gegen Polio - 500 caps for a life without polio."
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease, described in German as polio, leads from signs of paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered to have been eradicated, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, polioviruses, can only be contained by vaccination, according to a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand calm for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sporting director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
It doesn't do the boy any good.
And that doesn't do us any good," said Reus, who is friends with Götze, after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen on Sky TV.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No rush for contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the Bundesliga club Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no rush in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We have not even talked about a treaty.
There's no fixed date for when we do that.
"But there will certainly be the moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl told Sky TV on Sunday evening.
Football: Bezirksliga: researcher VfL Wolbeck's performance against SC Altenrheine is encouraging
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
He gave himself a word, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (inwardly) to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime it is running again around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufresher evidence is Sunday's 1-1 draw against SC Altenrheine, in the past season only razor-sharp past the ascent.
Yes, I'm very happy with the performance.
'We've made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and sought out each individual for the match, simply to say "thank you" for so much opposition to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg came on - the 4-4-2 went almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes was in the front line waiting for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first period.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his exit (17th), substituted Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
It almost took revenge when the SCA hit the Wolbeck box dangerously twice in minute 41, in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL cheekily took full control.
Thewes from 18 yards narrowly failed.
Schroer, too, came too late after 58 minutes on a Thewes entry.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch once again missed a fresh-cell cure on the left.
When Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer fell to Robin Westhue in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free-kick for the groundsmen 18 metres in front of the guest house.
The foul himself competed and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right slap struck down the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1-0 (71st).
20 minutes left, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty area awkwardly in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79th).
Wolbeck had to survive anguished minutes in the closing stages before Geske had the winner in the 87th minute from twelve metres.
Might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4-1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five days of play - that couldn't be enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure their first home win.
Striker Ante Rebic, who was in the starting XI for the first time after an injury, should help with that.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also back after a shambolic injury and, with his header strength, should prevent the SGE from conceding further goals to standards.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
On landing, there was an accident at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
At around 2 p.m., there was a drama at the airfield in Kottingbrunn on Sunday.
The landing of a helicopter caused turbulence, the police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was hit by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a halt laterally.
The police, rescue and fire brigade were immediately notified.
The emergency services arrived at the scene with a large contingent.
The ÖAMTC emergency medical helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Luckily, it all turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only property damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to return home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are under investigation.
According to fire brigade spokesman Franz Resperger, a small blaze occurred, but it was quickly extinguished.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on company boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female as of September 1, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture," which will be officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was available to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to set themselves up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them by," said foundation managing director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, male-only management teams - with few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
By comparison, the lag makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and forward-looking.
It's a different corporate culture.
The small increase in the proportion of women among the German stock exchange companies is also due solely to positive impulses among the companies in the medium-sized index (MDax).
True, according to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women in the coming year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that they would not continue to make a voluntary commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture emerges with the boards of directors: as of 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"If just as many women were recruited to the boards every year, a share of 40 percent would be reached as early as 2023," says the report.
Some even make a fuss: luxury car bodies: which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserve best.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the premium suppliers makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros in operating profit with every car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only gets around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley are even putting up a lot with every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices ranging from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in earnings before interest and tax EBIT.

The long-time No.1 finally ended her career at the end of last year with 25 Grand Slam titles - five in singles.
In July she married trainer Harald Leemann.
She did not reveal the date of birth.
Torchlight procession for the opening of the 60th Abtswind Wine Festival
The tourist association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session with a torchlight procession.
For the 60th time, the association is organising the wine festivals, which will be held every Saturday in October in the large marquee on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the jubilee, the people in charge moved through the town to the Festplatz under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn.
The chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe, welcomed the guests in the already prolific marquee. "To do something like this for 60 years - this is an insanity for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine princess Lisa II later symbolically clashed with the guests from the stage.
"beautiful that so many have found their way to Abtswind again." Later, "Die Troglauer" created a mood.
On Sunday, when the Abtswind church consecration was also celebrated, on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon, the association set the price of drinks as it did 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival will take place on Friday, October 5, at the guest's house, before the second round takes place a day later in the marquee.
In Bonn: emergency car crashes into taxi
An emergency doctor's car stands badly damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passerby was fatally injured in the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they are supposed to help - best of all save lives.
Such a rescue trip came to a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in the collision of an emergency medical vehicle with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and her driver were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency medical car had run over a red light with blue light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then collided on a crossing with the taxi, which was driving at Green.
The doctor's car swerved against a traffic light pole and a tree after the collision.
In the process, he captured the passer-by, who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of emergency doctor's car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency doctor's car were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed by emergency services.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but she could no longer help the pedestrian.
Another emergency doctor called in tried to do so - but to no avail.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn Public Prosecutor's Office, are investigating who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho we're uncomfortable
Manchester United are now also losing in the 7th round of the Premier League following their embarrassing defeat in the League Cup.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1:3. The manner of the defeat is likely to be still to be talked about.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute, in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic shot 3-1 for West Ham; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Suspecting an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester's defensemen stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to kick the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of a performance that had already been insufficient for a long time.
The mood at United's city rivals Manchester City is very different at the moment.
The Citizens, trained by Mourinho's great rival Pep Guardiola, came to an unbeaten 2-0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half a hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the outsider's defensive bar for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goal scorer, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer top of the table
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri won a 1-1 draw with Liverpool in the Premier League against Chelsea.
As with the cup exit, Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man at the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's score in the 25th minute remained the only score of the game until the closing stages.
Shaqiri, who came onto the field for Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute, narrowly missed the equaliser after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
So, after the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea could not be beaten for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the cup, and the league's draw saw the Blues beat Liverpool from the top of the table.
Like City, London's two city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2-0 victories.
However, fans of the Gunners, with Granit Xhaka playing through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success against the surprise team from Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart awkwardly bumped into Alex Iwobi's own goal, just two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to their fifth successive win and are now just behind big rivals Tottenham in fifth place. A strong impression continues to be left by upstart Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten in their 2-0 win over Southampton in the league for the fifth year in a row, finishing 8th.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show to mark diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet ubiquitous: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of the German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showcasing their innovations together with the competition from around the world in the French capital from next week.
Diesel doesn't really play a big role in this anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should nevertheless be an important topic, at least behind the shiny scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and, among other things, have their first pure electric models with them: the Ingolstadt e-tron is due to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
But both have already been officially presented.
BMW's iNext is not due to start until 2021.
The focus in Paris is the new 3 Series.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which this year celebrates its 120th birthday, takes place every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were a good one million visitors.
The severe earthquakes and subsequent tsunami have killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 people injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second a magnitude of 7.4.
Communications and transport links have been damaged, and enormous material damage has been caused.
After the quakes, the tsunami hit the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a celebration.
It is feared that the number of victims is still rising significantly.
The figures so far only come from Palu.
But many other communities are also affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate church service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at Haus Nordhelle on the last Sunday of each month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to celebrate a service that was anything but ordinary.
As early as 10 a.m., the bolides were lined up in front of the entrance to the church.
At first, the biker breakfast was on the agenda and it was possible to strengthen itself with coffee and cake or even with a hearty currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given during the biker service by the Rev. Dirk Grzegorek.
Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical background.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill is more poetic and calm," said the Rev. Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big festival: After the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active at the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and, step by step, demonstrated to his astonished spectators the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
From time to time, Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the large funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how this would turn into a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in moulds and enveloped by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which look a bit like chopsticks, on top of each other layer by layer.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step was not so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large jar.
But the farmer from Füchtorfer also had ready-to-eat specialities.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the older visitors with the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents talked, while the children were not only able to follow the process of pressing apples, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Activists from the Füchtorfer camaraderie of former soldiers also got involved in the festival, inviting them to entertaining games at some stations.
The Heimatverein will also offer a day of action in the coming year.
But then, stressed Gregor Krützkamp, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the scene.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: after all, it will be around the milk.
1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth bust of the season: "Beschissene Situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in succession, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
A lot of positive things were not seen before in the 1:4 (0:2) final of the table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shrewd situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," said 96 football pundit Pirmin Schwegler, pushing back: "That's obviously disappointing, because you always take a lot."
The winless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) finished, is at the bottom with two points and is a candidate for relegation in its current constitution.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored goals in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who advanced to the midfield of the table with seven points after the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Rome.
Croatia's runner-up Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action by the Hessen on his starting debut and never got to grips with Hanover's defence.
The striker, long struggling after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable to concussion.
In addition to Rebic, Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was also in the starting line-up of Frankfurt for the first time, which began swinging.
A header deflected onto the goal net by Lucas Torró (17th) brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defence of Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords was almost inevitable and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a deflected corner, Haller extended by head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot down.
It was the first Bundesliga match for the French second-rower AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt followed suit before the break.
This time, Haller matched his Storm partner Rebic, who skillfully tanked and left 96 goalie Michael Esser with no chance.
At half-time, Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak showing of his 11 and brought two new offensive powers to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played a little more courageously forward, but ignominious ideas remained until shortly before the end, when at least the opening goal was achieved.
The state of Hesse was much more efficient.
After just under a hour, Rebic started a solo and then laid across on De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only show-jumping for the Frankfurt against overwhelmed guests, Jovic also hit a minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.

Geisingen: Geising Christians celebrate Holy Cross festival
The Geising Catholics celebrate the feast of the Holy Cross on 14 September or the Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, followed by a procession to the Church of the Holy Cross with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross is home to the shot Christ, who is from the 30-year-old war and on whom, according to legend, a Swedish soldier is said to have shot.
Blood then flowed from the gunshot wound.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
It has not been finished to this day, only the altar room is standing, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his homily, Reverend Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
The service was poorly attended, despite the importance for the Geising parish.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and the church part of the feast of the Cross ended with the final blessing.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish hall.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish still offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger, on behalf of the parish, informed visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction work, which will continue into next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, it has been possible to determine the damage more precisely and to prepare the individual tenders more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but more has also been found, which was only made possible by the inspection by means of scaffolding.
The plastering of the pedestals has been completed, the natural stone works are to be started before the winter, and it is hoped that more than half of these works will be completed this year.
Inauguration: new dormitory in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life support Donau-Iller opens a new residential home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that "a very special house" is now being handed over to its destination in Münsterblickstrasse - everyone present agreed at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the dormitory of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader took into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans began around eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was put to the test for residents with a mobile phone cap: "The house had come of age and was out of date in terms of equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved in to demolish the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life support Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
The life support invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and fire-proof design was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements, which allowed the residents to experience the freedom to move without the help of others.
The head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, Gertrud Kreutmayer, also expressed a similar view: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile."
In doing so, the homeliness and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it is no longer available in today's situation."
In total, the new residential home in Münsterblickstrasse offers space on almost 1500 square metres for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three residential groups.
Life support managing director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed on a collective basis.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, the deputy leader of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to all compatriots not to resign themselves to the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after nearly 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper.
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans, on average, worked longer than the people of West Germany, but were paid 15 percent less.
"I can't explain that to anyone nearly 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this putative dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is said to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has gifted South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
Moon's office said Sunday that the two dogs, about a year old, reached their recipient as early as Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food in order to "make it easier for the animals to get used to."
The dogs with the thick white coat, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The gift of friendship was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
In doing so, both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and to jointly bid for the 2032 Olympics.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri missile propulsion test facility.
Austria's turbulent history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the centenary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published, most of which answer this question in retrospect over the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it very differently in the magnificent "picture book" of Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to practical work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Grand Coalition, which begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not last mantra-likely evoke the "return to practical work."
This may have led some tradesmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what the difference is between work and practical work, but so be it.
Now that the federal government is ready to return to its task of governing, it should not be prevented from doing so by means of a debate on terms.
Whether the Union and the Social Democratic Party can actually do something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks will be shown by Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties will meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round on a regular basis in order to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, conflict-ridden issues are once again on the agenda with the diesel retrofits and the skilled labour immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get off lightly with exchange premiums, the SPD and CDU see the manufacturers as having a duty to retrofit older diesels.
While a rapprochement has emerged over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart on the planned skilled labour immigration law.
The SPD is calling for a chance to stay for rejected asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be arguments among the coalition partners again - and how should it be otherwise?
It is not the same thing and the same thing that has come together to form GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different views of society and priorities.
Contention is good.
Without a dispute, a society marked by such diverse and sometimes contradictory interests will not move forward.
However, in order to be constructive, disputes must not be raised again for party-political reasons on the question of being or not being.
This is still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD are supposed to fight - but always have the reality of people's lives in mind.
What is feasible and beneficial to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the lane change issue can be resolved pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
That is what the People's Party must fight for now.
Fungus checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in her sights
Does the Minister of Labour, of all people, violate the applicable law of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"really day and night" her legists had been working on the social security reform, an exuberant social affairs minister reported at the presentation two weeks ago.
With list mushroom mandarin Daniela Holzinger, Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) 's statement is met with amazement - she is now taking the matter to Parliament via question.
She said that "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the work of her team and not to announce any violations of the law of service in front of cameras."
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to be able to "acquit Har-tinger of any suspicion."
Police tear up a street in search of woman's body
Marxgrün - For a long time, the police did not want to comment.
Now there's confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, trenches have been dug on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The line is still closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It follows that investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with its guide, was able to limit the relevant spot to a few metres in repeated use.
In addition, a ground anomaly was discovered in the area of the street in question, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian monument protection authority.
For more than a year now, the prosecutor's office and the forensic police have been handling the missing persons case.
Again and again, a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because investigators suspect that Heike's body may have been concealed here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of Catalonia's controversial independence referendum.
But there are already riots before that.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and police broke out in central Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence activists with paint powder, among other things, in order to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units planned a rally to honour their colleagues who were deployed to polling stations last year in what was considered an illegal referendum.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence at the time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central government security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the approximately 6,000 separatists then tried by force to break the police chain and threw paint bags and eggs at the officers, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, it said, citing authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also defected abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, remain in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the compulsory administration was brought to an end.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the "right to self-determination" of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: accumulated perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split scoreless
Red and white Ahlen continues on the spot.
Even at FC Gütersloh, it was only enough for a 0-0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion, they turned out to be the final and the third last as a congregation.
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor.
Those who wanted to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so unconcerned.
There was no risk of missing a scoring opportunity, because there were virtually none.
First shot after half a hour
Gütersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire match in the 28th minute.
The Ahleners had the best - and in principle only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling into a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty spot.
The hosts were even more innocuous.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel took aim from 18 metres just above the casing and after a hour, the Güterslohers also made an offensive appearance for the first time.
After a ball-tampering by Matthaeus Wieckowicz, things went fixed.
Nick Flock (62nd) "crowned" the quick-witted counter over Sinan Aygün with a lazy shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also trailed with a Wieckowicz header (66th) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahleners did not succeed.
It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but even that didn't yield anything.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like the fact that we played to zero," but unfortunately the zero was also in front.
"This time we weren't as torrid as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent didn't want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, everything "ploughed up a bit" against a team "that just wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel that we could get an opposition," said Daut.
To his chagrin, however, as a spectator, one did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
The idea was too feeble for that.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for which these donations are intended, are delighted.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, while the space was still a little empty, but that should change during the day.
Because: "It's so pretty sociable here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organiser of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus greeted the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit with a decent pinch of humour, as always.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed up against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has fallen ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" did not allow itself to entertain the more and more visitors in between musically.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at the end of the hour.
"just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date in his schedule this time.
He's delighted with the many actives with their stands, including mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a blackboard," he thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of all those who were on duty at the stands and also included the other parties that took place in September and the "clean up" action.
Our garden town gives itself a colourful coat of paint - there's something going on here.
Then the May wreath was taken down by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarters.
At many booths, work was done for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty, everything was to be had.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, got creative at his decoupling saw.
He offered veneer works, coasters with Reckenfelder motifs and a lot more.
Three beekeepers from Reckenfelder offered a speciality: "Reckenfelder Honig," brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter still has a speciality in it.
Honey cake in a glass, of course, with honey from my own production.
Since the little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
The conviviality is what made the visitors linger long into the evening hours, even without a stage programme that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Smears with local political message: No successful advertising for skate park
In Lengerich, unknown people have promoted the construction of a skate park in a way that is hardly conducive to success.
There are similar smears in several places, says Jürgen Khne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" were emblazoned on signs at the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that an appropriate lettering had already been discovered on the advertising sign at the stairway to the Gempt bistro after the professional election fair on 19 September.
Since the short message at the time appeared to have been left "only" with an edding, it could easily be removed.
"some days later, however, it was back, this time sprayed up," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign will have to be replaced.
A special feature of this case is the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate park is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
Promises have already been made, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the embossed board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the subject of skateboarding.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL Clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the majority of the Council was in favour of the fire brigade car park.
However, this suggestion was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a building at this point.
An U-turn followed at the end of June.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously in favour of the Gutenberg School.
As far as the state of affairs is concerned, Jürgen Khne says that the administration is currently in the midst of concrete planning.
The final word will then be given to the city council.
He expects a decision this year, so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Air traffic control bottleneck gets worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, of the German Press Agency, ahead of the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known staff shortage in European air traffic control, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Europe-wide, the market for fully trained pilots is empty.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticised the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the federal, state, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compaction and overtime, it won't be possible without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the federal German air traffic control.
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission's guidance for the Lotsen-Misere.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 were far too low, he said.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings for national air traffic control systems are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut off air traffic control even further."
At the moment, the EU rules will be agreed by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is under constant pressure from airlines to lobby.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they themselves have sown in recent years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high cost of delays for the airlines will start a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a "voiced training and future pact," said Maas.
The annual admission of 120 pilots over the next five years, which has been announced so far, is just enough to offset the age-related drop-offs.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes in favour of group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim chief executive Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed chief executive at Sunday's meeting, the crisis-ridden group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff cuts beyond the already known cuts in administration.
After two resignations, the control board counts only eight heads on the capital side.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business will be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence at demos of policemen and Catalan pro-independence activists.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan pro-independence activists in Barcelona have seen violent clashes with scores of injured.
Some 3,000 police officers from across Spain gathered on Saturday, according to city officials, as some 6,000 pro-independence protesters also demonstrated.
The Catalan police, with a large contingent, tried to keep the two protest marches away from each other.
But pro-independence activists repeatedly tried to break the security barrier, according to the emergency services.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and throwing bullets.
According to the information, there were also riots between the participants of the various protest marches.
Rescuers say 24 people were injured.
Police said there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who took action almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Civil Guard find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish policemen were demonstrating in Barcelona, of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez asked AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they ditched us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"of course we want to support our comrades who have only done their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we're doing it in Barcelona because it's a big European city and there's more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the policeman asserted.
Breakdown allowed access to personal data of UK ministers
A security flaw in a mobile phone app caused the personal details of ministers and MPs from Britain's Conservative Tory party to be temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from strangers after the breakdown came to light a day before the Tory party congress in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hanover police report a serious traffic accident on Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people have died while driving their car against a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The emergency services are on the scene.

Football: Juve coach praises after top-flight: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker had "played the best match this evening along with the half hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record-breaking 3-1 (1-1) victory against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively bought star was the decisive man in the important match against the chaser, even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," said Allegri.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal submissions, Juve turned the game around after the early behind by scoring Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hanging off the worst chaser for the time being.
The goal-scorer brought in by Real Madrid initially put on former Bundesliga prop Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double (26/49th).
And after a corner with a header, Ronaldo also did the groundwork for the strike of defenseman Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who only had to push in just before the goal line.
"he gives a lot of templates," praised the trainer.
But Allegri, of course, also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We have to get even better at serving him," demanded the coach.
Best Juve goal scorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in his account.
With Ronaldo's purchase for more than 100 million euros, Juventus" overpower seems to be becoming even more stifling.
Seven wins in seven matches is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has a six-point lead over Naples.
The second in the standings, trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the entry of the already warned Mario Rui (58th) the top-flight was decided.
The Portuguese was forced off the pitch after getting too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German national has made his mark on Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool FC, was involved in all seven league matches.
The midfield player also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said was "half a hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the Turin side's 2-0 win and is banned for Tuesday's home match against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly bizarre performance, rapper Kanye West has garnered attention at the U.S. TV show "Saturday Night Live" over the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume raised eyebrows and question marks among the audience.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change just in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, one can only call him "Ye," according to the musician.
"The essence that used to be known as Kanye West," he tweeted, referring to the late singer Prince, when he took his stage name.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
The tenth album was already released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you,"" says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was simply more grippy, we almost never presented him with problems," the list of Hoetmar's shooting possibilities reads accordingly thinly.
Score twice in 90 minutes, which means that games can rarely be played in a positive way.
Football League A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two opportunities in the first round, but the first took advantage of Maik Krause from a sharp angle to the early lead (7th).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have raised Uphus, but after great preparation by Krause, he ditched free standing.
The hosts had only a double chance when first Moritz Höne failed Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and in the second shot Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the score became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61st) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all gave away.
In addition, Niklas Eilmann could not use a trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - for the guests (75th).
It wasn't until Nils Berheide stomped the ball over the line that the match was decided (81st).
"We had criticised ourselves harshly before, which was different today than in the last few weeks," was the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7th), 0:2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75th/Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think of it," he said.
"We didn't get access to them at all," he said, probably referring to the wing brace with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also to all the other green and white people who stood out with a collective offensive drive.
Nevertheless, he was able to laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winking cheekily and pulling from his players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had pulled themselves out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albachten, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for class.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"that was by far our best performance of the season," he says.
"How we come back after the 0:2, how we keep up against one of the top teams in the league over the entire season, that was really phenomenal."
This makes it all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top goalscorer Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in that game for that goal.
He set up the 2-0 win over the left for Fabian Fröhning (39th).
We knew that, but you can't take out a player like that completely.
"that was madness, what he did," Lewandowski enviously acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the side change, his own 11 equalised: McGill's free-kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long corner of the goal (45th).
After the side change, it was again McGill who scored the equaliser (59th).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a cracking, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalised (69th).
Despite overtime, Albersloh did not manage to counter the last Concordia hit (80th) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74th/Albanian).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the national league duel between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0-0.
Media: general Presidium of Dynamo Dresden resigns
According to media reports, the entire board of football's second division, Dynamo Dresden, has resigned.
In the evening, several media unanimously referred to a joint letter from the Committee of the Saxes.
At first there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal is to be internal power struggles with the former Bundesliga club.
Erdogan in Germany: politics instead of pomp
Good that he's gone again.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish president spent three days in Berlin and Cologne, and many thought he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing is offering around 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has indicated that he will personally pick up the price of tolerance in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
For example, Academy Director Udo Hahn credited him with proudly saying, "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors have already been with us." However, the fact that celebrities keep appearing at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, and on 29 September, the writer Frido Mann will attend a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's president, Emmanuel Macron, has also pledged to receive the Academy's "Tolerance Prize" in person in Tutzing, which in another category also receives TV presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The 80 or so meetings up to mid-2019 have it all.
"The pension is just not safe!" says a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"and to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarism without limit."
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - war makes a mockery of every humane idea."
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society, to the gap between rich and poor, to the radical change in work through digitalisation.
Academy Director Hahn said: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting on the 200th
On the occasion of Karl Marx's birthday, some are expecting more visitors to the direction of criticism of capitalism, while others are expecting a tendency "from the left to the centre."
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner envisioned gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (feeling) woman and the (feeling) man and what else there might be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
He is, on the one hand, the male sparring partner, who sometimes speaks up to the end of the sentence, and, on the other, a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner is so congenially harmonious that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, the way it fit the evening's red thread.
Teubner had brought into play a paradox: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: what would have come out of composing Mozart if "das Nannerl" had opened the door unexpectedly?
So Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Lied vom Tod," and from Mozart's G minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers were presented to the chansonette by Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association.
But the chairman, Heidemarie Markenbeck, did not allow himself to be taken for an additional thank you.
She had the idea to treat the duo to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

Controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk is allowed to remain chief executive at electric car maker Tesla, but must relinquish the chairmanship of the board.
Musk also agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to pay a double-digit million-dollar fine, the SEC said.
The background is Musk's surprise announcement in August that he wants to take Tesla off the stock market.
In its lawsuit, the SEC accused Musk of providing false and misleading information.
Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have slightly revised the number of victims down.
10 passengers, instead of 15, were slightly injured.
All have since been released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in hospital for one night for observation.
He will be fired later in the day, a police spokesman said.
The cause of the crash of the long-distance bus at Bruchsal is still unclear.
The long-distance bus had crashed head-on against a guardrail on Saturday morning.
Handball: Damen-Landesliga: Ahlener SG narrowly retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The women of Ahlen had problems especially with the third-division player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten hits.
"I was really happy with the defence, only one player scored too many goals.
We didn't get to grips with them," said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many missed opportunities.
The concentration in the end made his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore trailed behind almost to the end, was behind at the break at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45th).
Only towards the end did the broader bank of the hostesses make a decisive impact.
In addition, Aydogdu placed centre-back Merle Klement on left-back, who then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3. Liga Frauen: top performance of BSV Ostbevern in the top match at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the women's volleyball players of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd league West.
At the second-tier VC Allbau Essen, the blue-and-whites won 3-1.
"This was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
That's what we've come up with now," coach Dominik Münch was delighted after an almost impeccable performance by his team in the ousted league leader.
The first round was dominated by the guests almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12, he went to the runner-up of the previous year at 25:15.
Food has taken over in the two-seater bar, but has not come into play.
We kept them busy.
Our opponent has pitched at high risk, but has also produced a number of tickets.
In the second set, the BSV already led by 12:8. "Essen has changed the assumption to three-bar.
We couldn't keep the impact pressure.
Food has struggled, and we've had a bit of a lull," Münch added.
At 18:17, the women's volleyball players from the Ruhr region were ahead for the first time.
Although Ostbevern still fought off four set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," said the practice manager to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the tide in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly."
Over 7:3 and 15:13, the blue-and-white passage brought four to their side with 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: opening of mosque as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the large Ditib mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a shambles in German-Turkish relations, which can only be arduously swept together," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network of Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"rather than side by side with German leaders to underline the Muslims" affiliation with Germany, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu lamented.
The broad exclusion of the German public has "encouraged many reservations."
Heimatverein Nottuln: offer has already established itself
After the long summer break, Folktreff time is finally back.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln is already holding its fifth Nottingham folk meeting in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost to the day, it's been a year since we held a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our Folktreff would be eta-blated so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether storm Friederike in January or heatwave in July, the office's fireplace room was always packed.
"as always, the programme at the next Folktreff is a colourful mix of German folk, hiking and seafaring songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites friendly musicians to Nottingham.
Klaus Spellmeyer promised with his accordion for the first folk meeting "birthday."
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling," a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with German lyrics.
Now he's on the road with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff fondly remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten, with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht," delighted the audience and sent it home with an earful.
"We count on many happy guests to once again spend a convivial and humorous evening," says the invitation of the local club.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to play an active role is invited to join in.
Since the coveted seats are always quickly occupied, it is recommended to be there early enough.
The Folktreff begins at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China approves proposed merger between Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step towards becoming the world's largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
That leaves the approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the U.S. for the multi-billion-dollar merger.
Most recently, according to an insider, the chances of obtaining approval had improved because Linde promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and state maintenance was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last impulses were set for the district association for horticulture and nursing in Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday evening, he celebrated a big anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, he said otherwise at the time: as the "district fruit-growing association Kulmbach Stadt und Land" he was founded by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - in fact, it was all about fruit-growing, no one thought about flowers and horticulture at the time.
"at that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favourite child of the elites," said district nurse Günter Dippold in his keynote speech.
Fruit trees were to line trunk roads, so-called industrial gardens were created in schools.
Fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as the conveying of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" showed entertainingly how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can gather a similar amount of joy with Smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with councillor Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"The district association decides where they should stand," added Landrat Söllner, highlighting the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left district manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun in no doubt.
He led the many visitors with a picture presentation through the long history of the district association and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came from the garden, for the winter it was dug in.
By the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden had turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has endured, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," argued the expert for fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added the president of the Bavarian regional association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We must stop the glaring decline of insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif of the successful ceremony, which was ceremonially framed by the tower-blowers of the Musikverein Thurnau.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada's foreign minister moves U.N. speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: they give both trading partners an ultimatum for a deal.
Canada's foreign minister is now giving absolute priority to the trade deal - and is postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the U.N. General Debate in New York due to the pressure of time in the struggle to re-launch the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the U.S. and Mexico.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will not address the United Nations General Assembly until Monday, said her spokesman, Adam Austen.
In the meantime, she is focusing on renegotiating Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the U.S. had 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the U.S.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed in August to rewrite the Nafta regional free trade agreement.
Us President Donald Trump hinted that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks on a new edition have been going on for over a year.
They are due to be completed by Sunday evening (local time), with Trump's administration planning to present the deal to the U.S. Senate before October 1.
In the event of a breakdown in negotiations, Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report in the daily newspaper "O Globo."
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential election.
The politician was attacked in the street during a campaign rally in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations mobilized against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynistic statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital, Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to stand.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As an ex-mayor of the multi-million-dollar city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but is now presenting itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieves an absolute majority in the first round of voting, there will be a run-off on 28 October.
Observers say Bolsonaro won't emerge from this one successfully - no matter who he's up against.
Bolsonaro is known for hounding homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again, he is shocked with verbal derailments.
Another time, he said, the supporters of Lula's left-wing Workers" Party should be shot.
Europe reclaims Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just a hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairytale just outside Paris.
In front of more than 150,000 spectators over the three days at Le Golf National, captain Thomas Björn's outsider team dethroned the favored defending champion USA with a toothless Tiger Woods with great punches and outstanding team spirit.
After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen told Larsen's website.
At the deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become familiar with the band Gasolin', which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the break-up of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
In a statement on Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen hailed Larsen as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in all hearts."
The head of the government also recalled that the opponent of the monarchy, Larsen, had appeared in 2010 at the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a rewriting of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock from three other friendly bands.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of stage fright.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly excite the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the forthcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to the tuneful and powerful interplay.
Although "encore" calls cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand."
The fact that Hardrock is not the same as Hardrock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "high energy rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is used in "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, however, has gained a special reputation since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - is obvious and inaudible.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also sets his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In the meantime, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a revered solo to the sound that feels even higher than before, running through the audience.
A certain volume is, of course, part of the genre at such a hard rock concert: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to information from the mixing desk team, the three-part concert of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of a pneumatic hammer, but is thus still well below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval," to which "The Ignition" refers on its website.
Deafening 120 decibels in jet propulsion as usual in the annual Metal-Stelldichein in the north of the republic, however, the Ahlen audience does not need this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rockier gait have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone saw and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say at the end, albeit in a figurative sense.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in glider accident at Essen/Mülheim airport
A fatal accident occurred at the Mülheim/Essen airport.
A glider crashed in a car park at Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near the Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
As reported by the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung," a glider had crashed in the exhibition car park at the airport.
The pilot died in the process, he said.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is said to be a single-seater.
The plane had already landed at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just a short distance from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
The Mülheim/Essen airport is located at the city limits of the two Ruhr district towns and directly at the entrance to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park at large events in the fair Essen or the Gruga-Halle in Essen.
Trump stares at Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that the U.S. president of North Korea, Kim, is well-liked despite the nuclear crisis is no secret.
Now, however, Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "wonderful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has confessed to a new flame.
The tragic: it's a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old sprout of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, even though it turns out to be quite tough in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, so was he, and between us things went back and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And it's not just the talks with Kim that have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim's announcement of a halt to all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics have so far paid little more than lip service.
The U.S. president seemed well aware that the affection for the "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - which is notorious for its martial threatening gestures - is not likely to be common to everyone.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
It's so unpresidential.
But it doesn't bother him much, Trump declared, and then pointed his finger at the crowd: "I've always told you it's so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this packed arena, we'd only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, moody as well as spoiled by sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city centre cleaned itself out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest did not just take place in the marquee at the fire brigade tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to point out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya, allowing them to be rescued.
The group shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July at the risk of their lives and circulated it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said one man in the video message.
We're suffering here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"without the video, we would not have been able to return to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he said he put himself in mortal danger.
One of his comrades was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year with the help of the program, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
So far, however, he has not heard of a call for help via mobile phone video.
International organisations have long criticised the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the local elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her classes for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At about 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the front of the first floor, she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police, who started the investigation.
It is not yet possible to say whether things or money have been stolen.
Description of the perpetrator: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark trousers, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the police inspectorate Obernberg am Inn, phone number 059 133 4244.
German man was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to stay in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in central France after he stalled the car away from all the forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers accidentally spotted the car near a pasture on Saturday afternoon and freed the man who had been missing since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld reportedly was in good health despite the cold nights and long periods without care.
He said he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he failed to return from a ride on his SUV across the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search efforts, the man's whereabouts had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges the rule of law in Turkey
In talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) reportedly urged the rule of law in Turkey.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This mainly concerns waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important precondition for this."
Laschet also reportedly raised the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He said he expected freedom of expression to be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved at short notice to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's readiness to fly at Cologne airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Wahn Castle - but the owners of the castle rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their point of contact - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While U.S. President Trump never tires of emphasizing the successes in negotiating North Korea's denuclearization, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to be accommodating.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government at the U.N. general debate of using its continuing sanctions to block negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
"The latest standoff comes as the U.S. is building on coercive measures that are lethal for confidence building," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
That punitive measures could force North Korea to "knee" is "a pipe dream of people who don't know us."
In order to build confidence, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri pointed out.
However, there were no "responding reactions" from the U.S. side, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the U.N. Security Council decided on three sanctions against the internationally isolated country last year alone.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged strict compliance with the sanctions at the United Nations in the past few days.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the U.S. president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang again for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors to the house of the open door HoT got nothing from it: white blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power failure had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of service, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it on their own," said Westbuer.
And so everyone got on with it.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"cooks can't do better either," praised one visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the children and young people have set up," said the Rev. Frank Beckmann, while the magician Stephan Lammen was amazed with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the State Board of North Rhine-Westphalia of Tafel
Out of frustration with criticism from within his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has left his post in the regional association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned as vice-chairman of the North Rhine-Westphalia tablets in July, Sartor told Die Welt am Sonntag.
Too many have fallen into my back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-term deputy to the dpa.
Sartor took the harsh criticism with him.
"I can understand his move - there were people who didn't know exactly why the Essener Tafel did it."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday," Sartor once again criticised colleagues from other panels.
One should not take the approach "without us, the people in the city are starving to death."
It is the task of the state to ensure that people do not starve to death.
The Essendon man did not attend a congress of the panels on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm told too much sweet cuddly," he said.
There are all these social fuzzy people who criticised me in this way at the time.
SF Lorch loses 2-0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, district league Lorch loses to Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after arrears - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clear.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home match against TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment among the sports fans was great.
Quite different from the TV Heuchlingen: in Kirchheim, the TVH quickly lost 0-1, but won 2-1 after 90 minutes. At the top of the table, the SGB managed a 3-0 win.
Gladbach squanders two-run lead - Schalke without Embolo with first win
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals lose a lead twice.
Schalke are coming up against Mainz for their first win of the season (1-0).
 (SDA) Schalke have been sidelined four times in their first five league games with early opposition.
Now Domenico Tedesco's team once again showed the strength with which they finished first behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team head-to-head in the eleventh minute after strong preparation by Yevgeny Konopljanka, and subsequently the hosts preserved the mini pad with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund are once again from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had taken a 0-2 deficit against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but still managed to win 4-2 in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalised with a double within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was substituted by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided the crowning achievement after the break with another double in the closing stages (86th/94th).
The first victory was also won by the VfB Stuttgart.
Against Werder Bremen, who had already been decimated before the break due to a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, Stuttgarters had to fear in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious throw-in own goal that helped the guests to equalise in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to its first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a fully successful, but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers, who competed with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, twice gave a lead out of their hands, ultimately playing 2-2 and are still waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's 1-1 draw, Renato Steffen was in charge with his second Bundesliga goal.
In the flat shot from 20 metres of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, as was the second opponent after one hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite pernicious.
Alassane Pléa turns out to be a Goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record buyout, which came from the OGC Nice, hit for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh mandatory game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach finishes 4th.
Within 40 minutes, the previously undefeated Werder Bremen maneuvered into an uncomfortable position against the VfB Stuttgart.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt's team was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first goal of the season, and after 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: the 23-year-old Serb clinched yellow-red after a jersey victim against Daniel Didavi.
Admittedly, Stuttgart's defenders Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Brewers back into the game through a curious throw-in own goal (68th), a quarter of a hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters, who are in overtime, back on the road to victory.
Nuremberg won the match against Düsseldorf 3-0.
After half a hour, Hanno Behrens put the home team on track by foul-penalty.
Macedonians vote on new state name
In Macedonia today, around 1.8 million citizens are voting on whether to change their country's name in northern Macedonia.
A yes vote could resolve the nearly three-decade-old conflict with its neighbor, Greece.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name, blocking any rapprochement of Macedonia with the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future integration of the West.
The U.S. had announced that the country could quickly become a Nato member in the event of a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrians under arrest.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat up three female pensioners, in some cases seriously injuring them.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had been rioting in the runway in Alsergrund at around 10pm on Friday.
When the police arrived, they told the accused, who ran into passers-by with his fists clenched and tried to attack them, about his behaviour.
The Syrian then tried to beat and kick the officers.
Shortly afterwards, it emerged that the suspect had knocked three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) to the ground with his fists at a tram stop on Währinger Straße shortly before.
He also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered haematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for reasons unknown," as the police said.
He was taken to hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-term friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the go-ahead in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, it's right." He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the speakers of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir with a speech of rage on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"that was your Schabowski moment," he said, referring to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example, in adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters of hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Association of Children's Homes and the Society of Leprosy.
After all, around 400 metres of hedges around the gardens of the residents of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for around twelve supporters.
"We are doing this in order to reduce costs," explained the chairman of the citizens" association, Walter Schröer.
And there has been a lot of accumulating.
Due to the hot summer, we're late this time, but luckily it's just a cut of form.
The hedge had already been shaved once in the spring.
The breakfast, which always follows the work, also has a long tradition.
"Everyone should stick to their strength," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner takes gold at the World Canoe Slalom Championship
Augsburg's Hannes Aigner has won the gold medal at the conclusion of the World Canoe Slalom Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old put on a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, I've had enough rides here at the facility and it's all fit today," said the London 2012 Olympic third.
At the finish, he threw away his paddle with joy and raised both arms confidently - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had start number four.
But the six remaining starters couldn't top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was Czech Jiri Prskavec in front of Russian Pavel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempt to break into a single-family home this autumn.
Luckily, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to take advantage of again.
Yesterday, for example, the Gauting Police Inspectorate reported the first attempted burglary this autumn.
The fact that it remained at the single-family house on Königswieser Strasse is due to the alarm system.
After all, it started when the perpetrators laid hands shortly before 8 p.m. on Friday.
The burglars guessed that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them to such an extent that they took flight without prey.
Notes to PI Gauting, phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Hertha bust-up: caught up in reality: Bayern vs Ajax called for
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin "doesn't want to please" the FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interlude for Niko Kovac's tenure.
The first small performance under the new coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase to the greater autumnal low for the Munich team.
"a week ago, we still had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a bit of reality has caught up with us," noted Thomas Müller after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are pushing towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year without scoring an own goal, as at the same time of the pre-season two mandatory games in series without a win, the league table lost for the time being to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the record holder must be warned.
The FC Augsburg in the 1-1 draw with its intensive man-on-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle-sticks over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last overpowering Bayern are to be cracked after all.
"those who know FC Bayern know that we will not let this happen and we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again," stressed Kovac.
Apart from that, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his native town and merely blamed his first defeat as a Munich coach on the once again poor handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still make the first interim period of his term positive before the international break - otherwise the tone is likely to get worse.
For example, before this season's second premier class appearance after the 2-0 defeat at Benfica Lisbon, Kovac did not take any exceptional measures.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second round match against Ajax will start as planned, which also beat AEK Athens 3-0.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also score our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As was the case after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich in particular spoke plainly.
The right-hander appeared in the role of Mahner.
"I don't think it's all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the multitude of chances and make the mistakes at the back," said the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bayern were already five points behind Dortmund, who have now taken the lead by one point.
And so, with a twinkle in his eye, Kimmich was at least positive that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavarians has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in firing line: Özil-Causa: sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the authority of interpretation in the long-running dispute topic Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president heavily criticised the handling of the ex-world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the head of the DFB defended the association line.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the Causa in the ZDF sports studio in Mainz.
"In the future - because we also have many immigrant players in the U-teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that this kind of thing does not happen again," said the 57-year-old, and wants to win a national player without a migrant background as a further integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had strongly denounced a racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they allowed themselves to be photographed with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
Frankly, as their president, I couldn't stomach the fact that our two young men, who have joined the German national team, have been sidelined.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two of them with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced his intention to stand in front of players in the future.
That someone says: if I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - that's not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see any basis for Özil's return to the national team.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is to be appointed as a follow-up.
"If someone without a migrant background is clearly involved in society and football and says, "The issue is important, we have to take care of it," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his persona after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he plans to run for office as DFB president again next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - Police say the 75-year-old caused the accidents between 10am and 1pm on Friday.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
There was no exchange of personnel, however, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, police received a telephone message about a motorist who had come off the road and driven against a lead post.
Asked about this, the man did not want police on the spot and then drove off.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner got lost in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Eventually, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car suffered significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and couldn't remember much more.
The damage is around 1,300 euros.
Moorland fire in Meppen: Almost 1000 emergency personnel are still on duty.
Around four weeks after the moorland fire broke out on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 emergency personnel are still working on the extinguishing work.
The German Armed Forces announced this on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop in a stable way, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of emergency personnel is planned, it says.
On Sunday night, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster, which was declared just over a week earlier on 21 September, was cancelled because of fears that the flames were endangering neighbouring forests and settlements due to wind and sparks.
Then, on Thursday, it was said that there was no longer any risk of the fire spreading to neighbouring communities.
At times, more than 1500 emergency personnel tried to control the large-scale fire on the ground.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "tornadoes" are also planned for 2 and 5 October.
The fire was caused by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the moorland fire had at times moved up to a hundred kilometres across the north-west of Germany as far as Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr plans to set up a contact point to receive claims.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician married his long-term friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-term friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the go-ahead in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
When we get married, it's right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the speakers of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir with a speech of rage on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"that was your Schabowski moment," he said, referring to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example, in adoption law.
Referendum started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
The neighbor Greece insists on this because of its northern province of the same name.
For almost three decades, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and Nato as a means of exerting pressure.
If the citizens vote in favour, they will also give the go-ahead for their country's western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from oblivion
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the U.S. in 2016, leaving behind a work that preserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be taken only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant points out.
 (dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes will then be available from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be taken - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant points out.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases will a card be found at the crucial moment with possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very stressful," said Immer.
A similar registration system is already in place in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, according to Marita Völker-Albert, spokeswoman of the Federal Centre for Health Education.
"There is no register in which people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation on organ donation.
Under his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless they or relatives disagree.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head calcification
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world's head calculus champion.
He beat 39 comrades in Wolfsburg at the weekend.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue for the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The most recent World Cup participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, chief arbitrator Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organises the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example, 14,130,214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809.355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants competed against guests from the audience using calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was already present in Bielefeld two years ago as a 14-year-old at the time.
With terms like super brain, genius or child prodigy, organizer Laue can do little.
"head count can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even arithmetic competitions in stadiums.
Among the disciplines, for example, is the square root drawing of six-digit numbers.
When it comes to the calculation of versatility, the candidates are given surprise tasks, for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans also have good chances here, said the main arbitrator.
Otherwise, Asians are often at an advantage, because in early childhood, head calcification is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Powerful appeal: Video featuring naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows off her soulful and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to point out breast cancer and make a strong case for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings at the top without the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover up her most intimate places.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died from it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which involves breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams herself would have died almost a year ago.
There were complications at the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
Emergency surgery has been launched to save the baby's life.
A subsequent CT revealed clumps of blood in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government plans to significantly expand the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill on the so-called "Symbols Act" into review.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes out her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists from the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 metres at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 metres at high intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become wintry.
Farmers will be allowed to start annual kink maintenance on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start the annual knick-care on Monday.
The "green ramparts" that are unique in Germany have been shaping the landscape of the low-forest federal state for around 200 years.
The tree and scrub hedges, up to five metres wide, are "rolls" and, for many animals and plants, the last retreats.
Knicks connect scattered habitats as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still function, said Ingo Ludwichowski, managing director of the German Nature Conservation Union (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the orders of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and cattle fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also comes from that time: the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop due to the "knicking" of the branches.
Today, around 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a wooded, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a substitute habitat by around 7,000 animal species.
In one kilometre of knick, up to 1800 different species could live and up to 30 pairs of birds could breed.
However, the knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly cared for in winter.
Otherwise, it stunts into a light row of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
Kink care is only allowed to operate outside the breeding season from October to March, according to the Department of Agriculture.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesians talks about local SItuation
In an interview with the editorial network Deutschland (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive for more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport in Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills where they still hang out for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are staying in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and petrol stations are completely closed, people are stealing some food and petrol.
The civil service is completely down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the prisoners are walking around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information on the island work?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but it didn't work before and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people they don't know if they live and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, not a tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran into the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has affected a great many people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to give up Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo sustained a muscle tear in his back left thigh in the 2-1 win over Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga club announced on Sunday.
In Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscular rupture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games after the following international break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast of the downtime.
A muscular rupture usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscular rupture usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival is the annual closing of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the hymns to the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar nominees from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching Fire Department tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers on Lake Olching noticed a white injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was staying in the area of the water station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire brigade.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to dodge the emergency services again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to circle the animal and push it back to shore, where it was then put into a transport box after almost a hour by a firefighter with a bold handle.
The duck, injured in the chest, was then taken to the LMU veterinary clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But according to initial assessments, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard targets World Championship medal
In fourth place at Olympia, biathlete Julian Eberhard was in his stomach for a long time.
Next winter, the Saalfeldener wants to make up for the missed precious metal at the World Championships in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old the medal close to his grasp in the Pyeongchang Olympic sprint.
Seven tenths of a second ended up missing out on bronze.
"I deliberately left myself time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his home town of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to make up for the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back with the constitution to a major event, to win something.
At some point, you have to strike.
The World Cup venue in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track in my heart," he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the individual race in the previous year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN) the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter.
With the relay, he ran second in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at a turbocharged pace
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is severely limited.
With a turbo-charged FBI investigation, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the razor-thin majority for judicial nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been controversial over allegations of coercion.
President Donald Trump has given investigators a deadline of Friday to shed light on alleged incidents dating back more than 30 years.
The latest turn in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's appeal, accompanied by a culture fight, was sparked on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and first accuser Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer unleashed furious tirades against opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge on the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when, contrary to his initial announcement, Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared that he would agree, but demanded a FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party supporters agreed.
President Trump, who described Thursday's heavy pretensions as "chiss," initially refrained from further attacks against the women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune."
That way, final doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump lashed out at Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They're trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely limited the powers of investigators.
A government official told The Wall Street Journal that "they don't go on a fishing trip," they will investigate the well-known allegations of two women.
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar unit of the municipality of Ried, installed in a "civil vehicle" to monitor the speed limit, will be stationed at Gartenstraße from Monday, October 1, according to the municipality.
The Federal School Centre is also located there.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after beating Mainz: You felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief at Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
However, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home match against Mainz 05.
'I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area," said Schalke 04's sports executive - and breathed a sigh of relief.
After all, the Königsblauen still managed to wrap up the narrow 1-0 win against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first win of the season.
In fact, things could have been different.
After the lead given by Alessandro Schöpf 11th to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco, Tedesco said: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and pressing," the head obviously played more and more with the length of the game.
Don't actually make a header monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," said Heidel. "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore retreated further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counts of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his header: "I'm actually the worst header player in the team."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including, of course, Tedesco.
"We wanted to start presciently in the early stages and make a firework out of it," said Schalke's head coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Arguably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: royal blue missed, rather for clearer conditions to worry about.
The possibilities were finally there, for example, through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the bar 59./72. Or Amine Harit 62.
"then it wouldn't have been a treble victory," said Tedesco: "You've already felt the fear a bit."
So I'm glad we won.
With that, he wasn't the only bowler.
Fischbachau: smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be missed.
From around two kilometres away, a hiker observed a fire in the Leitzachtal valley at around 1.30pm on Sunday.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause was soon discovered by the police and fire brigade: a stranger had set fire to rubbish on a two-square-metre area on Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it appeared he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the blaze unattended.
And that's near the forest.
30 firefighters from Fischbachau were busy pulling apart and extinguishing.
Police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion on equal terms
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has once again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have set myself the task of bringing interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association that cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance in organising the evening.
El-Mafaalani gets into the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, solid figures and one or two jokes, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflicted issues: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts increasing despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at one table, and first-generation migrants sit at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to come to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to have a say.
This leads to conflict.
The decisive factor, therefore, is not whether one is politically on the right or on the left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?," he points out.
Initially rather muted, then the discussion is getting more and more lively.
And there is a need for speech.
From his perspective, an Afghan refugee tells two female teachers how they see successful or unsuccessful integration with pupils.
El-Mafaalani presides, not on stage, emblematic of the discussion: she's on par.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "it is only when we understand what the problem is that we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing session, he still listened to the questions of the guests and was intensively discussed in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win kick-offs
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have ended the first day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and away win.
Gießen won 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC in a hard-fought match in his own hall.
The ambitious Bonners won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first league leader of the season is Alba Berlin after Saturday's 112:55 gala against Science City Jena.
At the start of the new season, the German champions Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich already struggled to a 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80 on Saturday.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied to buy one of the properties in Landsham South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new Landsham-South development area on the open market.
Mayor Roland Frick says.
In addition, the application phase has been completed for the 20 plots that the municipality offers at more favourable terms and prices - similar to the previous local model.
A good 100 applications have been received, Frick said.
"The documents are currently being examined," with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Plieningen, the aim is to have drawn up the list of candidates for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the local council.
After that, the award can take place.
A total of 50 plots of land for single and semi-detached homes will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family homes with an expected eight units each.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and roads are to be paved soon.
A single plot as well as two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the open market, 20 plots in a socially acceptable model.
The municipality's two apartment buildings are to be built as affordable housing, according to Frick.
With a total of 16 state-sponsored, income-oriented apartments.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated, housing for about 200 people is being created on the area of the new Landsham-South development area.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start for the new construction of a daycare center is taking place there.
It will house three kindergarten and three crib groups, as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalke's Naldo "great sport" also succeeds on the bench
Not in the starting XI for the third time in a row: Nonetheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not sat in the Schalke starting XI for the third time in a row, but on the interchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people if the Brazilian, who is almost two metres tall, had really spoken the frustration of his soul.
But when the Schalke players gathered in the centre circle as usual after the 1-0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his pros, the 36-year-old, who everyone simply calls Naldo, turned on and said: "We have to thank, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his reservist existence, had no grudges at all.
Wahrscheinlích knows Naldo, who was hailed as the best bowler last season, that he hasn't actually fallen on the sidelines with his coach - but is getting a break for good reasons.
A reason called "burden control."
It wasn't easy to tell him
"It wasn't easy to tell him, I'll tell you quite honestly," Tedesco reported from the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the starting line-up.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the club," Tedesco justified the move.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can snap at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," said Tedesco, explaining the rotation that last caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving to be an exemplary team player on the bench.
In August, the mood in Austria's industry accelerated its decline compared to the euro zone.
The Purchasing Managers" Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low at 46.7 points.
Across Europe, Austria still has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday about its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone's PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1, but the index is still below the 50 mark for the 13th month in a row, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry broke that threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The Greeks were bottom (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but more slowly than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March, at 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened slide may mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But the industry - at least in the third quarter - remains the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro zone fell as much as they have not since November 2011.

Tuchel's PSG team manage eighth win in eighth league game
September 29, 2018 at 7:45 p.m.
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel continues to rush from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won 3-0 (1-0) thanks to two hits from superstar Neymar and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon in France had made such a good start to the season 82 years ago.
Brazilian Neymar put PSG ahead after 22 minutes and produced the final score in the aftermath.
Christopher Nkunku (46th) was responsible for the intermittent 2-0 win.
In doing so, Paris also passed the dress rehearsal for Wednesday's landmark second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade.
At the start of the premier class, Tuchel's team had suffered the only mandatory defeat so far this season in the 2-3 draw at Liverpool.
