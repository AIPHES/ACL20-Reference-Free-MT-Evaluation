Treysa has to fight with vandalism and filth
The entry into the 36 km long railway cycle path in the rotkäppchenland in treysa presents itself hard to find and okay.
Recipes against the vandalism of vandalism are wanted, but solutions are hardly drawing.
Shards, cigarette, garbage and filth, broke bin and now dismantled signs - this is how the entry with seats has been presented to the cycle path on the far hill in treysa.
For the stellar track cycle path in the rotkäppchenland a more than agenda sight.
The topic deals with members of the adfc-Chapter City but also others already longer, according to the cycling officer of the city of ulrich desert.
The problem has already been addressed in the Cycling Advisory Committee.
A solution doesn't give it so far.
The proposals ranged from the laying of the seats to the regular emptying of the waste container and cleaning of the surfaces at the point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible other activities", says desert.
Guido Hahn (Adfc) reports that the topic has also been presented in the hechtsheim.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents - the seats is a regular meeting place to celebrate at weekends.
It's not only often loud, in the binges it is also destroyed: JAMB from the earth ripped, trash bin trashed, signs snapped, seats smeared.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often, tells adfc member Susanne Klippert.
However, the actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
You are annoyed that the resting place on the bike path in treysa is meeting point for hootenanny.
"along the entire path, there is clearly the focus on the far hill", confirms the cycling officer, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"suffer the same fate, it will be really expensive".
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: " possibly, this sets the threshold significantly higher to? In the public domain.
That would require a quick return to a police soon.
In Principle, Desert Hagen wishes a development of the far hill.
It must be made more attractive.
With the behavior of the path so far, you can be very satisfied.
The tourist marketing is still in progress.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany ", so the adfc members.
As a very critical hazard, adfc member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation in the ashes of röder in treysa.
There is no cornering trail on the far hill.
In their traffic it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between mutual traffic flow ", explains them.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for older ones and especially for children.
Music contest in the kulturbahnhof: the "Kö of hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for the music contest was a success, creative and in each other.
" D a song for hiltrup " to, is the appeal of the district offensive hiltrup, in the " music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians ".
A contest "with wink in the likeable hilt ruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, soon it was a family with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the culture station.
Seven formations appeared, from the one-man band to the great ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long in hiltrup living albachtener, the nine of the "Hilt Ruper star colors", three members and three generations of families tren and Claus, an ensemble from the kindergarten lummer land and finally rike weßling and the zwarties.
This contest, according to Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We haven't experienced this in other districts.
What did the writers look like?
In the places, the hilt ruper lake and the market avenue were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig was the avenue in his schlager-like song to the "Kö of hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof has also been honoured.
Again and again it was about the experience of each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short film series with short interviews with the artists or clues to their creation.
That's how you learned from humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now also teach guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Sh, Franke knew that the recently performed in ludwigshafen - at a big event of basf with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed a lot on youtube meanwhile.
"it's not about winning", had franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the hilt of ruper gastronomy.
For the favorites of the jury, there was still something special - so that others can hear their songs.
A whole cd can be done by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel untied with sound engineer sh.
More musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his hiltrup schlager, which impressed franke especially with his musicality, and the " Lummer Land Pack ": " a very nice appearance " with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and lina great.
Like everyone, the kids came up again to the final - and even sounded " really good " without electronic support ", as franke said.
The jury has been guided by the aspects of originality, reference to hiltrup, catchiness of melody and recognition.
The Jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the westphalian school for music, Andreas Klomfaß from the kvg gymnasium and Oliver ahlers from the grouping as well as jan kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The District offensive had launched the event for the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She appreciated the event as a full success.
All of them are " very satisfied ", and " the atmosphere was good " in the soon very full kulturbahnhof.
The Word Game: "Decrypto" in the spieletest
The players form two teams that sitting each other.
For each page there is a view umbrella, in it four cards with keywords that you can only decipher - the old trick with the red foil - when you have been in it.
So it is ensured that the opposite can also not read anything by mistake.
On The Cards, for example, you can read from left to right: " 1. Renaissance.
2. Windows.
3. Dice.
4. Fest ".
These are the terms that it is now to be encrypt.
Because you shouldn't be guessed here the terms, but codes.
Alternately one player per team is the ver.
He gets a code card on which maybe "3.4.2" is standing.
To be guessed in "Decrypto" not the terms behind the secret foil, but its codes.
His task in this case: in this order and in this example, he should describe the terms " Dice ", " Fest " and " window " - so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as possible not; because that wins the game when it manages twice to crack the code.
So the ver noted and reads loud: " throw " for the dice, " loose " as opposed to feast; here would of course also be something like " party " possible and " Prague " because he paid attention at school and the that's where defenestration knows.
This is how round for round, team for team continues.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but it can be better with every clue that the ver is giving there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too close, the to should be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is unfortunately the most popular.
The players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanatory video under decrypto. Info on the net makes it easier.
But if you have a started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this nondescript game.
In Total, " Decrypto " is not quite as conclusive as predecessor and genre primus " code names ", which also gives an agent theme to a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And to whom it's only about guessing and not about points, it can also easily a version for two dazuerfinden.

Depot Pressig was home of thrust locos
The Depot in pressig has been the hub in the frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"when buffers hit buffers, you heard it all over the place", remember georg spelt, who archived the history of the place and the station.
That didn't encourage anyone.
There's also the brakes and ' the wagons.
That was just railway pur.
Statements that are figuratively for dinkles's home pressig.
Nowhere in the frankenwald a place was shaped so by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the ramps-mountain to the north, which after an increase of about 220 meters of altitude has its vertex in steinbach on the forest.
In order to cope with this, train and thrust locos were used earlier, which had their home in pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 Roundhouse, Apprentice Workshop, line and railway.
"the heart was the hub, which after a renovation in 1899 had a diameter of 18 meters", tells norbert heidrich from hirschaid, railway historian and for 47 years professional railway workers.
From The Depot (BW) Pressig, which was under the control of 1968 Bamberg, locomotives were also used for the secondary pressig - tettau, Louis - Lehesten, stockheim - sonneberg and kronach - north half farms.
On July 15., 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight locos were stationed in pressig.
The Electrification of the route 1939 is already minimized the need for train and thrust locomotives.
From 1977, they were only needed at trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 weighing were ranked in the month.
In 1982, parts of the operating plant were cancelled, 1991 the rest was cancelled.
Heidrich: "it is regrettable that you have not seen a better use of the site, even in terms of freight transport".
On Pentecost in 1989, the railway nuremberg celebrated its anniversary "50 years of electrification nuremberg - saalfeld" a fancy station fest in pressig.
"there were 10 000 enthusiastic viewers here", remember georg spelt.
Little later this out.
On June 1., 1991, the last 30 men were deducted, the marshalling yard pressig was history.
"the rangi and obstacle leger made the most difficult work in trains", reminds spelt.
Every mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station of pressig-Rothen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures are available here in the infra plus article.

Germany: Schw laments differences between east and west
Berlin - before the day of unity, deputy spd leader manuela schw has appealed to all countrymen not to accept the disadvantage of east Germans.
There are differences that are pain after almost 30 years of unity.
With these differences, we must not be satisfied ", said the prime minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the " Tagesspiegel on Sunday ".
The goal must remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.

"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after the German unity", said schw.
North Korea: does this cute dog end the korea conflict?
The One-Year-old pung is supposed to smooth the waves between the two korea.
In Pursuit of a relaxation of relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has made a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae in two north korean pung san hounds.
As Moons's office announced on Sunday, the two about one year old dogs reached their recipient already on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to make the animals "acclimatization".
The dogs with the thick white fur, lace ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the democratic people's Republic of

Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?

New week, new chance for the government
Back to the work - this is the unofficial motto for the great coalition's starting working week today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and their ministers from cdu, spd and also from csu did not last summon the "return to the work" Mantra.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other active citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but be drum.
If the federal government is now ready to devote itself to its mission - to govern it -, you should not stop it now with term debates.
Whether Union and spd can actually bring something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks, it may already show Monday.
In the evening, the peaks of the parties come together to the koalitionsausschuss.
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, there are more topics on the agenda with the diesel engine and the skilled worker s' group.
CSU Transport Minister scouring wants to let the automakers get away with exchange premiums, spd and cdu see the manufacturers in the obligation to technical retrofitting of older diesel.
While there has been a rapprochement in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the union and spd are still far apart at the planned skilled worker s' training.
The spd calls for a bleibeperspektive for rejected asylum seekers who work or make an education.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "Gauge" from the asylum system into the labour market.
So there will be a fight again among the partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal and equal has teamed up to the groko, but three partners with some very different gesellschaftsbildern and priorities.
Fight is good.
Without a dispute, a society that is so diverse, sometimes contradictory, is not progressing.
But in order to be constructive, quarrel should not be returned to the question of being or be for reasons of reason.
It's still about politics, not about theatre.
Union and spd are supposed to argue - but always have a look at the human rights of people.
What is doable and beneficial to many?
With this theme, both the diesel and the gauge question can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Especially that's why the parties have to fight now.
Mushroom checking working hours at hartinger
Minister in visor
Is there a violation of the applicable law on the law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"really day and night" your put would have worked on the good, reported a effusive minister at the presentation, two weeks ago.

Even at fc gütersloh, it only ranged to a 0:0 Draw.
The lowest and the antepenultimate be them in front of 438 spectators in the heide waldstadion as gathered of.
The first half was manageable by the unterhaltungsfaktor arg.
If you'd rather get a beer or a bratwurst, you couldn't do that.
There was no danger of missing a torchance, because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) goal of the whole lot, güterslohs nick flock was responsible for the 28. TH MINUTE.
The best - and in principle the only real one - had the ahlener, when cihan yilmaz fcg goalkeeper frederic wester forced him to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced by injury, for him sinan aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48. th minute, Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters was just about the housing and after an hour, the gütersloh also appeared offensive for the first time.
After a ball conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz, it went fix.
The Fast-voiced counter about sinan aygün's "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a however tabs in the arms of rwa goalkeeper bernd schip.
In addition, they laid with a header of wieckowicz (66.) after a corner of the ex-Ahle Tim Manstein.
RWA-Manager Angelo Daut responded, first brought marko onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later enes güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It caused - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the ahlener did not achieve.
Only in the 91. th minute, cihan yilmaz had the last chance, but also that didn't bring anything.
Angelo Daut tried then, the positive to: "I like that we played at zero". but unfortunately, the zero was also in front.
"we were not as dangerous as we were still against wood and that even though our opponent had no desire to play here", stated rw åhléns manager.
Offensive " droning all so a little " against a team, " that only wanted to defend.
Anyway, I didn't feel like we could get a conceding ", so daut.
As a spectator, however, he did not feel like his team could shoot a goal.
The idea was too bad for that.
Recke Thanksgiving Market: Fortunately, there is enough kreimers
This is Brigitte in, Petra Grone and elke fritzler from the recke table, for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "these donations remain in reckenfeld too".
At the opening, the sky showed bright blue, but the place was still a bit empty, but that should change during the day.
Because: "here it is so beautifully sociable, that's why we're here today", said a visitor.
Organizer of the feast Franz Josef Get welcomed the guests in the kiepenkerl outfit as always with a proper pinch of humor.
For the married couple, who should actually be compensated against food, ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in the short term.
The Verena (daughter of ferdi kreimer) has become sick.
But there are enough kreimers.
And the "Replacement" didn't let it take to entertain the more and more visitors in between.

At many stands was worked for the birth.
From sweet to savory everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in reckenfeld for a year, has been creative at his dekupiersäge.
Veneer Work, coasters with recke motifs and a lot more he had on offer.
A specialty offered three Recke Beekeepers: "recke fields honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Busch Schlüter.
The last one has a specialty in it.
Honey in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access again and again, so well tasted the cake.
The Conviviality is that the visitors will stay long until the evening, even without the group that does not exist at the harvestfest.
Graffiti with local political message: no successful advertising for skate plant
In Lenger I have advertised unknown in a hardly beneficial way for the construction of a skate plant.
In several places there are corresponding graffiti, says jürgen kohne from the city council on request of the wn.
In at least one case, the police complaint has been filed for criminal prosecution.
In Large letters, on signs among other things at the gempt-Hall and at the old town hall the three words " skatepark for lenger me!".
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering was discovered on the obervintl on the staircase to the gempt bistro on 19. September, after the occupation of choice on September 19. th.
Since the short message seems to have been left "only" with a sharpie, it could be removed easily.
"a few days later, this was back, this time sprayed", so rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding obervintl must be replaced.
A special note just gets this case by the fact that several large companies from lenger are also called me on the board.
If the skate plant is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
Commitments already exist, explains jörg hessel from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without calling names.
Well possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical with those companies that are on the cracklings board.
For years, local and administration have been dealing with the theme of skate plant.
After the old one had been dismantled at the fiber optic clinic, after some time, the search for an alternative location began.
After all, the council spoke mostly for the fire brigade parking lot.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, a turnaround followed.
The members of the main and financial committee are now unanimous in favour of the area of gutenberg school.
Jürgen Kohne says at the stand of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word then has the city council.
He goes from a decision this year, so that in a positive vote 2019 could be built.

Frankfurt / Hamburg after the European summer weather in summer, the German air traffic controllers do not see any signs of improvement next year.
"this year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes", said the boss of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency before the aviation summit on October 5. th in Hamburg.

Europe is the market for fully trained pilot pilots.

And there were many corners and many balls in our goal ", said the sportvorstand of schalke 04-and breathed.
After all, the royalblues was still able to bring the scarce 1:0 against the rhenish hesse over time and thus the first season under roof and compartment.
It could have actually come differently.
After the leadership of Alessandro Schöpf 11. of the team of head coach domenico tedesco gave security, Tedesco: "in sum, the first half was good, both playful and from the pressing"., obviously more and more of the head played a role with increasing duration.
Actually not a header monster
" the last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me ", said heidel: " if the team was only half as nervous as I am on the bench, I can understand that ".

El-Mafa is very easily entering the reading, describes the book of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic understandable.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and one or other joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most powerful themes: Migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, are becoming increasingly conflicts?
The Syrian author is used to answer the question of a metaphor.
At a table, the German society is sitting, the first generation migrants at the loser.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they always sat at the big table and now want to be part of it.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not crucial whether you are politically right or left, but: " am I for or against an open society?", he emphasizes.
At First, rather behavior, then always lively runs the roundtable.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell you how to see successful or not successful integration in students.
El-Mafa is ahead, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not push his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "first, if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions", says EL-Mafa.
Even during the subsequent signing, he still has an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, has been intensively discussed.
